let us forget . what matters it that we <eos> once reigned o'er happy realms of long ago <eos> and talked of love , and let our voices low <eos> and ruled for some brief sessions royally <eos> what if we sung , or laughed , or wept maybe <eos> it has availed not anything , and so <eos> let it go by that we may better know <eos> how poor a thing is lost to you and me <eos> but yesterday i kissed your lips , and yet <eos> did thrill you not enough to shake the dew <eos> from your drenched lids — and missed , with no regret <eos> your kiss shot back , with sharp breaths failing you <eos> and so , to day , while our worn eyes are wet <eos> with all this waste of tears , let us forget <eos>
the hills are gleaming brass , and bronze the peaks <eos> the mesas are a brazen , molten sea <eos> and e'en the heaven 's blue infinity <eos> undimmed by kindly cloud through arid weeks <eos> seems polished turquoise . like a sphinx she speaks <eos> the scornful desert : “ what would'st thou from me <eos> and in our hearts we answer her ; all three <eos> unlike , for each a different treasure seeks <eos> one sought adventure , and the desert gave <eos> his restless heart found rest beneath her sands <eos> one sought but gold . he dug his soul a grave <eos> the desert 's gift worked evil in his hands <eos> one sought for beauty ; him she made her slave <eos> turn back ! no man her ‘ witched gift withstands <eos>
when death , or adverse fortune 's ruthless gale <eos> tears our best hopes away , the wounded heart <eos> exhausted , leans on all that can impart <eos> the charm of sympathy ; her mutual wail <eos> how soothing ! never can her warm tears fail <eos> to balm our bleeding grief 's severest smart <eos> nor wholly vain feign 'd pity 's solemn art <eos> tho ’ we should penetrate her sable veil <eos> concern , e'en known to be assum 'd , our pains <eos> respecting , kinder welcome far acquires <eos> than cold neglect , or mirth that grief profanes <eos> thus each faint glow worm of the night conspires <eos> gleaming along the moss 'd and darken 'd lanes <eos> to cheer the gloom with her unreal fires <eos>
and thou , o river of to morrow , flowing <eos> between thy narrow adamantine walls <eos> but beautiful , and white with waterfalls <eos> and wreaths of mist , like hands the pathway showing <eos> i hear the trumpets of the morning blowing <eos> i hear thy mighty voice , that calls and calls <eos> and see , as ossian saw in morven 's halls <eos> mysterious phantoms , coming , beckoning , going <eos> it is the mystery of the unknown <eos> that fascinates us ; we are children still <eos> wayward and wistful ; with one hand we cling <eos> to the familiar things we call our own <eos> and with the other , resolute of will <eos> grope in the dark for what the day will bring <eos>
yes ! i once bore that title , and my heart <eos> thought nobler of itself , that one so good <eos> so honor 'd , so rever 'd , should give it me <eos> o isola ! when that glad season comes <eos> which brought redemption to a ruin 'd world <eos> and , like thee , hides beneath the snow of age <eos> a gay , benevolent , and feeling heart <eos> i hop 'd again to hear thy tongue repeat <eos> with youthful warmth and zealous energy <eos> those passages , where poetry assumes <eos> an air divine , and wakes th ’ attentive soul <eos> to holy rapture ! then you promis 'd me <eos> the luxury to weep o'er dante 's muse <eos> and fair italia 's loftier poets hail <eos>
“ not all ” — the echoes answer me — “ not all <eos> “ prophetic sounds and loud , arise forever <eos> “ from us , and from all ruin , unto the wise <eos> “ as melody from memnon to the sun <eos> “ we rule the hearts of mightiest men — we rule <eos> “ with a despotic sway all giant minds <eos> “ we are not impotent — we pallid stones <eos> “ not all our power is gone — not all our fame <eos> “ not all the magic of our high renown <eos> “ not all the wonder that encircles us <eos> “ not all the mysteries that in us lie <eos> “ not all the memories that hang upon <eos> “ and cling around about us as a garment <eos> “ clothing us in a robe of more than glory <eos>
my frail and earthly bark , by reason 's guide <eos> which holds the helm , whilst will doth wield the sail <eos> by my desires , the winds of bad betide <eos> hath sailed these worldly seas with small avail <eos> vain objects serve for dreadful rocks to quail <eos> my brittle boat from haven of life that flies <eos> to haunt the sea of mundane miseries <eos> my soul that draws impressions from above <eos> and views my course , and sees the winds aspire <eos> bids reason watch to scape the shoals of love <eos> but lawless will enflamed with endless ire <eos> doth steer empoop , [ b ] whilst reason doth retire <eos> the streams increase ; love 's waves my bark do fill <eos> thus are they wracked that guide their course by will <eos>
“ my eyes were blind with passion as i read <eos> i tore the letter into bits and stamped <eos> upon them , ground my teeth and cursed the day <eos> i met her , to be jilted . all that night <eos> my thoughts ran riot . round the room i strode <eos> a raving madman — savage as a sioux <eos> then flung myself upon my couch in tears <eos> and wept in silence , and then stormed again <eos> ‘ beggar ! ’ — it raised the serpent in my breast <eos> mad pride — bat blind . i seized her pictured face <eos> and ground it under my heel . with impious hand <eos> i caught the book — the precious gift she gave <eos> and would have burned it , but that still small voice <eos> spake in my heart and bade me spare the book <eos>
“ were man indeed the only hope of man <eos> i never would reprove thee for thy tears <eos> but , they are vain ! man has a surer trust <eos> the helpless , weary , miserable wretch <eos> left by his fellows in the wilderness <eos> shall be supported in that trying hour <eos> by a right arm , which , in his days of strength <eos> he did not lean upon ! a gracious arm <eos> which wounds the sick , and heals them by the stroke <eos> o ! lora ! to the father of the world <eos> a judge so patient and so merciful <eos> that he refuses not the latest sigh <eos> nor suffers sorrow but as means to save <eos> canst thou not trust the objects of thy care <eos>
she back four paces drew , at first , through shame <eos> then , led by love , eight others forward came <eos> but scruples still arose that ardour foiled <eos> and nearly ey'ry thing had truly spoiled <eos> anne had a conscience pure as holy fire <eos> but how could she abstain from soft desire <eos> if , in the bosom chance a flame should raise <eos> is there a pow'r can then subdue the blaze <eos> at first these inclinations she withstood <eos> but doubting soon , how those of flesh and blood <eos> could sins commit by stepping in advance <eos> she took her seat upon the green expanse <eos> and there attentively the lad observed <eos> with eyes that scarcely from him ever swerved <eos>
so shall i live , supposing thou art true <eos> like a deceived husband , so love 's face <eos> may still seem love to me , though altered new <eos> thy looks with me , thy heart in other place <eos> for there can live no hatred in thine eye <eos> therefore in that i cannot know thy change <eos> in many 's looks , the false heart 's history <eos> is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange <eos> but heaven in thy creation did decree <eos> that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell <eos> whate'er thy thoughts , or thy heart 's workings be <eos> thy looks should nothing thence , but sweetness tell <eos> how like eve 's apple doth thy beauty grow <eos> if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show <eos>
lift up your eyes ! behold these pictured walls <eos> look where the flood of western glory falls <eos> through the great sunflower disk of blazing panes <eos> in ruby , saffron , azure , emerald stains <eos> with reverent step the marble pavement tread <eos> where our proud mother 's martyr roll is read <eos> see the great halls that cluster , gathering round <eos> this lofty shrine with holiest memories crowned <eos> see the fair matron in her summer bower <eos> fresh as a rose in bright perennial flower <eos> read on her standard , always in the van <eos> “ truth , ” — the one word that makes a slave a man <eos> think whose the hands that fed her altar fires <eos> then count the debt we owe our scholar sires <eos>
because i oft in dark abstracted guise <eos> seem most alone in greatest company <eos> with dearth of words , or answers quite awry <eos> to them that would make speech of speech arise <eos> they deem , and of their doom the rumour flies <eos> that poison foul of bubbling pride doth lie <eos> so in my swelling breast , that only i <eos> fawn on myself , and others do despise <eos> yet pride , i think , doth not my soul possess <eos> which looks too oft in his unflattering glass <eos> but one worse fault , ambition , i confess <eos> that makes me oft my best friends overpass <eos> unseen , unheard , while thought to highest place <eos> bends all his powers , even unto stella 's grace <eos>
some men i have beheld with wonderment <eos> noble in form and feature , god 's design <eos> in whom the thought must search , as in a mine <eos> for that live soul of theirs , by which they went <eos> thus walking on the earth . and i have bent <eos> frequent regard on women , who gave sign <eos> that god willed beauty , when he drew the line <eos> that shaped each float and fold of beauty 's tent <eos> but the soul , drawing up in little space <eos> thus left the form all staring , self dismayed <eos> a vacant sign of what might be the grace <eos> if mind swelled up , and filled the plan displayed <eos> each curve and shade of thy pure form were thine <eos> thy very hair replete with the divine <eos>

the hostess whispered him she thought her spouse <eos> again , my dear , such sparks let 's never house <eos> pray do n't you hear how they together chat <eos> just then the husband raised himself and sat <eos> is this your plan ? said he with mighty rage <eos> was it for this you would my house engage <eos> you understand me , but i 'll seek redress <eos> think you so very cheap to have success <eos> what , would you ruin families at will <eos> and with our daughters take at ease your fill <eos> away , i say ! my house this moment quit <eos> and as for you , abominable chit <eos> i 'll have your life : this hour you breathe your last <eos> such creatures only can with beasts be classed <eos>
through armes and vassals rome the world subdu 'd <eos> that one would weene that one sole cities strength <eos> both land and sea in roundnes had survew 'd <eos> to be the measure of her bredth and length <eos> this peoples vertue yet so fruitfull was <eos> of vertuous nephewes *, that posteritie <eos> striving in power their grandfathers to passe <eos> the lowest earth ioin 'd to the heaven hie <eos> to th'end that , having all parts in their power <eos> nought from the romane empire might be quight <eos> and that though time doth commonwealths devowre <eos> yet no time should so low embase their hight <eos> that her head , earth 'd in her foundations deep <eos> should not her name and endles honour keep <eos>
dost think that time , to whom stars vainly sue <eos> will for thy beauty keep one fix è d place <eos> or that he may , o'erhyppphenweighed with seasons due <eos> forget one spring where veinlet tendrils lace <eos> rose over rose to make this flower , thy face <eos> look round thee now , dear dupe of sweet hey day <eos> of what once blooming joy canst thou find trace <eos> save in the bosom of a cold decay <eos> what violet of summer 's yester sway <eos> usurps these clouds to throne her slender moon <eos> look on the wrinkling year , the shrunken way <eos> the wintry bier of all that gaudy shone <eos> and gather love ere loveliness wear pall <eos> if thou , when all is gone , wouldst still have all <eos>
lady , thou weepest for the maniac 's woe <eos> and thou art fair , and thou , like me , art young <eos> oh ! may thy bosom never , never know <eos> the pangs with which my wretched heart is wrung <eos> i had a mother once — a brother too <eos> ( beneath yon yew my father rests his head <eos> i had a lover once , and kind and true <eos> but mother , brother , lover , all are fled <eos> yet , whence the tear which dims thy lovely eye <eos> oh ! gentle lady — not for me thus weep <eos> the green sod soon upon my breast will lie <eos> and soft and sound will be my peaceful sleep <eos> go thou , and pluck the roses while they bloom <eos> my hopes lie buried in the silent tomb <eos>
so in cheapside , what time aurora peeps <eos> a mingled noise of dustmen , milk , and sweeps <eos> falls on the housemaid 's ear : amazed she stands <eos> then opes the door with cinder sabled hands <eos> and “ matches ” calls . the dustman , bubbled flat <eos> thinks ‘ tis for him and doffs his fan tail 'd hat <eos> the milkman , whom her second cries assail <eos> with sudden sink unyokes the clinking pail <eos> now louder grown , by turns she screams and weeps   <eos> alas ! her screaming only brings the sweeps <eos> sweeps but put out — she wants to raise a flame <eos> and calls for matches , but ‘ tis still the same <eos> atoms and housemaids ! mark the moral true   <eos> if once ye go astray , no match for you <eos>
i must not grieve , my love , whose eyes would read <eos> lines of delight , whereon her youth might smile <eos> flowers have time before they come to seed <eos> and she is young , and now must sport the while <eos> and sport , sweet maid , in season of these years <eos> and learn to gather flowers before they wither <eos> and where the sweetest blossom first appears <eos> let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither <eos> lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air <eos> and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise <eos> pity and smiles do best become the fair <eos> pity and smiles must only yield thee praise <eos> make me to say , when all my griefs are gone <eos> happy the heart that sigh 'd for such a one <eos>
the soft west wind , returning , brings again <eos> its lovely family of herbs and flowers <eos> progne 's gay notes and philomela 's strain <eos> vary the dance of springtide 's rosy hours <eos> and joyously o'er every field and plain <eos> glows the bright smile that greets them from above <eos> and the warm spirit of reviving love <eos> breathes in the air and murmurs from the main <eos> but tears and sorrowing sighs , which gushingly <eos> pour from the secret chambers of my heart <eos> are all that spring returning brings to me <eos> and in the modest smile , or glance of art <eos> the song of birds , the bloom of heath and tree <eos> a desert 's rugged tract and savage forms i see <eos>
shall we , too , rise forgetful from our sleep <eos> and shall my soul that lies within your hand <eos> remember nothing , as the blowing sand <eos> forgets the palm where long blue shadows creep <eos> when winds along the darkened desert sweep <eos> or would it still remember , tho ’ it spanned <eos> a thousand heavens , while the planets fanned <eos> the vacant ether with their voices deep <eos> soul of my soul , no word shall be forgot <eos> nor yet alone , beloved , shall we see <eos> the desolation of extinguished suns <eos> nor fear the void wherethro ’ our planet runs <eos> for still together shall we go and not <eos> fare forth alone to front eternity <eos>
youth gone , and beauty gone if ever there <eos> dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this <eos> youth gone and beauty , what remains of bliss <eos> i will not bind fresh roses in my hair <eos> to shame a cheek at best but little fair <eos> leave youth his roses , who can bear a thorn <eos> i will not seek for blossoms anywhere <eos> except such common flowers as blow with corn <eos> youth gone and beauty gone , what doth remain <eos> the longing of a heart pent up forlorn <eos> a silent heart whose silence loves and longs <eos> the silence of a heart which sang its songs <eos> while youth and beauty made a summer morn <eos> silence of love that cannot sing again <eos>
what wrongs the oppressor suffered , these we know <eos> these have found piteous voice in song and prose <eos> but for the oppressed , their darkness and their woe <eos> their grinding centuries ,— what muse had those <eos> though hall and palace had nor eyes nor ears <eos> hardening a people 's heart to senseless stone <eos> thou knewest them , o earth , that drank their tears <eos> o heaven , that heard their inarticulate moan <eos> they noted down their fetters , link by link <eos> coarse was the hand that scrawled , and red the ink <eos> rude was their score , as suits unlettered men <eos> notched with a headsman 's axe upon a block <eos> what marvel if , when came the avenging shock <eos> ‘ twas at ë, not urania , held the pen <eos>
thou know'st how guiltless first i met thy flame <eos> when love approach 'd me under friendship 's name <eos> my fancy form 'd thee of angelic kind <eos> some emanation of the all beauteous mind <eos> those smiling eyes , attempering every ray <eos> shone sweetly lambent with celestial day <eos> guiltless i gazed ; heaven listen 'd while you sung <eos> and truths divine came mended from that tongue <eos> from lips like those , what precept fail 'd to move <eos> too soon they taught me ‘ twas no sin to love <eos> back through the paths of pleasing sense i ran <eos> nor wish 'd an angel whom i loved a man <eos> dim and remote the joys of saints i see <eos> nor envy them that heaven i lose for thee <eos>
flower of the desert , type mysterious , strange <eos> like bird or monster on some sculptured tomb <eos> in egypt 's curious fashion wrought , what change <eos> or odd similitude of fate , what range <eos> of cycling centuries from out the gloom <eos> of dusty ages has evolved thy bloom <eos> in the bleak desert of an alien zone <eos> child of the past , why dwellest thou alone <eos> grotesque , incongruous , amid the flowers <eos> unlovely and unloved , standing aside <eos> like to some rugged spirit sheathed in pride <eos> unsmiling to the sun , untouched by showers <eos> the dew falls — every bud has drunk its fill <eos> bloom of the desert , thou art arid still <eos>
‘ and then i came to seek thee in this cell <eos> to crucify my worldliness and pride <eos> to lay my heart 's affections all aside <eos> as carnal hindrances which held my soul <eos> from hasting unencumbered to her goal <eos> and all this have i done , or else have striven <eos> to do , obeying the behest of heaven <eos> and my reward is bitterness . i seem <eos> to wander always in a feverish dream <eos> on plains where there is only sun and sand <eos> no rock or tree in all the weary land <eos> my thirst unquenchable , my heart burnt dry <eos> and still in my parched throat i faintly cry <eos> deliver me , o lord : bow down thine ear <eos>
meanwhile the black ship on to scyros ran <eos> and those twain found before his palace gate <eos> achilles ’ son , now hurling dart and lance <eos> now in his chariot driving fleetfoot steeds <eos> glad were they to behold him practising <eos> the deeds of war , albeit his heart was sad <eos> for his slain sire , of whom had tidings come <eos> ere this . with reverent eyes of awe they went <eos> to meet him , for that goodly form and face <eos> seemed even as very achilles unto them <eos> but he , or ever they had spoken , cried <eos> “ all hail , ye strangers , unto this mine home <eos> say whence ye are , and who , and what the need <eos> that hither brings you over barren seas <eos>
this medieval knight ( the legend saith <eos> for months would scarcely draw a sober breath <eos> but as his appetite grew more and more <eos> drank each day worse than on the day before <eos> was drunk all night , all day continued so <eos> indulged in every vice he chanced to know <eos> but long debauch and riotous excess <eos> reduce their strongest votaries to distress <eos> when nature can the strain no longer stand <eos> she chastens with a sure and irate hand <eos> so when the day of reckoning had come <eos> she smote with fever and delirium <eos> this valiant knight whom we have tried to paint <eos> a very slim foundation for a saint <eos>
but passion ambushed by the aerial shrine <eos> comes forth to dance , a hoofed obscenity <eos> his satyr 's dance , with laughter in his eye <eos> and cruelty along the scarlet line <eos> of his bright smiling mouth . all uncontrolled <eos> love 's rebel servant , he delights to beat <eos> the maddening quick dry rhythm of goatish feet <eos> even in the sanctuary , and makes bold <eos> to mime himself the godhead of the place <eos> he turns in terror from her trance calmed face <eos> from the white lidded languor of her eyes <eos> from lips that passion never shook before <eos> but glad in the promise of her sacrifice <eos> “ i give you all ; would that i might give more <eos>
a woman 's face with nature 's own hand painted <eos> hast thou the master mistress of my passion <eos> a woman 's gentle heart but not acquainted <eos> with shifting change as is false women 's fashion <eos> an eye more bright than theirs , less false in rolling <eos> gilding the object whereupon it gazeth <eos> a man in hue all hues in his controlling <eos> which steals men 's eyes and women 's souls amazeth <eos> and for a woman wert thou first created <eos> till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting <eos> and by addition me of thee defeated <eos> by adding one thing to my purpose nothing <eos> but since she pricked thee out for women 's pleasure <eos> mine be thy love and thy love 's use their treasure <eos>
three sang of love together : one with lips <eos> crimson , with cheeks and bosom in a glow <eos> flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips <eos> and one there sang who soft and smooth as snow <eos> bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show <eos> and one was blue with famine after love <eos> who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low <eos> the burden of what those were singing of <eos> one shamed herself in love ; one temperately <eos> grew gross in soulless love , a sluggish wife <eos> one famished died for love . thus two of three <eos> took death for love and won him after strife <eos> one droned in sweetness like a fattened bee <eos> all on the threshold , yet all short of life <eos>
while yet he spoke , impatient of delay <eos> he braced his sandals on , and strode away <eos> then from the heavens the martial goddess flies <eos> through the wild fields of air , and cleaves the skies <eos> in form , a virgin in soft beauty 's bloom <eos> skill 'd in the illustrious labours of the loom <eos> alone to ithaca she stood display 'd <eos> but unapparent as a viewless shade <eos> escaped telemachus ( the powers above <eos> seen or unseen , o'er earth at pleasure move <eos> the dogs intelligent confess 'd the tread <eos> of power divine , and howling , trembling , fled <eos> the goddess , beckoning , waves her deathless hands <eos> dauntless the king before the goddess stands <eos>
swept , clean , and still , across the polished floor <eos> from some unshuttered casement , hid from sight <eos> the level sunshine slants , its greater light <eos> quenching the little lamp which pallid , poor <eos> flickering , unreplenished , at the door <eos> has striven against darkness the long night <eos> dawn fills the room , and penetrating , bright <eos> the silent sunbeams through the window pour <eos> and she lies sleeping , ignorant of fate <eos> enmeshed in listless dreams , her soul not yet <eos> ripened to bear the purport of this day <eos> the morning breeze scarce stirs the coverlet <eos> a shadow falls across the sunlight ; wait <eos> a lark is singing as he flies away <eos>
then spake king arthur to sir bedivere <eos> ‘ far other is this battle in the west <eos> whereto we move , than when we strove in youth <eos> and brake the petty kings , and fought with rome <eos> or thrust the heathen from the roman wall <eos> and shook him through the north . ill doom is mine <eos> to war against my people and my knights <eos> the king who fights his people fights himself <eos> and they my knights , who loved me once , the stroke <eos> that strikes them dead is as my death to me <eos> yet let us hence , and find or feel a way <eos> through this blind haze , which ever since i saw <eos> one lying in the dust at almesbury <eos> hath folded in the passes of the world <eos>
new yeare , forth looking out of ianus gate <eos> doth seeme to promise hope of new delight <eos> and , bidding th'old adieu , his passed date <eos> bids all old thoughts to die in dumpish * spright <eos> and calling forth out of sad winters night <eos> fresh love , that long hath slept in cheerlesse bower <eos> wils him awake , and soone about him dight <eos> his wanton wings and darts of deadly power <eos> for lusty spring now in his timely howre <eos> is ready to come forth , him to receive <eos> and warns the earth with divers colord flowre <eos> to decke hir selfe , and her faire mantle weave <eos> then you , faire flowre ! in whom fresh youth doth raine <eos> prepare your selfe new love to entertaine <eos>
once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee <eos> and was the safeguard of the west : the worth <eos> of venice did not fall below her birth <eos> venice , the eldest child of liberty <eos> she was a maiden city , bright and free <eos> no guile seduced , no force could violate <eos> and , when she took unto herself a mate <eos> she must espouse the everlasting sea <eos> and what if she had seen those glories fade <eos> those titles vanish , and that strength decay <eos> yet shall some tribute of regret be paid <eos> when her long life hath reached its final day <eos> men are we , and must grieve when even the shade <eos> of that which once was great is passed away <eos>

thou on whose stream , ‘ mid the steep sky 's commotion <eos> loose clouds like earth 's decaying leaves are shed <eos> shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean <eos> angels of rain and lightning ; there are spread <eos> on the blue surface of thine airy surge <eos> like the bright hair uplifted from the head <eos> of some fierce maenad , ev'n from the dim verge <eos> of the horizon to the zenith 's height <eos> the locks of the approaching storm . thou dirge <eos> of the dying year , to which this closing night <eos> will be the dome of a vast sepulchre <eos> vaulted with all thy congregated might <eos> of vapours , from whose solid atmosphere <eos> black rain , and fire , and hail will burst : o hear <eos>

“ the angels , o my brother ! and this clime <eos> wherein thou art , impassible and pure <eos> i call created , as indeed they are <eos> in their whole being . but the elements <eos> which thou hast nam 'd , and what of them is made <eos> are by created virtue ’ inform 'd : create <eos> their substance , and create the ’ informing virtue <eos> in these bright stars , that round them circling move <eos> the soul of every brute and of each plant <eos> the ray and motion of the sacred lights <eos> with complex potency attract and turn <eos> but this our life the ’ eternal good inspires <eos> immediate , and enamours of itself <eos> so that our wishes rest for ever here <eos>
nature made every fop to plague his brother <eos> just as one beauty mortifies another <eos> but here 's the captain that will plague them both <eos> whose air cries , arm ! whose very look 's an oath <eos> the captain 's honest , sirs , and that 's enough <eos> though his soul 's bullet , and his body buff <eos> he spits fore right ; his haughty chest before <eos> like battering rams , beats open every door <eos> and with a face as red , and as awry <eos> as herod 's hangdogs in old tapestry <eos> scarecrow to boys , the breeding woman 's curse <eos> has yet a strange ambition to look worse <eos> confounds the civil , keeps the rude in awe <eos> jests like a licensed fool , commands like law <eos>
the doors are all wide open ; at the gate <eos> the blossomed lilacs counterfeit a blaze <eos> and seem to warm the air ; a dreamy haze <eos> hangs o'er the brighton meadows like a fate <eos> and on their margin , with sea tides elate <eos> the flooded charles , as in the happier days <eos> writes the last letter of his name , and stays <eos> his restless steps , as if compelled to wait <eos> i also wait ; but they will come no more <eos> those friends of mine , whose presence satisfied <eos> the thirst and hunger of my heart . ah me <eos> they have forgotten the pathway to my door <eos> something is gone from nature since they died <eos> and summer is not summer , nor can be <eos>
they rested there that night . next morn they rose <eos> and to the ford of battle forward came <eos> that day a great , ill favoured , lowering cloud <eos> upon ferdiah 's face cuchullin saw <eos> “ badly , ” said he , “ dost thou appear this day <eos> ferdiah , for thy hair has duskier grown <eos> this day , and a dull stupour dims thine eyes <eos> and thine own face and form , and what thou wert <eos> in outward seeming have deserted thee <eos> “ ‘ tis not through fear of thee that i am so <eos> ferdiah said , “ for erin doth not hold <eos> this day a champion i could not subdue <eos> and thus betwixt the twain this speech arose <eos> and thus cuchullin mourned and he replied <eos>
at ephesus , in former times , once shone <eos> a fair , whose charms would dignify a throne <eos> and , if to publick rumour credit ‘ s due <eos> celestial bliss her husband with her knew <eos> naught else was talked of but her beauteous face <eos> and chastity that adds the highest grace <eos> from ev'ry quarter numbers flocked to see <eos> this belle , regarded as from errors free <eos> the honour of her sex , and country too <eos> as such , old mothers held her up to view <eos> and wished their offspring 's wives like her to act <eos> the sons desired the very same in fact <eos> from her , beyond a doubt , our prudes descend <eos> an ancient , celebrated house , depend <eos>
but as thou camest forth to bring the poor <eos> whose hearts are nearer faith and verity <eos> spiritual childhood , thy philosophy <eos> so taught'st the a b c of heavenly lore <eos> because thou sat'st not lonely evermore <eos> with mighty truths informing language high <eos> but , walking in thy poem continually <eos> didst utter deeds , of all true forms the core <eos> poet and poem one indivisible fact <eos> because thou didst thine own ideal act <eos> and so , for parchment , on the human soul <eos> didst write thine aspirations — at thy goal <eos> thou didst arrive with curses for acclaim <eos> and cry to god up through a cloud of shame <eos>
with simple gladness met him on the road <eos> his gray haired father — elder brother now <eos> few words were spoken , little welcome said <eos> but , as they walked , the more was understood <eos> if with a less delight he brought him home <eos> than he who met the prodigal returned <eos> it was with more reliance , with more peace <eos> for with the leaning pride that old men feel <eos> in young strong arms that draw their might from them <eos> he led him to the house . his sister there <eos> whose kisses were not many , but whose eyes <eos> were full of watchfulness and hovering love <eos> set him beside the fire in the old place <eos> and heaped the table with best country fare <eos>
lo ! the year 's final day !— nature performs <eos> its obsequies with darkness , wind , and rain <eos> but man is jocund .— hark ! th ’ exultant strain <eos> from towers and steeples drowns the wintry storms <eos> no village spire but to the cots and farms <eos> right merrily , its scant and tuneless peal <eos> rings round !— ah ! joy ungrateful !— mirth insane <eos> wherefore the senseless triumph , ye , who feel <eos> this annual portion of brief life the while <eos> depart for ever ?— brought it no dear hours <eos> of health and night rest ?— none that saw the smile <eos> on lips belov 'd ?— o ! with as gentle powers <eos> will the next pass ?— ye pause !— yet careless hear <eos> strike these last clocks , that knell th ’ expiring year <eos>
then the soul of the leper stood , up in his eyes <eos> and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he <eos> remembered in what a haughtier guise <eos> he had flung an alms to leprosie <eos> when he girt his young life up in gilded mail <eos> and set forth in search of the holy grail <eos> the heart within him was ashes and dust <eos> he parted in twain his single crust <eos> he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink <eos> and gave the leper to eat and drink <eos> ‘ t was a moldy crust of coarse brown bread <eos> ‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl <eos> yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed <eos> and ‘ t was red wine he drank with his thirsty soul <eos>
be still . the hanging gardens were a dream <eos> that over persian roses flew to kiss <eos> the curled lashes of semiramis <eos> troy never was , nor green skamander stream <eos> provence and troubadour are merest lies <eos> the glorious hair of venice was a beam <eos> made within titian 's eye . the sunsets seem <eos> the world is very old and nothing is <eos> be still . thou foolish thing , thou canst not wake <eos> nor thy tears wedge thy soldered lids apart <eos> but patter in the darkness of thy heart <eos> thy brain is plagued . thou art a frighted owl <eos> blind with the light of life thou'ldst not forsake <eos> and error loves and nourishes thy soul <eos>
no servile tenets would admittance find <eos> destructive of the rights of humankind <eos> of power divine , hereditary right <eos> and non resistance to a tyrant 's might <eos> for sure that all should thus for one be cursed <eos> is but great nature 's edict just reversed <eos> no moralists then , righteous to excess <eos> would show fair virtue in so black a dress <eos> that they , like boys , who some feigned sprite array <eos> first from the spectre fly themselves away <eos> no preachers in the terrible delight <eos> but choose to win by reason , not affright <eos> not , conjurors like , in fire and brimstone dwell <eos> and draw each moving argument from hell <eos>
upon my word , replied another fair <eos> if he were mine , i openly declare <eos> to judge from what so pleasantly you say <eos> i 'd make a present of him new year 's day <eos> for pleasure never gives me full delight <eos> unless a little pain the bliss invite <eos> no doubt your husband moves as he is led <eos> thank heav'n a different mortal claims my bed <eos> to take him in , great nicety we need <eos> but howsoe'er , at times i can succeed <eos> the satisfaction doubly then is felt <eos> in fond emotion bosoms freely melt <eos> with neither of you , husband or gallant <eos> would i exchange , though these so much you vaunt <eos>
but wherefore do not you a mightier way <eos> make war upon this bloody tyrant time <eos> and fortify your self in your decay <eos> with means more blessed than my barren rhyme <eos> now stand you on the top of happy hours <eos> and many maiden gardens yet unset <eos> with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers <eos> much liker than your painted counterfeit <eos> so should the lines of life that life repair <eos> which this ( time 's pencil ) or my pupil pen <eos> neither in inward worth nor outward fair <eos> can make you live your self in eyes of men <eos> to give away your self , keeps your self still <eos> and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill <eos>
bride of the shark , her valour first i sing <eos> who on the lone seas quickened of a king <eos> she , from the shore and puny homes of men <eos> beyond the climber ’ s sea discerning ken <eos> swam , led by omens ; and devoid of fear <eos> beheld her monstrous paramour draw near <eos> she gazed ; all round her to the heavenly pale <eos> the simple sea was void of isle or sail <eos> sole overhead the unsparing sun was reared <eos> when the deep bubbled and the brute appeared <eos> but she , secure in the decrees of fate <eos> made strong her bosom and received the mate <eos> and , men declare , from that marine embrace <eos> conceived the virtues of a stronger race <eos>
now on a bier the persian warriors place <eos> the breathless youth , and shade his pallid face <eos> and turning from that fatal field away <eos> move towards the champion 's home in long array <eos> then rustem , sick of martial pomp and show <eos> himself the spring of all this scene of woe <eos> doomed to the flames the pageantry he loved <eos> shield , spear , and mace , so oft in battle proved <eos> now lost to all , encompassed by despair <eos> his bright pavilion crackling blazed in air <eos> the sparkling throne the ascending column fed <eos> in smoking fragments fell the golden bed <eos> the raging fire red glimmering died away <eos> and all the warrior 's pride in dust and ashes lay <eos>
how darkly o'er yon far off mountain frowns <eos> the gather 'd tempest ! from that lurid cloud <eos> the deep voiced thunders roll , aweful and loud <eos> tho ’ distant ; while upon the misty downs <eos> fast falls in shadowy streaks the pelting rain <eos> i never saw so terrible a storm <eos> perhaps some way worn traveller in vain <eos> wraps his torn raiment round his shivering form <eos> cold even as hope within him ! i the while <eos> pause me in sadness tho ’ the sunbeams smile <eos> cheerily round me . ah that thus my lot <eos> might be with peace and solitude assign 'd <eos> where i might from some little quiet cot <eos> sigh for the crimes and miseries of mankind <eos>
“ shall then no more , o sire of gods ! be mine <eos> the rights and honours of a power divine <eos> scorn 'd e'en by man , and ( oh severe disgrace <eos> by soft phaeacians , my degenerate race <eos> against yon destined head in vain i swore <eos> and menaced vengeance , ere he reach 'd his shore <eos> to reach his natal shore was thy decree <eos> mild i obey 'd , for who shall war with thee <eos> behold him landed , careless and asleep <eos> from all the eluded dangers of the deep <eos> lo where he lies , amidst a shining store <eos> of brass , rich garments , and refulgent ore <eos> and bears triumphant to his native isle <eos> a prize more worth than ilion 's noble spoil <eos>

4 . if thine open hand hath relieved distress <eos> if thy pity hath sprung to wretchedness <eos> if thou hast forgiven the sore offense <eos> and humbled thy heart with penitence <eos> if nature 's voices have spoken to thee <eos> with her holy meanings eloquently <eos> if every creature hath won thy love <eos> from the creeping worm to the brooding dove <eos> if never a sad , low spoken word <eos> hath pled with thy human heart unheard <eos> then `, when the night steals on , as now <eos> it will bring relief to thine aching brow <eos> and , with joy and peace at the thought of rest <eos> thou wilt sink to sleep on thy mother 's breast <eos>

all nature seems at work . slugs leave their lair <eos> the bees are stirring — birds are on the wing <eos> and winter , slumbering in the open air <eos> wears on his smiling face a dream of spring <eos> and i the while , the sole unbusy thing <eos> nor honey make , nor pair , nor build , nor sing <eos> yet well i ken the banks where amaranths blow <eos> have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow <eos> bloom , o ye amaranths ! bloom for whom ye may <eos> for me ye bloom not ! glide , rich streams , away <eos> with lips unbrightened , wreathless brow , i stroll <eos> and would you learn the spells that drowse my soul <eos> work without hope draws nectar in a sieve <eos> and hope without an object cannot live <eos>
he said : then from the bank his javelin tore <eos> and left the breathless warrior in his gore <eos> the floating tides the bloody carcase lave <eos> and beat against it , wave succeeding wave <eos> till , roll ’ d between the banks , it lies the food <eos> of curling eels , and fishes of the flood <eos> all scatter ’ d round the stream ( their mightiest slain <eos> the amazed paeonians scour along the plain <eos> he vents his fury on the flying crew <eos> thrasius , astyplus , and mnesus slew <eos> mydon , thersilochus , with æ nius , fell <eos> and numbers more his lance had plunged to hell <eos> but from the bottom of his gulfs profound <eos> scamander spoke ; the shores return ’ d the sound <eos>
give period to my matter of complaining <eos> fair wonder of our time 's admiring eye <eos> and entertain no more thy long disdaining <eos> or give me leave at last that i may die <eos> for who can live , perpetually secluded <eos> from death to life , that loathes her discontent <eos> lest by some hope seducively deluded <eos> such thoughts aspire to fortunate event <eos> but i that now have drawn mal pleasant breath <eos> under the burden of thy cruel hate <eos> o , i must long and linger after death <eos> and yet i dare not give my life her date <eos> for if i die and thou repent t ’ have slain me <eos> ‘ twill grieve me more than if thou didst disdain me <eos>
this bronze doth keep the very form and mold <eos> of our great martyr 's face . yes , this is he <eos> that brow all wisdom , all benignity <eos> that human , humorous mouth ; those cheeks that hold <eos> like some harsh landscape all the summer 's gold <eos> that spirit fit for sorrow , as the sea <eos> for storms to beat on ; the lone agony <eos> those silent , patient lips too well foretold <eos> yes , this is he who ruled a world of men <eos> as might some prophet of the elder day <eos> brooding above the tempest and the fray <eos> with deep eyed thought and more than mortal ken <eos> a power was his beyond the touch of art <eos> or armed strength — his pure and mighty heart <eos>

in former days , just by cythera town <eos> a monastery was , of some renown <eos> with nuns the queens of beauty filled the place <eos> and gay gallants you easily might trace <eos> the courtier , citizen , and parson too <eos> the doctor and the bachelor you 'd view <eos> with eager steps :— all visits thither made <eos> and ‘ mong the latter , one ( a pleasing blade <eos> had free access : was thought a prudent friend <eos> who might to sisters many comforts lend <eos> was always closely shaved and nicely dressed <eos> and ev'ry thing he said was well expressed <eos> the breath of scandal , howsoever pat <eos> ne'er lighted on his neat cravat nor hat <eos>
the increasing moonlight drifts across my bed <eos> and on the churchyard by the road , i know <eos> it falls as white and noiselessly as snow <eos> ‘ twas such a night two weary summers fled <eos> the stars , as now , were waning overhead <eos> listen ! again the shrill lipped bugles blow <eos> where the swift currents of the river flow <eos> past fredericksburg : far off the heavens are red <eos> with sudden conflagration : on yon height <eos> linstock in hand , the gunners hold their breath <eos> a signal rocket pierces the dense night <eos> flings its spent stars upon the town beneath <eos> hark !— the artillery massing on the right <eos> hark !— the black squadrons wheeling down to death <eos>
“ o mother ida , harken ere i die <eos> still she spake on and still she spake of power <eos> ‘ which in all action is the end of all <eos> power fitted to the season ; wisdom bred <eos> and throned of wisdom — from all neighbour crowns <eos> alliance and allegiance , till thy hand <eos> fail from the sceptre staff . such boon from me <eos> from me , heaven 's queen , paris , to thee king born <eos> a shepherd all thy life but yet king born <eos> should come most welcome , seeing men , in power <eos> only , are likest gods , who have attain 'd <eos> rest in a happy place and quiet seats <eos> above the thunder , with undying bliss <eos> in knowledge of their own supremacy <eos>

“ to ride a stick , to build a paper house <eos> play odd and even , harness mouse and mouse <eos> if a grown man professed to find delight <eos> in things like these , you 'd call him mad outright <eos> “ well now , should reason force you to admit <eos> that love is just as childish , every whit <eos> to own that whimpering at your mistress ’ door <eos> is e'en as weak as building on the floor <eos> say , will you put conviction into act <eos> and , like young polemo , at once retract <eos> take off the signs and trappings of disease <eos> your leg bands , tippets , furs , and muffatees <eos> as he slipped off his chaplets , when the word <eos> of sober wisdom all his being stirred <eos>
can you , joconde , so truly cruel prove <eos> to quit my fervent love in courts to move <eos> the promises of kings are airy dreams <eos> and scarcely last beyond the day 's extremes <eos> by watchful , anxious care alone retain 'd <eos> and lost , through mere caprice , as soon as gain 'd <eos> if weary of my charms , alas ! you feel <eos> still think , my love , what joys these woods conceal <eos> here dwell around tranquillity and ease <eos> the streams ’ soft murmurs , and the balmy breeze <eos> invite to sleep ; these vales where breathe the doves <eos> all , all , my dear joconde , renew our loves <eos> you laugh !— ah ! cruel , go , expose thy charms <eos> grim death will quickly spare me these alarms <eos>
‘ twas silence all . at last aegyptius spoke <eos> aegyptius , by his age and sorrow broke <eos> a length of days his soul with prudence crown 'd <eos> a length of days had bent him to the ground <eos> his eldest hope in arms to ilion came <eos> by great ulysses taught the path to fame <eos> but ( hapless youth ) the hideous cyclops tore <eos> his quivering limbs , and quaff 'd his spouting gore <eos> three sons remain 'd ; to climb with haughty fires <eos> the royal bed , eurynomus aspires <eos> the rest with duteous love his griefs assuage <eos> and ease the sire of half the cares of age <eos> yet still his antiphus he loves , he mourns <eos> and , as he stood , he spoke and wept by turns <eos>

though of the jews she merit most esteem <eos> yet here the christian has the greater theme <eos> her martial song describes how sis'ra fell <eos> this sings our triumph over death and hell <eos> the rising light employ 'd the sacred breath <eos> of the blest virgin and elizabeth <eos> in songs of joy the angels sung his birth <eos> here how he treated was upon the earth <eos> trembling we read ! th'affliction and the scorn <eos> which for our guilt so patiently was borne <eos> conception , birth , and suff'ring , all belong <eos> ( though various parts ) to one celestial song <eos> and she , well using so divine an art <eos> has in this concert sung the tragic part <eos>
love was laid down , all weary fast asleep <eos> whereas my love his armor took away <eos> the boy awaked , and straight began to weep <eos> but stood amazed , and knew not what to say <eos> “ weep not , my boy , ” said venus to her son <eos> “ thy weapons none can wield , but thou alone <eos> licia the fair , this harm to thee hath done <eos> i saw her here , and presently was gone <eos> she will restore them , for she hath no need <eos> to take thy weapons where thy valour lies <eos> for men to wound the fates have her decreed <eos> with favour , hands , with beauty , and with eyes <eos> no , venus , no : she scorns them , credit me <eos> but robbed thy son that none might care for thee <eos>
the little man with the vague beard and guise <eos> pulled at the wicket . “ come inside ! ” he said <eos> “ i 'll show you all we 've got now — it was size <eos> you wanted ? — oh , dry colors ! well ” — he led <eos> to a dim alley lined with musty bins <eos> and pulled one fiercely . violent and bold <eos> a sudden tempest of mad , shrieking sins <eos> scarlet screamed out above the battered gold <eos> of tins and picture frames . i held my breath <eos> he tugged another hard — and sapphire skies <eos> spread in vast quietude , serene as death <eos> o'er waves like crackled turquoise — and my eyes <eos> burnt with the blinding brilliance of calm sea <eos> “ we 're selling that lot there out cheap ! ” said he <eos>
i traverse oft in thought the battle plain <eos> of my past life , ‘ mid many a shatter 'd dream <eos> of pleasure , and of hope , which youth in vain <eos> based on the shifting sands of time 's swift stream <eos> fond bulwarks ‘ gainst the strong assaults of pain <eos> and ‘ mid their ruins , like an exiled man <eos> gazing on scenes where he can dwell no more <eos> i stand and mourn their sweet enchantment o'er <eos> where both life 's pleasures and its cares began <eos> earth crumbles ‘ neath our feet as we walk on <eos> and leaves a gulf behind none can retrace <eos> its pleasures flash a moment and are gone <eos> but if we treasure in our soul love 's grace <eos> that will refresh and gladden all our race <eos>
so take these kindly , even though there be <eos> some notes that unto other lyres belong <eos> stray echoes from the elder sons of song <eos> and think how from its neighbouring native sea <eos> the pensive shell doth borrow melody <eos> i would not do the lordly masters wrong <eos> by filching fair words from the shining throng <eos> whose music haunts me as the wind a tree <eos> lo , when a stranger in soft syrian glooms <eos> shot through with sunset treads the cedar dells <eos> and hears the breezy ring of elfin bells <eos> far down by where the white haired cataract booms <eos> he , faint with sweetness caught from forest smells <eos> bears thence , unwitting , plunder of perfumes <eos>
beyond the low marsh meadows and the beach <eos> seen through the hoary trunks of windy pines <eos> the long blue level of the ocean shines <eos> the distant surf , with hoarse , complaining speech <eos> out from its sandy barrier seems to reach <eos> and while the sun behind the woods declines <eos> the moaning sea with sighing boughs combines <eos> and waves and pines make answer , each to each <eos> o melancholy soul , whom far and near <eos> in life , faith , hope , the same sad undertone <eos> pursues from thought to thought ! thou needs must hear <eos> an old refrain , too much , too long thine own <eos> ‘ tis thy mortality infects thine ear <eos> the mournful strain was in thyself alone <eos>
like this , is ours ; this night we ventur 'd out <eos> on juv'nile wing , appall 'd by many a doubt <eos> cheer 'd by your sanction , every peril o'er <eos> with joy we hail this welcome , friendly shore <eos> our little band , ambitious now to raise <eos> a pleasing off'ring for your wreath of praise <eos> on them bestow 'd , depute me here to tell <eos> the lively feelings that their bosoms swell <eos> for your indulgent and parental part <eos> they feel the triumph of a grateful heart <eos> that , each revolving year shall truly prove <eos> how much they honor , how sincere they love <eos> and for your fostering care will make return <eos> by filial duty , and desire to learn <eos>
well , this being so , and we who know it being <eos> so curious about those well locked houses <eos> the minds of those we know ,— to enter softly <eos> and steal from floor to floor up shadowy stairways <eos> from room to quiet room , from wall to wall <eos> breathing deliberately the very air <eos> pressing our hands and nerves against warm darkness <eos> to learn what ghosts are there <eos> suppose for once i set my doors wide open <eos> and bid you in . . . . suppose i try to tell you <eos> the secrets of this house , and how i live here <eos> suppose i tell you who i am , in fact <eos> deceiving you — as far as i may know it <eos> only so much as i deceive myself <eos>
if cross 'd with all mishaps be my poor life <eos> if one short day i never spent in mirth <eos> if my sp'rit with itself holds lasting strife <eos> if sorrow 's death is but new sorrow 's birth <eos> if this vain world be but a mournful stage <eos> where slave born man plays to the scoffing stars <eos> if youth be toss 'd with love , with weakness age <eos> if knowledge serves to hold our thoughts in wars <eos> if time can close the hundred mouths of fame <eos> and make what 's long since past , like that 's to be <eos> if virtue only be an idle name <eos> if being born i was but born to die <eos> why seek i to prolong these loathsome days <eos> the fairest rose in shortest time decays <eos>
when i was still a boy and mother 's pride <eos> a bigger boy spoke up to me so kind like <eos> ‘ if you do like , i 'll treat you with a ride <eos> in this wheel barrow . ’ so then i was blind like <eos> to what he had a working in his mind like <eos> and mounted for a passenger inside <eos> and coming to a puddle , pretty wide <eos> he tipp 'd me in a grinning back behind like <eos> so when a man may come to me so thick like <eos> and shake my hand where once he pass 'd me by <eos> and tell me he would do me this or that <eos> i can n't help thinking of the big boy 's trick like <eos> and then , for all i can but wag my hat <eos> and thank him , i do feel a little shy <eos>
while nature broods o'er the soft repose <eos> of the dewy mead , and the half shut rose <eos> does not that lovely hour give birth <eos> to thoughts more allied to heaven than earth <eos> when things that have been in perspective pass <eos> like the sun 's last rays over memory 's glass <eos> when life 's cares are forgot , when its joys are our own <eos> and the mild beams of faith round the future are thrown <eos> when all that awakened remorse or regret <eos> like a stormy morn , has in splendour set <eos> when the sorrows of time and the hopes of heaven <eos> blend in the soul like the hues of even <eos> and the spirit looks back on this troubled scene <eos> with a glance as bright as it ne'er had been <eos>
this congreve follows in his deathless line <eos> and the tenth hand is put to the design <eos> the happy boldness of his finish 'd toil <eos> claims more than shakespear 's wit , or johnson 's oil <eos> sing on , harmonious swan , in weeping strains <eos> and tell pastora 's death to mournful swains <eos> or with more pleasing charms , with softer airs <eos> sweeten our passions , and delude our cares <eos> or let thy satyr grin with half a smile <eos> and jeer in easy etherege 's style <eos> let manly wycherly chalk out the way <eos> and art direct , where nature goes astray <eos> ‘ tis not for thee to write of conqu'ring kings <eos> the noise of arms will break thy am'rous strings <eos>
is not thy mother 's rede at one with theirs <eos> who cry “ the work is done ” ? what though to thee <eos> thee only , should the utterance shape itself <eos> “ o to forget , and to begin again <eos> only of thee be heard as that keen cry <eos> rending its way from some distracted heart <eos> that yields it and so breaks ? yet list the cry <eos> begin for her again , and learn to sing <eos> but first , in all thy learning learn to be <eos> is life a field ? then plough it up — re sow <eos> with worthier seed — is life a ship ? o heed <eos> the southing of thy stars — is life a breath <eos> breathe deeper , draw life up from hour to hour <eos> aye , from the deepest deep in thy deep soul <eos>
and yet i fear lest men who read these lines <eos> should judge of them as if they wholly spake <eos> the love i bear thee and thy holy sake <eos> saying : “ he doth the high name wrong who twines <eos> earth 's highest aim with him , and thus combines <eos> jesus and art . ” but i my refuge make <eos> in what the word said : “ man his life shall take <eos> from every word : ” in art god first designs <eos> he spoke the word . and let me humbly speak <eos> my faith , that art is nothing to the act <eos> lowliest , that to the truth bears witness meek <eos> renownless , even unknown , but yet a fact <eos> the glory of thy childhood and thy youth <eos> was not that thou didst show , but didst the truth <eos>
in plays like these i would not deal alone <eos> in words and phrases trite and too well known <eos> nor , stooping from the tragic height , drop down <eos> to the low level of buffoon and clown <eos> as though pert davus , or the saucy jade <eos> who sacks the gold and jeers the gull she made <eos> were like silenus , who , though quaint and odd <eos> is yet the guide and tutor of a god <eos> a hackneyed subject i would take and treat <eos> so deftly , all should hope to do the feat <eos> then , having strained and struggled , should concede <eos> to do the feat were difficult indeed <eos> so much may order and arrangement do <eos> to make the cheap seem choice , the threadbare new <eos>
and now the youthful , gay , capricious spring <eos> piercing her showery clouds with crystal light <eos> and with their hues reflected streaking bright <eos> her radiant bow , bids all her warblers sing <eos> the lark , shrill caroling on soaring wing <eos> the lonely thrush , in brake , with blossoms white <eos> that tunes his pipe so loud ; while , from the sight <eos> coy bending their dropt heads , young cowslips fling <eos> rich perfume o'er the fields .— it is the prime <eos> of hours that beauty robes :— yet all they gild <eos> cheer , and delight in this their fragrant time <eos> for thy dear sake , to me less pleasure yield <eos> than , veil 'd in sleet , and rain , and hoary rime <eos> dim winter 's naked hedge and plashy field <eos>
“ perverse mankind ! whose wills , created free <eos> charge all their woes on absolute degree <eos> all to the dooming gods their guilt translate <eos> and follies are miscall 'd the crimes of fate <eos> when to his lust aegysthus gave the rein <eos> did fate , or we , the adulterous act constrain <eos> did fate , or we , when great atrides died <eos> urge the bold traitor to the regicide <eos> hermes i sent , while yet his soul remain 'd <eos> sincere from royal blood , and faith profaned <eos> to warn the wretch , that young orestes , grown <eos> to manly years , should re assert the throne <eos> yet , impotent of mind , and uncontroll 'd <eos> he plunged into the gulf which heaven foretold <eos>
whoever thinks a faultless piece to see <eos> thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be <eos> in every work regard the writer 's end <eos> since none can compass more than they intend <eos> and if the means be just , the conduct true <eos> applause , in spite of trivial faults , is due <eos> as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit <eos> to avoid great errors , must the less commit <eos> neglect the rules each verbal critic lays <eos> for not to know some trifles is a praise <eos> most critics , fond of some subservient art <eos> still make the whole depend upon a part <eos> they talk of principles , but notions prize <eos> and all to one loved folly sacrifice <eos>
and atm â spoke , with love and wonder bold <eos> “ tread i the valley where the fadeless vine <eos> drops dew immortal and sweet spices grow <eos> from fragrant roots which in that blessed mould <eos> watered by tears of penitential woe <eos> drank deep of primal peace and balm divine <eos> when in the morn of time the tale was told <eos> of forfeit happiness and ruined shrine <eos> tell me , o beauteous spirit of the bower <eos> is it thy gentle task when others sleep <eos> to guard all that a fallen world may keep <eos> of pristine bliss and lost felicities <eos> the fragrant memory of a purer hour <eos> the healing aroma of paradise <eos>

where are the others ? voices from the deep <eos> caverns of darkness answer me : “ they sleep <eos> i name no names ; instinctively i feel <eos> each at some well remembered grave will kneel <eos> and from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss <eos> for every heart best knoweth its own loss <eos> i see their scattered gravestones gleaming white <eos> through the pale dusk of the impending night <eos> o'er all alike the impartial sunset throws <eos> its golden lilies mingled with the rose <eos> we give to each a tender thought , and pass <eos> out of the graveyards with their tangled grass <eos> unto these scenes frequented by our feet <eos> when we were young , and life was fresh and sweet <eos>

thus having said , the hero bound his brows <eos> with leafy branches , then perform 'd his vows <eos> adoring first the genius of the place <eos> then earth , the mother of the heav'nly race <eos> the nymphs , and native godheads yet unknown <eos> and night , and all the stars that gild her sable throne <eos> and ancient cybel , and idaean jove <eos> and last his sire below , and mother queen above <eos> then heav'n ' s high monarch thunder 'd thrice aloud <eos> and thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud <eos> soon thro ’ the joyful camp a rumor flew <eos> the time was come their city to renew <eos> then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown 'd <eos> the feasts are doubled , and the bowls go round <eos>
oh , beauty , passing beauty ! sweetest sweet <eos> how canst thou let me waste my youth in sighs <eos> i only ask to sit beside thy feet <eos> thou knowest i dare not look into thine eyes <eos> might i but kiss thy hand ! i dare not fold <eos> my arms about thee — scarcely dare to speak <eos> and nothing seems to me so wild and bold <eos> as with one kiss to touch thy bless è d cheek <eos> methinks if i should kiss thee , no control <eos> within the thrilling brain could keep afloat <eos> the subtle spirit . even while i spoke <eos> the bare word kiss hath made my inner soul <eos> to tremble like a lutestring , ere the note <eos> hath melted in the silence that it broke <eos>
more yet and more , and yet we mark not all <eos> the warning fain to bid fair women heed <eos> its hard brief note of deadly doom and deed <eos> the verse that strewed too thick with flowers the hall <eos> whence nero watched his fiery festival <eos> that iron page wherein men 's eyes who read <eos> see , bruised and marred between two babes that bleed <eos> a mad red handed husband 's martyr fall <eos> the scene which crossed and streaked with mirth the strife <eos> of henry with his sons and witchlike wife <eos> and that sweet pageant of the kindly fiend <eos> who , seeing three friends in spirit and heart made one <eos> crowned with good hap the true love wiles he screened <eos> in the pleached lanes of pleasant edmonton <eos>
much have i travelled in the realms of gold <eos> and many goodly states and kingdoms seen <eos> round many western islands have i been <eos> which bards in fealty to apollo hold <eos> oft of one wide expanse had i been told <eos> that deep browed homer ruled as his demesne <eos> yet did i never breathe its pure serene <eos> till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold <eos> then felt i like some watcher of the skies <eos> when a new planet swims into his ken <eos> or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes <eos> he stared at the pacific — and all his men <eos> looked at each other with a wild surmise <eos> silent , upon a peak in darien <eos>
yes , thou shalt smile again !— time always heals <eos> in youth , the wounds of sorrow .— o ! survey <eos> yon now subsided deep , thro ’ night a prey <eos> to warring winds , and to their furious peals <eos> surging tumultuous !— yet , as in dismay <eos> the settling billows tremble .— morning steals <eos> grey on the rocks ;— and soon , to pour the day <eos> from the streak 'd east , the radiant orb unveils <eos> in all his pride of light .— thus shall the glow <eos> of beauty , health , and hope , by soft degrees <eos> spread o'er thy breast ; disperse these storms of woe <eos> wake , with sweet pleasure 's sense , the wish to please <eos> till from those eyes the wonted lustres flow <eos> bright as the sun on calm 'd and crystal seas <eos>
beneath the thorn was good sir ambrose found <eos> his guests an ample crescent form 'd around <eos> nature 's own carpet spread the space between <eos> where blithe domestics plied in gold and green <eos> the venerable chaplain waved his wand <eos> and silence follow 'd as he stretch 'd his hand <eos> and with a trembling voice , and heart sincere <eos> implored a blessing on th ’ abundant cheer <eos> down sat the mingling throng , and shared a feast <eos> with hearty welcomes given , by love increased <eos> a patriarch family , a close link 'd band <eos> true to their rural chieftain , heart and hand <eos> the deep carouse can never boast the bliss <eos> the animation of a scene like this <eos>
highmindedness , a jealousy for good <eos> a loving kindness for the great man 's fame <eos> dwells here and there with people of no name <eos> in noisome alley , and in pathless wood <eos> and where we think the truth least understood <eos> oft may be found a “ singleness of aim <eos> that ought to frighten into hooded shame <eos> a money mong'ring , pitiable brood <eos> how glorious this affection for the cause <eos> of stedfast genius , toiling gallantly <eos> what when a stout unbending champion awes <eos> envy , and malice to their native sty <eos> unnumber 'd souls breathe out a still applause <eos> proud to behold him in his country 's eye <eos>
i ask not for those thoughts , that sudden leap <eos> from being 's sea , like the isle seeming kraken <eos> with whose great rise the ocean all is shaken <eos> and a heart tremble quivers through the deep <eos> give me that growth which some perchance deem sleep <eos> wherewith the steadfast coral stems uprise <eos> which , by the toil of gathering energies <eos> their upward way into clear sunshine keep <eos> until , by heaven 's sweetest influences <eos> slowly and slowly spreads a speck of green <eos> into a pleasant island in the seas <eos> where , mid fall palms , the cane roofed home is seen <eos> and wearied men shall sit at sunset 's hour <eos> hearing the leaves and loving god 's dear power <eos>
“ this circuit , ” said my teacher , “ knots the scourge <eos> for envy , and the cords are therefore drawn <eos> by charity 's correcting hand . the curb <eos> is of a harsher sound , as thou shalt hear <eos> ( if i deem rightly ) , ere thou reach the pass <eos> where pardon sets them free . but fix thine eyes <eos> intently through the air , and thou shalt see <eos> a multitude before thee seated , each <eos> along the shelving grot . ” then more than erst <eos> i op 'd my eyes , before me view 'd , and saw <eos> shadows with garments dark as was the rock <eos> and when we pass 'd a little forth , i heard <eos> a crying , “ blessed mary ! pray for us <eos> michael and peter ! all ye saintly host <eos>
where coral reefs gnaw with white cruel teeth <eos> the yellow surf , and the torn billows seethe <eos> when shines the southern cross o ’ er placid isles <eos> the afric mother sits , and singing , smiles <eos> unheeding that a dead world ’ s hidden pain <eos> beats wildly rhythmic through her pure refrain <eos> and lingers softly still an echoed sigh <eos> low in earth ’ s cradle song — sweet lullaby <eos> a warning song of doom — a song of woe <eos> of terror wild , she sings , down bending low <eos> the while bright gleams the starry cross above <eos> yet tells to her no tale of tender love <eos> of him who lifteth after time a cross <eos> that healeth all the wide world ’ s sin and loss <eos>
when satisfied the smart gallant appeared <eos> and anxiously to putting off adhered <eos> pretending that the wind and tide would fail <eos> the galleys sometimes were unfit to sail <eos> repairs required ; then further heard the news <eos> that certain pirates had unpleasant views <eos> to fall upon the escort they 'd contrived <eos> at length , a pirate suddenly arrived <eos> surprized the party left upon the shore <eos> destroyed the whole ; then sought the house for more <eos> and scaled the walls while darkness spread around <eos> the pirate was grifonio 's second found <eos> who , in a trice , the noble mansion took <eos> and joy gave place to grief in ev'ry look <eos>
thus having said , the father of the fires <eos> to the black labours of his forge retires <eos> soon as he bade them blow , the bellows turn ’ d <eos> their iron mouths ; and where the furnace burn ’ d <eos> resounding breathed : at once the blast expires <eos> and twenty forges catch at once the fires <eos> just as the god directs , now loud , now low <eos> they raise a tempest , or they gently blow <eos> in hissing flames huge silver bars are roll ’ d <eos> and stubborn brass , and tin , and solid gold <eos> before , deep fix ’ d , the eternal anvils stand <eos> the ponderous hammer loads his better hand <eos> his left with tongs turns the vex ’ d metal round <eos> and thick , strong strokes , the doubling vaults rebound <eos>
a sudden horror all the assembly shook <eos> when slowly rising , halitherses spoke <eos> ( reverend and wise , whose comprehensive view <eos> at once the present and the future knew <eos> “ me too , ye fathers , hear ! from you proceed <eos> the ills ye mourn ; your own the guilty deed <eos> ye gave your sons , your lawless sons , the rein <eos> ( oft warn 'd by mentor and myself in vain <eos> an absent hero 's bed they sought to soil <eos> an absent hero 's wealth they made their spoil <eos> immoderate riot , and intemperate lust <eos> the offence was great , the punishment was just <eos> weigh then my counsels in an equal scale <eos> nor rush to ruin . justice will prevail <eos>
robert of sicily , brother of pope urbane <eos> and valmond , emperor of allemaine <eos> despoiled of his magnificent attire <eos> bare headed , breathless , and besprent with mire <eos> with sense of wrong and outrage desperate <eos> strode on and thundered at the palace gate <eos> rushed through the court yard , thrusting in his rage <eos> to right and left each seneschal and page <eos> and hurried up the broad and sounding stair <eos> his white face ghastly in the torches ’ glare <eos> from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed <eos> voices and cries he heard , but did not heed <eos> until at last he reached the banquet room <eos> blazing with light , and breathing with perfume <eos>
the simple service reached at last its close <eos> when the sick brother to some hearers goes <eos> to learn their welfare , and his own impart <eos> with strongest tokens of a friendly heart <eos> those persons were both english — man and wife <eos> who knew , for years , the toils of bush farm life <eos> to them was introduced the new made preacher <eos> just then mistaken for an older teacher <eos> due explanations made , they him invite <eos> to call and see them , and stay over night <eos> he , nothing loath , the invitation kind <eos> at once accepted , with delighted mind <eos> the two return , and with their brethren meet <eos> to join in worship — simple , pure and sweet <eos>
and then with her round , brown arms she pressed <eos> his phantom form to her throbbing breast <eos> and whispered the name , in her happy sleep <eos> of her h ó h è hunter so fair and far <eos> and then she saw in her dreams the deep <eos> where the spirit wailed , and a falling star <eos> then stealthily crouching under the trees <eos> by the light of the moon , the kan é ti dan <eos> the little , wizened , mysterious man <eos> with his long locks tossed by the moaning breeze <eos> then a flap of wings , like a thunder bird <eos> and a wailing spirit the sleeper heard <eos> and lo , through the mists of the moon , she saw <eos> the hateful visage of h â rpstin à. <eos>
happy in sleep , waking content to languish <eos> embracing clouds by night , in daytime mourn <eos> my joys but shadows , touch of truth my anguish <eos> griefs ever springing , comforts never born <eos> and still expecting when she will relent <eos> grown hoarse with crying , “ mercy , mercy give <eos> so many vows and prayers having spent <eos> that weary of my life i loathe to live <eos> and yet the hydra of my cares renews <eos> still new born sorrows of her fresh disdain <eos> and still my hope the summer winds pursues <eos> finding no end nor period of my pain <eos> this is my state , my griefs do touch so nearly <eos> and thus i live because i love her dearly <eos>
“ behold an action , gods ! that claims your care <eos> lo great æ neas rushing to the war <eos> against pelides he directs his course <eos> phoebus impels , and phoebus gives him force <eos> restrain his bold career ; at least , to attend <eos> our favour ’ d hero , let some power descend <eos> to guard his life , and add to his renown <eos> we , the great armament of heaven , came down <eos> hereafter let him fall , as fates design <eos> that spun so short his life ’ s illustrious line <eos> but lest some adverse god now cross his way <eos> give him to know what powers assist this day <eos> for how shall mortal stand the dire alarms <eos> when heaven ’ s refulgent host appear in arms <eos>
is it indeed so ? if i lay here dead <eos> wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine <eos> and would the sun for thee more coldly shine <eos> because of grave damps falling round my head <eos> i marvelled , my beloved , when i read <eos> thy thought so in the letter . i am thine <eos> but . . . so much to thee ? can i pour thy wine <eos> while my hands tremble ? then my soul , instead <eos> of dreams of death , resumes life 's lower range <eos> then , love me , love ! look on me — breathe on me <eos> as brighter ladies do not count it strange <eos> for love , to give up acres and degree <eos> i yield the grave for thy sake , and exchange <eos> my near sweet view of heaven , for earth with thee <eos>
why should i sing in verse ? why should i frame <eos> these sad neglected notes for her dear sake <eos> why should i offer up unto her name <eos> the sweetest sacrifice my youth can make <eos> why should i strive to make her live for ever <eos> that never deigns to give me joy to live <eos> why should m'afflicted muse so much endeavour <eos> such honour unto cruelty to give <eos> if her defects have purchased her this fame <eos> what should her virtues do , her smiles , her love <eos> if this her worst , how should her best inflame <eos> what passions would her milder favours move <eos> favours , i think , would sense quite overcome <eos> and that makes happy lovers ever dumb <eos>
now comes the bonny may , dancing and skipping <eos> across the stepping stones of meadow streams <eos> bearing no kin to april showers a weeping <eos> but constant sunshine as her servant seems <eos> her heart is up — her sweetness , all a maying <eos> streams in her face , like gems on beauty 's breast <eos> the swains are sighing all , and well a daying <eos> lovesick and gazing on their lovely guest <eos> the sunday paths , to pleasant places leading <eos> are graced by couples linking arm in arm <eos> sweet smiles enjoying or some book a reading <eos> where love and beauty are the constant charm <eos> for while the bonny may is dancing by <eos> beauty delights the ear , and beauty fills the eye <eos>
loud blew the north thro ’ april 's pallid days <eos> nor grass the field , nor leaves the grove obtains <eos> nor crystal sun beams , nor the gilded rains <eos> that bless the hours of promise , gently raise <eos> warmth in the blood , without that fiery blaze <eos> which makes it boil along the throbbing veins <eos> albion , displeas 'd , her own lov 'd spring surveys <eos> passing , with volant step , o'er russet plains <eos> sees her to summer 's fierce embraces speed <eos> pale , and unrobed .— faithless ! thou well may'st hide <eos> close in his sultry breast thy recreant head <eos> that did'st , neglecting thy distinguish 'd isle <eos> in winter 's icy arms so long abide <eos> while britain vainly languish 'd for thy smile <eos>
i hated thee , fallen tyrant ! i did groan <eos> to think that a most unambitious slave <eos> like thou , shouldst dance and revel on the grave <eos> of liberty . thou mightst have built thy throne <eos> where it had stood even now : thou didst prefer <eos> a frail and bloody pomp which time has swept <eos> in fragments towards oblivion . massacre <eos> for this i prayed , would on thy sleep have crept <eos> treason and slavery , rapine , fear , and lust <eos> and stifled thee , their minister . i know <eos> too late , since thou and france are in the dust <eos> that virtue owns a more eternal foe <eos> than force or fraud : old custom , legal crime <eos> and bloody faith the foulest birth of time <eos>
my tears are true . though others be divine <eos> and sing of wars and troy 's new rising frame <eos> meeting heroic feet in every line <eos> that tread high measures in the scene of fame <eos> and i , though disaccustoming my muse <eos> and sing but low songs in an humble vein <eos> may one day raise my style as others use <eos> and turn elizon to a higher strain <eos> when re intombing from oblivious ages <eos> in better stanzas her surviving wonder <eos> i may opposed against the monster rage <eos> that part desert and excellence asunder <eos> that she though coy may yet survive to see <eos> her beauty 's wonder lives again in me <eos>
at last arrived that most important day <eos> when they from all must tear themselves away <eos> and feel , what emigrants had felt before <eos> that parting scenes to tender hearts are sore <eos> their christian brethren did them all commend <eos> to their kind father , savior , guide and friend <eos> and gave to them , as pledge of their regard <eos> a bagster 's bible — god 's own precious word <eos> their kind , deep feelings , other friends displayed <eos> by various gifts , till parting time delayed <eos> and these love tokens sensibly affect <eos> the emigrants , as proof of their respect <eos> and often , when they view them even now <eos> a shade might seem to cross each thoughtful brow <eos>
i wrote my sighs , and sent them to my love <eos> i praised that fair that none enough could praise <eos> but plaints nor praises could fair licia move <eos> above my reach she did her virtues raise <eos> and thus replied : “ false scrawl , untrue thou art <eos> to feign those sighs that nowhere can be found <eos> for half those praises came not from his heart <eos> whose faith and love as yet was never found <eos> thy master 's life , false scrawl shall be thy doom <eos> because he burns , i judge thee to the flame <eos> both your attempts deserve no better room <eos> thus at her word we ashes both became <eos> believe me , fair , and let my paper live <eos> or be not fair , and so me freedom give <eos>
if faithful souls be alike glorified <eos> as angels , then my father 's soul doth see <eos> and adds this even to full felicity <eos> that valiantly i hell 's wide mouth o'erstride <eos> but if our minds to these souls be descried <eos> by circumstances and by signs that be <eos> apparent in us not immediately <eos> how shall my mind 's white truth by them be tried <eos> they see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn <eos> and style blasphemous conjurors to call <eos> on jesus ’ name , and pharisaical <eos> dissemblers feign devotion . then turn <eos> o pensive soul ! to god , for he knows best <eos> thy grief , for he put it into my breast <eos>
amazed at what the lordly devil said <eos> the clod could naught reply , so great his dread <eos> but at the gasconade perretta smiled <eos> who kept his house and weary hours beguiled <eos> a sprightly clever lass , with prying eye <eos> who , when a shepherdess , could more descry <eos> than sheep or lambs she watched upon the plain <eos> if other views or points she sought to gain <eos> said she , weep not , i 'll undertake at ease <eos> to gull this novice devil as i please <eos> he 's young and ignorant ; has nothing seen <eos> thee ; from his rage , i thoroughly will skreen <eos> my little finger , if i like can show <eos> more malice than his head and body know <eos>
some foreign writers , some our own despise <eos> the ancients only , or the moderns prize <eos> thus wit , like faith , by each man is apply 'd <eos> to one small sect , and all are damn 'd beside <eos> meanly they seek the blessing to confine <eos> and force that sun but on a part to shine <eos> which not alone the southern wit sublimes <eos> but ripens spirits in cold northern climes <eos> which from the first has shone on ages past <eos> enlights the present , and shall warm the last <eos> tho ’ each may feel increases and decays <eos> and see now clearer and now darker days <eos> regard not then if wit be old or new <eos> but blame the false , and value still the true <eos>
a ladder , which my ken pursued in vain <eos> so lofty was the summit ; down whose steps <eos> i saw the splendours in such multitude <eos> descending , ev'ry light in heav'n , methought <eos> was shed thence . as the rooks , at dawn of day <eos> bestirring them to dry their feathers chill <eos> some speed their way a field , and homeward some <eos> returning , cross their flight , while some abide <eos> and wheel around their airy lodge ; so seem 'd <eos> that glitterance , wafted on alternate wing <eos> as upon certain stair it met , and clash 'd <eos> its shining . and one ling'ring near us , wax 'd <eos> so bright , that in my thought : said : “ the love <eos> which this betokens me , admits no doubt <eos>
‘ oh , monstrous slander on the human race <eos> then read conviction in ortuno 's case <eos> by nature fashion 'd in her happiest mood <eos> with learning , fancy , keenest wit endued <eos> to what high purpose , what exalted end <eos> these lofty gifts did great ortuno bend <eos> with grateful triumph did ortuno raise <eos> the mighty trophies to their author 's praise <eos> with skill deducing from th ’ harmonious whole <eos> immortal proofs of one creative soul <eos> ah , no ! infatuate with the dazzling light <eos> in them he saw their own creative might <eos> nay , madly deem 'd , if such their wond'rous skill <eos> the phantom of a god ‘ twas theirs to will <eos>
the time has been when nature 's simple face <eos> perennial youth possessed and winning grace <eos> but who shall dare , in this refining age <eos> with nature 's praise to soil his snowy page <eos> what polish 'd lover , unappall 'd by sneers <eos> dare court a beldame of six thousand years <eos> when every clown with microscopick eyes <eos> the gaping furrows on her forehead spies <eos> ‘ good sir , your pardon : in her naked state <eos> her withered form we cannot chuse but hate <eos> but fashion 's art the waste of time repairs <eos> each wrinkle fills , and dies her silver hairs <eos> thus wrought anew , our gentle bosoms low <eos> we cannot chuse but love what 's comme il fauts <eos>
in silence and as though expectantly <eos> she crouches at his feet , while he caresses <eos> his light drawn fingers with the touch of tresses <eos> sleeked round her head , close banded lustrously <eos> save where at nape and temple the smooth brown <eos> sleaves out into a pale transparent mist <eos> of hair and tangled light . so to exist <eos> poised ‘ twixt the deep of thought where spirits drown <eos> life in a void impalpable nothingness <eos> and , on the other side , the pain and stress <eos> of clamorous action and the gnawing fire <eos> of will , focal upon a point of earth — even thus <eos> to sit , eternally without desire <eos> and yet self known , were happiness for us <eos>
man 's heart may change , but nature 's glory never <eos> though to the sullen gaze of grief the sight <eos> of sun illumined skies may seem less bright <eos> or gathering clouds less grand , yet she , as ever <eos> is lovely or majestic . though fate sever <eos> the long linked bands of love , and all delight <eos> be lost , as in a sudden starless night <eos> the radiance may return , if he , the giver <eos> of peace on earth , vouchsafe the storm to still <eos> this breast once shaken with the strife of care <eos> is touched with silent joy . the cot — the hill <eos> beyond the broad blue wave — and faces fair <eos> are pictured in my dreams , yet scenes that fill <eos> my waking eye can save me from despair <eos>
of all the kings that ever here did reign <eos> edward named fourth as first in praise i name <eos> not for his fair outside , nor well lined brain <eos> although less gifts imp feathers oft on fame <eos> nor that he could , young wise , wise valiant , frame <eos> his sire 's revenge , join 'd with a kingdom 's gain <eos> and , gain 'd by mars , could yet mad mars so tame <eos> that balance weigh 'd what sword did late obtain <eos> nor that he made the flower de luce so ‘ fraid <eos> though strongly hedged of bloody lion 's paws <eos> that witty lewis to him a tribute paid <eos> nor this , nor that , nor any such small cause <eos> but only for this worthy knight durst prove <eos> to lose his crown , rather than fail his love <eos>
fly low , dear love , thy sun dost thou not see <eos> take heed , do not so near his rays aspire <eos> lest , for thy pride , inflamed with wreakful ire <eos> it burn thy wings , as it hath burn è d me <eos> thou haply sayst thy wings immortal be <eos> and so cannot consum è d be with fire <eos> and one is hope , the other is desire <eos> and that the heavens bestowed them both on thee <eos> a muse 's words made thee with hope to fly <eos> an angel 's face desire hath begot <eos> thyself engendered by a goddess ’ eye <eos> yet for all this , immortal thou art not <eos> of heavenly eye though thou begotten art <eos> yet art thou born but of a mortal heart <eos>
prodigious this ! the frail one of our play <eos> from her own sex should mercy find to day <eos> you might have held the pretty head aside <eos> peep 'd in your fans , been serious thus , and cried <eos> ‘ the play may pass — but that strange creature , shore <eos> i can n't — indeed now — i so hate a whore <eos> just as a blockhead rubs his thoughtless skull <eos> and thanks his stars he was not born a fool <eos> so from a sister sinner you shall hear <eos> ‘ how strangely you expose yourself , my dear <eos> but let me die , all raillery apart <eos> our sex are still forgiving at their heart <eos> and , did not wicked custom so contrive <eos> we 'd be the best good natured things alive <eos>
birds of a feather will flock together <eos> the robin sings to his ruddy mate <eos> and the chattering jays , in the winter weather <eos> to prate and gossip will congregate <eos> and the cawing crows on the autumn heather <eos> like evil omens , will flock together <eos> in extra session , for high debate <eos> and the lass will slip from a doting mother <eos> to hang with her lad on the garden gate <eos> birds of a feather will flock together <eos> ‘ tis an adage old ,— it is nature 's law <eos> and sure as the pole will the needle draw <eos> the fierce red cloud with the flaunting feather <eos> will follow the finger of h â rpstin à. <eos>
if we should part upon that one embrace <eos> and set our courses ever , each from each <eos> with all our treasure but a fading face <eos> and little ghostly syllables of speech <eos> should beauty 's moment never be renewed <eos> and moons on moons look out for us in vain <eos> and each but whisper from a solitude <eos> to hear but echoes of a lonely pain <eos> still in a world that fortune cannot change <eos> should walk those two that once were you and i <eos> those two that once when moon and stars were strange <eos> poets above us in an april sky <eos> heard a voice falling on the midnight sea <eos> mute , and for ever , but for you and me <eos>
a handmaid to the genius of thy song <eos> is sweet , fair scholarship . ‘ tis she supplies <eos> the fiery spirit of the passioned eyes <eos> with subtle syllables , whose notes belong <eos> to some chief source of perfect melodies <eos> and glancing through a laurelled , lordly throng <eos> of shining singers , lo ! my vision flies <eos> to william shakespeare ! he it is whose strong <eos> full , flute like music haunts thy stately verse <eos> a worthy levite of his court thou art <eos> one sent among us to defeat the curse <eos> that binds us to the actual . yea , thy part <eos> oh , lute voiced lover ! is to lull the heart <eos> of love repelled , its darkness to disperse <eos>
“ new light ! ” men cried , and murmured that it came <eos> from an unsanctioned source with lawless flame <eos> it shone too free , for still the church and school <eos> must only shine according to their rule <eos> but princeton answered , in her nobler mood <eos> “ god made the light , and all the light is good <eos> there is no war between the old and new <eos> the conflict lies between the false and true <eos> the stars , that high in heaven their courses run <eos> in glory differ , but their light is one <eos> the beacons , gleaming o'er the sea of life <eos> are rivals but in radiance , not in strife <eos> shine on , ye sister towers , across the night <eos> i too will build a lasting house of light <eos>
new england ! proudly may thy children claim <eos> their honored birthright by its humblest name <eos> cold are thy skies , but , ever fresh and clear <eos> no rank malaria stains thine atmosphere <eos> no fungous weeds invade thy scanty soil <eos> scarred by the ploughshares of unslumbering toil <eos> long may the doctrines by thy sages taught <eos> raised from the quarries where their sires have wrought <eos> be like the granite of thy rock ribbed land <eos> as slow to rear , as obdurate to stand <eos> and as the ice that leaves thy crystal mine <eos> chills the fierce alcohol in the creole 's wine <eos> so may the doctrines of thy sober school <eos> keep the hot theories of thy neighbors cool <eos>
at the round earth 's imagined corners blow <eos> your trumpets , angels ! and arise , arise <eos> from death , you numberless infinities <eos> of souls , and to your scattered bodies go <eos> all whom the flood did , and fire shall , overthrow <eos> all whom war , death , age , ague 's tyrannies <eos> despair , law , chance , hath slain ; and you whose eyes <eos> shall behold god , and never taste death 's woe <eos> but let them sleep , lord ! and me mourn a space <eos> for if above all these my sins abound <eos> ‘ tis late to ask abundance of thy grace <eos> when we are there . here on this holy ground <eos> teach me how to repent , for that 's as good <eos> as if thou hadst sealed my pardon with thy blood <eos>
less bronze , more silver , mingles in the mould <eos> of him whom next my roving eyes behold <eos> his , more the scholar 's than the statesman 's face <eos> proclaims him born of academic race <eos> weary his look , as if an aching brain <eos> left on his brow the frozen prints of pain <eos> his voice far reaching , grave , sonorous , owns <eos> a shade of sadness in its plaintive tones <eos> yet when its breath some loftier thought inspires <eos> glows with a heat that every bosom fires <eos> such everett seems ; no chance sown wild flower knows <eos> the full blown charms of culture 's double rose <eos> alas , how soon , by death 's unsparing frost <eos> its bloom is faded and its fragrance lost <eos>
thus , anxious , he explored the crowded field <eos> nor once the secret of his birth revealed <eos> heaven will 'd it so . pressed down by silent grief <eos> surrounding objects promised no relief <eos> this world to mortals still denies repose <eos> and life is still the scene of many woes <eos> again his eye , instinctive turned , descried <eos> the green pavilion , and the warrior 's pride <eos> again he cries : “ o tell his glorious name <eos> yon gallant horse declares the hero 's fame <eos> but false huj í r the aspiring hope repelled <eos> crushed the fond wish , the soothing balm withheld <eos> “ and why should i conceal his name from thee <eos> his name and title are unknown to me <eos>
that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect <eos> for slander 's mark was ever yet the fair <eos> the ornament of beauty is suspect <eos> a crow that flies in heaven 's sweetest air <eos> so thou be good , slander doth but approve <eos> thy worth the greater being wooed of time <eos> for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love <eos> and thou present'st a pure unstained prime <eos> thou hast passed by the ambush of young days <eos> either not assailed , or victor being charged <eos> yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise <eos> to tie up envy , evermore enlarged <eos> if some suspect of ill masked not thy show <eos> then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe <eos>
o that you were your self , but love you are <eos> no longer yours , than you your self here live <eos> against this coming end you should prepare <eos> and your sweet semblance to some other give <eos> so should that beauty which you hold in lease <eos> find no determination , then you were <eos> your self again after your self 's decease <eos> when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear <eos> who lets so fair a house fall to decay <eos> which husbandry in honour might uphold <eos> against the stormy gusts of winter 's day <eos> and barren rage of death 's eternal cold <eos> o none but unthrifts , dear my love you know <eos> you had a father , let your son say so <eos>
dear chorister , who from those shadows sends <eos> ere that the blushing morn dare show her light <eos> such sad , lamenting strains , that night attends <eos> become all ear ; stars stay to hear thy plight <eos> if one whose grief even reach of thought transcends <eos> who ne'er , not in a dream , did taste delight <eos> may thee importune who like case pretends <eos> and seems to joy in woe , in woe 's despite <eos> tell me ( so may thou fortune milder try <eos> and long , long sing ) for what thou thus complains <eos> since winter 's gone , and sun in dappled sky <eos> enamour 'd , smiles on woods and flowery plains <eos> the bird , as if my questions did her move <eos> with trembling wings sigh 'd forth , ‘ i love , i love <eos>
there were not many at that lonely place <eos> where two scourged hills met in a little plain <eos> the wind cried loud in gusts , then low again <eos> three pines strained darkly , runners in a race <eos> unseen by any . toward the further woods <eos> a dim harsh noise of voices rose and ceased <eos> — we were most silent in those solitudes <eos> then , sudden as a flame , the black robed priest <eos> the clotted earth piled roughly up about <eos> the hacked red oblong of the new made thing <eos> short words in swordlike latin — and a rout <eos> of dreams most impotent , unwearying <eos> then , like a blind door shut on a carouse <eos> the terrible bareness of the soul 's last house <eos>
as some lone miser , visiting his store <eos> bends at his treasure , counts , recounts it o'er <eos> hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill <eos> yet still he sighs , for hoards are wanting still <eos> thus to my breast alternate passions rise <eos> pleased with each good that heaven to man supplies <eos> yet oft a sigh prevails , and sorrows fall <eos> to see the hoard of human bliss so small <eos> and oft i wish amidst the scene to find <eos> some spot to real happiness consigned <eos> where my worn soul , each wandering hope at rest <eos> may gather bliss to see my fellows blest <eos> but where to find that happiest spot below <eos> who can direct , when all pretend to know <eos>
the silence of the storm weighs heavily <eos> on their strained spirits : sometimes one will say <eos> some trivial thing as though to ward away <eos> mysterious powers , that imminently lie <eos> in wait , with the strong exorcising grace <eos> of everyday 's futility . desire <eos> becomes upon a sudden a crystal fire <eos> defined and hard :— if he could kiss her face <eos> could kiss her hair ! as if by chance , her hand <eos> brushes on his ... ah , can she understand <eos> or is she pedestalled above the touch <eos> of his desire ? he wonders : dare he seek <eos> from her that little , that infinitely much <eos> and suddenly she kissed him on the cheek <eos>
to which the wife — “ dear husband , sad it is <eos> to me to think that thou shouldst part from me <eos> but sadder still the thought that thou shouldst go <eos> on seas to roam in lands unknown and strange <eos> and canst not tell when to this spot return <eos> there is our lordly mansion here ; there is <eos> our wealth , and here i am thy youthful wife <eos> why go away and risk thy precious life <eos> while we enjoy our days like king and queen <eos> why leave me here to pine away in grief <eos> and loneliness ? without my lord it is <eos> half death to me , and i would rather die <eos> than see him part ; hence banish from thy mind <eos> all thoughts of going and stay here with me <eos>
a hundred thousand birds salute the day <eos> one solitary bird salutes the night <eos> its mellow grieving wiles our grief away <eos> and tunes our weary watches to delight <eos> it seems to sing the thoughts we cannot say <eos> to know and sing them , and to set them right <eos> until we feel once more that may is may <eos> and hope some buds may bloom without a blight <eos> this solitary bird outweighs , outvies <eos> the hundred thousand merry making birds <eos> whose innocent warblings yet might make us wise <eos> would we but follow when they bid us rise <eos> would we but set their notes of praise to words <eos> and launch our hearts up with them to the skies <eos>

darkness like midnight from the sobbing woods <eos> clamours with dismal tidings of the rain <eos> roaring as rivers breaking loose in floods <eos> to spread and foam and deluge all the plain <eos> the cotter listens at his door again <eos> half doubting whether it be floods or wind <eos> and through the thickening darkness looks afraid <eos> thinking of roads that travel has to find <eos> through night 's black depths in danger 's garb arrayed <eos> and the loud glabber round the flaze soon stops <eos> when hushed to silence by the lifted hand <eos> of fearing dame who hears the noise in dread <eos> and thinks a deluge comes to drown the land <eos> nor dares she go to bed until the tempest drops <eos>
some glory in their birth , some in their skill <eos> some in their wealth , some in their body 's force <eos> some in their garments though new fangled ill <eos> some in their hawks and hounds , some in their horse <eos> and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure <eos> wherein it finds a joy above the rest <eos> but these particulars are not my measure <eos> all these i better in one general best <eos> thy love is better than high birth to me <eos> richer than wealth , prouder than garments ’ costs <eos> of more delight than hawks and horses be <eos> and having thee , of all men 's pride i boast <eos> wretched in this alone , that thou mayst take <eos> all this away , and me most wretchcd make <eos>

not distant far , a length of colonnade <eos> invites us ; monument of ancient taste <eos> now scorned , but worthy of a better fate <eos> our fathers knew the value of a screen <eos> from sultry suns , and , in their shaded walks <eos> and long protracted bowers , enjoyed at noon <eos> the gloom and coolness of declining day <eos> we bear our shades about us ; self deprived <eos> of other screen , the thin umbrella spread <eos> and range an indian waste without a tree <eos> thanks to benevolus — he spares me yet <eos> these chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines <eos> and , though himself so polished , still reprieves <eos> the obsolete prolixity of shade <eos>
high on a hill a goodly cedar grewe <eos> of wondrous length and straight proportion <eos> that farre abroad her daintie odours threwe <eos> mongst all the daughters of proud libanon <eos> her match in beautie was not anie one <eos> shortly within her inmost pith there bred <eos> a litle wicked worme , perceiv 'd of none <eos> that on her sap and vitall moysture fed <eos> thenceforth her garland so much honoured <eos> began to die , o great ruth * for the same <eos> and her faire lockes fell from her loftie head <eos> that shortly balde and bared she became <eos> i , which this sight beheld , was much dismayed <eos> to see so goodly thing so soone decayed <eos>
thus then he disappeared , was rarified <eos> for ‘ tis improper speech to say he died <eos> he was exhaled ; his great creator drew <eos> his spirit , as the sun the morning dew <eos> ‘ tis sin produces death ; and he had none <eos> but the taint adam left on every son <eos> he added not , he was so pure , so good <eos> ‘ twas but the original forfeit of his blood <eos> and that so little , that the river ran <eos> more clear than the corrupted fount began <eos> nothing remain 'd of the first muddy clay <eos> the length of course had wash 'd it in the way <eos> so deep , and yet so clear , we might behold <eos> the gravel bottom , and that bottom gold <eos>
black grows the southern sky , betokening rain <eos> and humming hive bees homeward hurry bye <eos> they feel the change ; so let us shun the grain <eos> and take the broad road while our feet are dry <eos> ay , there some dropples moistened on my face <eos> and pattered on my hat — tis coming nigh <eos> let 's look about , and find a sheltering place <eos> the little things around , like you and i <eos> are hurrying through the grass to shun the shower <eos> here stoops an ash tree — hark ! the wind gets high <eos> but never mind ; this ivy , for an hour <eos> rain as it may , will keep us dryly here <eos> that little wren knows well his sheltering bower <eos> nor leaves his dry house though we come so near <eos>
when i had chosen on the river 's edge <eos> such station , that the distance of the stream <eos> alone did separate me ; there i stay 'd <eos> my steps for clearer prospect , and beheld <eos> the flames go onward , leaving , as they went <eos> the air behind them painted as with trail <eos> of liveliest pencils ! so distinct were mark 'd <eos> all those sev'n listed colours , whence the sun <eos> maketh his bow , and cynthia her zone <eos> these streaming gonfalons did flow beyond <eos> my vision ; and ten paces , as i guess <eos> parted the outermost . beneath a sky <eos> so beautiful , came foul and twenty elders <eos> by two and two , with flower de luces crown 'd <eos>
thou blind fool love , what dost thou to mine eyes <eos> that they behold and see not what they see <eos> they know what beauty is , see where it lies <eos> yet what the best is , take the worst to be <eos> if eyes corrupt by over partial looks <eos> be anchored in the bay where all men ride <eos> why of eyes ’ falsehood hast thou forged hooks <eos> whereto the judgment of my heart is tied <eos> why should my heart think that a several plot <eos> which my heart knows the wide world 's common place <eos> or mine eyes seeing this , say this is not <eos> to put fair truth upon so foul a face <eos> in things right true my heart and eyes have erred <eos> and to this false plague are they now transferred <eos>
oh , for the time gone by , when thought of christ <eos> made his yoke easy and his burden light <eos> when my heart stirred within me at the sight <eos> of altar spread for awful eucharist <eos> when all my hopes his promises sufficed <eos> when my soul watched for him by day , by night <eos> when my lamp lightened and my robe was white <eos> and all seemed loss , except the pearl unpriced <eos> yet , since he calls me still with tender call <eos> since he remembers whom i half forgot <eos> i even will run my race and bear my lot <eos> for faith the walls of jericho cast down <eos> and hope to whoso runs holds forth a crown <eos> and love is christ , and christ is all in all <eos>
the ticking — ticking — ticking of the clock <eos> that vexed me so last night —! “ for though time keeps <eos> such drowsy watch , ” i moaned , “ he never sleeps <eos> but only nods above the world to mock <eos> its restless occupant , then rudely rock <eos> it as the cradle of a babe that weeps <eos> i seemed to see the seconds piled in heaps <eos> like sand about me ; and at every shock <eos> o ’ the bell , the piled sands were swirled away <eos> as by a desert storm that swept the earth <eos> stark as a granary floor , whereon the gray <eos> and mist bedrizzled moon amidst the dearth <eos> came crawling , like a sickly child , to lay <eos> its pale face next mine own and weep for day <eos>
i am a little world , made cunningly <eos> of elements and an angelic sprite <eos> but black sin hath betrayed to endless night <eos> my world 's both parts , and oh ! both parts must die <eos> you , which beyond that heaven , which was most high <eos> have found new spheres , and of new land can write <eos> pour new seas in mine eyes , that so i might <eos> drown my world with my weeping earnestly <eos> or wash it , if it must be drowned no more <eos> but oh ! it must be burnt ; alas ! the fire <eos> of lust and envy burnt it heretofore <eos> and made it fouler ; let their flames retire <eos> and burn me , o lord ! with a fiery zeal <eos> of thee and thy house , which doth in eating heal <eos>
wings have we , and as far as we can go <eos> we may find pleasure : wilderness and wood <eos> blank ocean and mere sky , support that mood <eos> which with the lofty sanctifies the low <eos> dreams , books , are each a world ; and books , we know <eos> are a substantial world , both pure and good <eos> round these , with tendrils strong as flesh and blood <eos> our pastime and our happiness will grow <eos> there do i find a never failing store <eos> of personal themes , and such as i love best <eos> matter wherein right voluble i am <eos> two will i mention , dearer than the rest <eos> the gentle lady , married to the moor <eos> and heavenly una with her milk white lamb <eos>
whilst echo cries , “ what shall become of me <eos> and desolate , my desolations pity <eos> thou in thy beauty 's carack sitt'st to see <eos> my tragic downfall , and my funeral ditty <eos> no timbrel , but my heart thou play'st upon <eos> whose strings are stretched unto the highest key <eos> the diapason , love ; love is the unison <eos> in love my life and labours waste away <eos> only regardless to the world thou leav'st me <eos> whilst slain hopes , turning from the feast of sorrow <eos> unto despair , their king , which ne'er deceives me <eos> captives my heart , whose black night hates the morrow <eos> and he in truth of my distressed cry <eos> plants me a weeping star within mine eye <eos>
somewhere i read , in an old book whose name <eos> is gone from me , i read that when the days <eos> of a man are counted , and his business done <eos> there comes up the shore at evening , with the tide <eos> to the place where he sits , a boat <eos> and in the boat , from the place where he sits , he sees <eos> dim in the dusk , dim and yet so familiar <eos> the faces of his friends long dead ; and knows <eos> they come for him , brought in upon the tide <eos> to take him where men go at set of day <eos> then rising , with his hands in theirs , he goes <eos> between them his last steps , that are the first <eos> of the new life — and with the ebb they pass <eos> their shaken sail grown small upon the moon <eos>
the richest relic rome did ever view <eos> was ’ c æ sar 's tomb ; on which , with cunning hand <eos> jove 's triple honours , the three fair graces , stand <eos> telling his virtues in their virtues true <eos> this rome admired ; but dearest dear , in you <eos> dwelleth the wonder of the happiest land <eos> and all the world to neptune 's furthest strand <eos> for what rome shaped hath living life in you <eos> thy naked beauty , bounteously displayed <eos> enricheth monarchies of hearts with love <eos> thine eyes to hear complaints are open laid <eos> thine eyes ’ kind looks requite all pains i prove <eos> that of my death i dare not thee accuse <eos> but pride in me that baser chance refuse <eos>
as kings who see their little life day pass <eos> take off the heavy ermine and the crown <eos> so had the trees that autumn time laid down <eos> their golden garments on the faded grass <eos> when i , who watched the seasons in the glass <eos> of mine own thoughts , saw all the autumn 's brown <eos> leap into life and don a sunny gown <eos> of leafage such as happy april has <eos> great spring came singing upward from the south <eos> for in my heart , far carried on the wind <eos> your words like winged seeds took root and grew <eos> and all the world caught music from your mouth <eos> i saw the light as one who had been blind <eos> and knew my sun and song and spring were you <eos>
thrice happy he , who by some shady grove <eos> far from the clamorous world , doth live his own <eos> though solitary , who is not alone <eos> but doth converse with that eternal love <eos> o how more sweet is birds ’ harmonious moan <eos> or the soft sobbings of the widowed dove <eos> than those smooth whisperings near a prince 's throne <eos> which good make doubtful , do the evil approve <eos> or how more sweet is zephyr 's wholesome breath <eos> and sighs perfumed which do the flowers unfold <eos> than that applause vain honor doth bequeath <eos> how sweet are streams to poison drunk in gold <eos> the world is full of horrors , falsehoods , slights <eos> woods ’ silent shades have only true delights <eos>
an hideous dragon , dreadfull to behold <eos> whose backe was arm 'd against the dint of speare <eos> with shields of brasse that shone like burnisht golde <eos> and forkhed sting that death in it did beare <eos> strove with a spider , his unequall peare <eos> and bad defiance to his enemie <eos> the subtill vermin , creeping closely * neare <eos> did in his drinke shed poyson privilie <eos> which , through his entrailes spredding diversly <eos> made him to swell , that nigh his bowells brust <eos> and him enforst to yeeld the victorie <eos> that did so much in his owne greatnesse trust <eos> o , how great vainnesse is it then to scorne <eos> the weake , that hath the strong so oft forlorne <eos>
the god obeys , and to his feet applies <eos> those golden wings that cut the yielding skies <eos> his ample hat his beamy locks o'erspread <eos> and veil 'd the starry glories of his head <eos> he seized the wand that causes sleep to fly <eos> or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye <eos> that drives the dead to dark tartarean coasts <eos> or back to life compels the wandering ghosts <eos> thus through the parting clouds the son of may <eos> wings on the whistling winds his rapid way <eos> now smoothly steers through air his equal flight <eos> now springs aloft , and towers th ’ ethereal height <eos> then wheeling down the steep of heaven he flies <eos> and draws a radiant circle o'er the skies <eos>
dear craoibhin aoibhin , look into our case <eos> when we are high and airy hundreds say <eos> that if we hold that flight they 'll leave the place <eos> while those same hundreds mock another day <eos> because we have made our art of common things <eos> so bitterly , you 'd dream they longed to look <eos> all their lives through into some drift of wings <eos> you 've dandled them and fed them from the book <eos> and know them to the bone ; impart to us <eos> we 'll keep the secret — a new trick to please <eos> is there a bridle for this proteus <eos> that turns and changes like his draughty seas <eos> or is there none , most popular of men <eos> but when they mock us that we mock again <eos>
they flout me as half english — a disgrace <eos> for which scarce all your virtues can atone <eos> mother , in whom i find no flaw but one <eos> that you are saxon !— but this fault of race <eos> fell not on me nor yet , i fear , your grace <eos> of english speech , else had more smoothly run <eos> these echoes of welsh lyrics , and your son <eos> need not have flinched before the critic 's face <eos> such as they are , from your far yorkshire home <eos> perchance they may in fancy bid you come <eos> pondering past memories , to my native land <eos> once more to see fair mawddach from the bridge <eos> to mark how cader rises , ridge on ridge <eos> or , where llanaber guards our dead , to stand <eos>
the city slept beneath the moonbeam 's glance <eos> her white walls gleaming through the vines of france <eos> and all was hushed , save where the footsteps fell <eos> on some high tower , of midnight sentinel <eos> but one still watched ; no self encircled woes <eos> chased from his lids the angel of repose <eos> he watched , he wept , for thoughts of bitter years <eos> bowed his dark lashes , wet with burning tears <eos> his country 's sufferings and her children 's shame <eos> streamed o'er his memory like a forest 's flame <eos> each treasured insult , each remembered wrong <eos> rolled through his heart and kindled into song <eos> his taper faded ; and the morning gales <eos> swept through the world the war song of marseilles <eos>
within this wood , out of a rocke did rise <eos> a spring of water , mildly rumbling downe <eos> whereto approched not in anie wise <eos> the homely shepheard , nor the ruder clowne <eos> but manie muses , and the nymphes withall <eos> that sweetly in accord did tune their voyce <eos> to the soft sounding of the waters fall <eos> that my glad hart thereat did much reioyce <eos> but , while herein i tooke my chiefe delight <eos> i saw , alas ! the gaping earth devoure <eos> the spring , the place , and all cleane out of sight <eos> which yet aggreeves my hart even to this houre <eos> and wounds my soule with rufull memorie <eos> to see such pleasures gon so suddenly <eos>
among the wondrous ways of men and time <eos> he went as one that ever found and sought <eos> and bore in hand the lamplike spirit of thought <eos> to illume with instance of its fire sublime <eos> the dusk of many a cloudlike age and clime <eos> no spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought <eos> no faith , no fear , no dream , no rapture , nought <eos> that blooms in wisdom , nought that burns in crime <eos> no virtue girt and armed and helmed with light <eos> no love more lovely than the snows are white <eos> no serpent sleeping in some dead soul 's tomb <eos> no song bird singing from some live soul 's height <eos> but he might hear , interpret , or illume <eos> with sense invasive as the dawn of doom <eos>
something this foggy day , a something which <eos> is neither of this fog nor of to day <eos> has set me dreaming of the winds that play <eos> past certain cliffs , along one certain beach <eos> and turn the topmost edge of waves to spray <eos> ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away <eos> so out of reach while quite within my reach <eos> as out of reach as india or cathay <eos> i am sick of where i am and where i am not <eos> i am sick of foresight and of memory <eos> i am sick of all i have and all i see <eos> i am sick of self , and there is nothing new <eos> oh weary impatient patience of my lot <eos> thus with myself : how fares it , friends , with you <eos>

stretched on a sunny bank he lay at rest <eos> ferns at his elbow , lilies round his knees <eos> with sweet flesh patterned where the cool turf pressed <eos> flowerlike crept o'er with emerald aphides <eos> single he couched there , to his circling flocks <eos> piping at times some happy shepherd 's tune <eos> nude , with the warm wind in his golden locks <eos> and arched with the blue asian afternoon <eos> past him , gorse purpled , to the distant coast <eos> rolled the clear foothills . there his white walled town <eos> there , a blue band , the placid euxine lay <eos> beyond , on fields of azure light embossed <eos> he watched from noon till dewy eve came down <eos> the summer clouds pile up and fade away <eos>
when the first larvae on the elm are seen <eos> the crawling wretches , like its leaves , are green <eos> ere chill october shakes the latest down <eos> they , like the foliage , change their tint to brown <eos> on the blue flower a bluer flower you spy <eos> you stretch to pluck it — ‘ tis a butterfly <eos> the flattened tree toads so resemble bark <eos> they 're hard to find as ethiops in the dark <eos> the woodcock , stiffening to fictitious mud <eos> cheats the young sportsman thirsting for his blood <eos> so by long living on a single lie <eos> nay , on one truth , will creatures get its dye <eos> red , yellow , green , they take their subject 's hue <eos> except when squabbling turns them black and blue <eos>
the sands of westmoreland , the creeks and bays <eos> of cumbria 's rocky limits , they can tell <eos> how , when the sea threw off his evening shade <eos> and to the shepherd 's hut on distant hills <eos> sent welcome notice of the rising moon <eos> how i have stood , to fancies such as these <eos> a stranger , linking with the spectacle <eos> no conscious memory of a kindred sight <eos> and bringing with me no peculiar sense <eos> of quietness or peace ; yet have i stood <eos> even while mine eye hath moved o'er many a league <eos> of shining water , gathering as it seemed <eos> through every hair breadth in that field of light <eos> new pleasure like a bee among the flowers <eos>
scorn only , scorn begot of bitter proof <eos> by keen experience of a trustless heart <eos> bears burning in her new born hand the dart <eos> wherewith love dies heart stricken , and the roof <eos> falls of his palace , and the storied woof <eos> long woven of many a year with life 's whole art <eos> is rent like any rotten weed apart <eos> and hardly with reluctant eyes aloof <eos> cold memory guards one relic scarce exempt <eos> yet from the fierce corrosion of contempt <eos> and hardly saved by pity . woe are we <eos> that once we loved , and love not ; but we know <eos> the ghost of love , surviving yet in show <eos> where scorn has passed , is vain as grief must be <eos>
no sooner on my vision streaming , smote <eos> the heav'nly influence , which years past , and e'en <eos> in childhood , thrill 'd me , than towards virgil i <eos> turn 'd me to leftward , panting , like a babe <eos> that flees for refuge to his mother 's breast <eos> if aught have terrified or work 'd him woe <eos> and would have cried : “ there is no dram of blood <eos> that doth not quiver in me . the old flame <eos> throws out clear tokens of reviving fire <eos> but virgil had bereav 'd us of himself <eos> virgil , my best lov 'd father ; virgil , he <eos> to whom i gave me up for safety : nor <eos> all , our prime mother lost , avail 'd to save <eos> my undew 'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears <eos>
thou pain , the only guest of loathed constraint <eos> the child of curse , man 's weakness foster child <eos> brother to woe , and father of complaint <eos> thou pain , thou hated pain , from heaven exiled <eos> how hold'st thou her whose eyes constraint doth fear <eos> whom cursed do bless ; whose weakness virtues arm <eos> who others ’ woes and plaints can chastely bear <eos> in whose sweet heaven angels of high thoughts swarm <eos> what courage strange hath caught thy caitiff heart <eos> fear'st not a face that oft whole hearts devours <eos> or art thou from above bid play this part <eos> and so no help ‘ gainst envy of those powers <eos> if thus , alas , yet while those parts have woe <eos> so stay her tongue , that she no more say , “ o <eos>
why are we by all creatures waited on <eos> why do the prodigal elements supply <eos> life and food to me , being more pure than i <eos> simpler , and further from corruption <eos> why brook'st thou , ignorant horse , subjection <eos> why do you , bull and boar , so sillily <eos> dissemble weakness , and by one man 's stroke die <eos> whose whole kind you might swallow and feed upon <eos> weaker i am , woe 's me ! and worse than you <eos> you have not sinned , nor need be timorous <eos> but wonder at a greater , for to us <eos> created nature doth these things subdue <eos> but their creator , whom sin nor nature tied <eos> for us , his creatures and his foes , hath died <eos>
falls from her heaven the moon , and stars sink burning <eos> into the sea where blackness rims the sea <eos> silently quenched . faint light that the waves hold <eos> is only light remaining ; yet still gleam <eos> the sands where those now sleeping young moon bathers <eos> came dripping out of the sea and from their arms <eos> shook flakes of light , dancing on the foamy edge <eos> of quiet waves . they were all things of light <eos> tossed from the sea to dance under the moon <eos> her nuns , dancing within her dying round <eos> clear limbs and breasts silvered with moon and waves <eos> and quick with windlike mood and body 's joy <eos> withdrawn from alien vows , by wave and wind <eos> lightly absolved and lightly all forgetting <eos>

huge elm , with rifted trunk all notched and scarred <eos> like to a warrior 's destiny ! i love <eos> to stretch me often on thy shadowed sward <eos> and hear the laugh of summer leaves above <eos> or on thy buttressed roots to sit , and lean <eos> in careless attitude , and there reflect <eos> on times , and deeds , and darings that have been <eos> old castaways , now swallowed in neglect <eos> while thou art towering in thy strength of heart <eos> stirring the soul to vain imaginings <eos> in which life 's sordid being hath no part <eos> the wind of that eternal ditty sings <eos> humming of future things , that burn the mind <eos> to leave some fragment of itself behind <eos>
then woe is me ! ah ! how was i befooled <eos> i thought that gold ( which answereth all things ) could <eos> have stood my friend at any time to bail me <eos> but grief grows great , and now my trust doth fail me <eos> oh ! that my conscience were but clear within <eos> which now is racked with my former sin <eos> with horror i behold my secret stealing <eos> my bribes , oppression , and my graceless dealing <eos> my office sins , which i had clean forgotten <eos> will gnaw my soul when all my bones are rotten <eos> i must confess it , very grief doth force me <eos> dead or alive , both god and man doth curse me <eos> let all excisemen hereby warning take <eos> to shun their practice for their conscience sake <eos>
brave ships are these that bear thee home again <eos> from under far off skies — brave flags that fly <eos> above the deck whereon thine ashes lie <eos> waiting their urn beyond the alien main <eos> the nations pause to view thy funeral train <eos> as slowly moving up ‘ twixt sea and sky <eos> it comes with stately pomp , and liberty <eos> holds out her hands and calls thy name in vain <eos> and yet , mayhap , in vision vague and sweet <eos> another sight thou seest beyond the boast <eos> of patriot pride — beside the new born fleet <eos> spectral and strange , no guest for such a host <eos> yet making thy home coming all complete <eos> the old “ bon homme richard 's ” unlaid ghost <eos>

on village green , whose smooth and well worn sod <eos> cross path 'd with every gossip 's foot is trod <eos> by cottage door where playful children run <eos> and cats and curs sit basking in the sun <eos> where o'er the earthen seat the thorn is bent <eos> cross arm 'd , and back to wall , poor william leant <eos> his bonnet broad drawn o'er his gather 'd brow <eos> his hanging lip and lengthen 'd visage shew <eos> a mind but ill at ease . with motions strange <eos> his listless limbs their wayward postures change <eos> whilst many a crooked line and curious maze <eos> with clouted shoon , he on the sand pourtrays <eos> the half chew 'd straw fell slowly from his mouth <eos> and to himself low mutt'ring spoke the youth <eos>
white envoy : [ stepping forward <eos> greeting from shalmaneser , asshur 's son <eos> who rules the world from nineveh <eos> unto benhadad , monarch in damascus <eos> the conquering bull has led his army forth <eos> the south has fallen before him , and the west <eos> his feet have trodden ; hamath is laid waste <eos> he pauses at your gate , invincible <eos> to offer peace . the princes of your court <eos> the priests of rimmon 's house , and you , the king <eos> if you pay homage to your overlord <eos> shall rest secure , and flourish as our friends <eos> assyria sends to you this gilded yoke <eos> receive it as the sign of proffered peace <eos>
‘ has truth no charms ? ’ when first beheld , i grant <eos> but , wanting novelty , has every want <eos> for pleasure 's thrill the sickly palate flies <eos> save haply pungent with a rare surprise <eos> the humble toad that leaps her nightly round <eos> the harmless tenant of the garden ground <eos> is loath 'd , abhor 'd , nay , all the reptile race <eos> together join 'd were never half so base <eos> yet snugly find her in some quarry pent <eos> through ages doom 'd to one tremendous lent <eos> surviving still , as if “ in nature 's spite <eos> without or nourishment , or air , or light <eos> what raptures then th ’ astonish 'd gazer seize <eos> what lovely creature like a toad can please <eos>
if i must die , o let me chuse my death <eos> suck out my soul with kisses , cruel maid <eos> in thy breasts crystal balls embalm my breath <eos> dole it all out in sighs when i am laid <eos> thy lips on mine like cupping glasses clasp <eos> let our tongues meet , and strive as they would sting <eos> crush out my wind with one straight girting grasp <eos> stabs on my heart keep time whilst thou dost sing <eos> thy eyes like searing irons burn out mine <eos> in thy fair tresses stifle me outright <eos> like circes , change me to a loathsom swine <eos> so i may live for ever in thy sight <eos> into heavens joys can none profoundly see <eos> except that first they meditate on thee <eos>
some praise the looks , and others praise the locks <eos> of their fair queens , in love with curious words <eos> some laud the breast where love his treasure locks <eos> all like the eye that life and love affords <eos> but none of these frail beauties and unstable <eos> shall make my pen riot in pompous style <eos> more greater gifts shall my grave muse enable <eos> whereat severer brows shall never smile <eos> i praise her honey sweeter eloquence <eos> which from the fountain of true wisdom floweth <eos> her modest mien that matcheth excellence <eos> her matchless faith which from her virtue groweth <eos> and could my style her happy virtues equal <eos> time had no power her glories to enthral <eos>
but , ah ! ye maids , beware the gipsy 's lures <eos> she opens not the womb of time , but yours <eos> oft has her hands the hapless marian wrung <eos> marian , whom gay in sweetest strains has sung <eos> the parson 's maid — sore cause had she to rue <eos> the gipsy 's tongue ; the parson 's daughter too <eos> long had that anxious daughter sighed to know <eos> what vellum 's sprucy clerk , the valley 's beau <eos> meant by those glances which at church he stole <eos> her father nodding to the psalm 's slow drawl <eos> long had she sighed ; at length a prophet came <eos> by many a sure prediction known to fame <eos> to marian known , and all she told , for true <eos> she knew the future , for the past she knew <eos>
it hath been heretofore my chance to see <eos> horsemen with martial order shifting camp <eos> to onset sallying , or in muster rang 'd <eos> or in retreat sometimes outstretch 'd for flight <eos> light armed squadrons and fleet foragers <eos> scouring thy plains , arezzo ! have i seen <eos> and clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts <eos> now with the sound of trumpets , now of bells <eos> tabors , or signals made from castled heights <eos> and with inventions multiform , our own <eos> or introduc 'd from foreign land ; but ne'er <eos> to such a strange recorder i beheld <eos> in evolution moving , horse nor foot <eos> nor ship , that tack 'd by sign from land or star <eos>
a host of things i take on trust : i take <eos> the nightingales on trust , for few and far <eos> between those actual summer moments are <eos> when i have heard what melody they make <eos> so chanced it once at como on the lake <eos> but all things , then , waxed musical ; each star <eos> sang on its course , each breeze sang on its car <eos> all harmonies sang to senses wide awake <eos> all things in tune , myself not out of tune <eos> those nightingales were nightingales indeed <eos> yet truly an owl had satisfied my need <eos> and wrought a rapture underneath that moon <eos> or simple sparrow chirping from a reed <eos> for june that night glowed like a doubled june <eos>
yes , nature 's road must ever be preferr 'd <eos> reason is here no guide , but still a guard <eos> ‘ tis hers to rectify , not overthrow <eos> and treat this passion more as friend than foe <eos> a mightier power the strong direction sends <eos> and several men impels to several ends <eos> like varying winds , by other passions tost <eos> this drives them constant to a certain coast <eos> let power or knowledge , gold or glory , please <eos> or ( oft more strong than all ) the love of ease <eos> through life ‘ tis follow 'd , even at life 's expense <eos> the merchant 's toil , the sage 's indolence <eos> the monk 's humility , the hero 's pride <eos> all , all alike , find reason on their side <eos>
art thou already weary of the way <eos> thou who hast yet but half the way gone o'er <eos> get up , and lift thy burthen : lo , before <eos> thy feet the road goes stretching far away <eos> if thou already faint , who hast but come <eos> through half thy pilgrimage , with fellows gay <eos> love , youth , and hope , under the rosy bloom <eos> and temperate airs , of early breaking day <eos> look yonder , how the heavens stoop and gloom <eos> there cease the trees to shade , the flowers to spring <eos> and the angels leave thee ; what wilt thou become <eos> through yon drear stretch of dismal wandering <eos> lonely and dark ? i shall take courage , friend <eos> for comes not every step more near the end <eos>
then tall wak â wa arose and said <eos> “ brave warriors , listen , and give due heed <eos> great is hey ó ka , the magical god <eos> he can walk on the air ; he can float on the flood <eos> he 's a worker of magic and wonderful wise <eos> he cries when he laughs and he laughs when he cries <eos> he sweats when he 's cold , and he shivers when hot <eos> and the water is cold in his boiling pot <eos> he hides in the earth and he walks in disguise <eos> but he loves the brave and their sacrifice <eos> we are sons of hey ó ka . the giant commands <eos> in the boiling water to thrust our hands <eos> and the warrior that scorneth the foe and fire <eos> hey ó ka will crown with his heart 's desire <eos>
if i let fall a word of bitter mirth <eos> when public shames more shameful pardon won <eos> some have misjudged me , and my service done <eos> if small , yet faithful , deemed of little worth <eos> through veins that drew their life from western earth <eos> two hundred years and more my blood hath run <eos> in no polluted course from sire to son <eos> and thus was i predestined ere my birth <eos> to love the soil wherewith my fibres own <eos> instinctive sympathies ; yet love it so <eos> as honor would , nor lightly to dethrone <eos> judgment , the stamp of manhood , nor forego <eos> the son 's right to a mother dearer grown <eos> with growing knowledge and more chaste than snow <eos>
why write i thus ? for souls in heavenly bliss <eos> feel not our woes — know not what sorrow is <eos> unless their past experiences they feel <eos> to aid , by contrast , in producing weal <eos> for it is written , “ god shall wipe away <eos> tears from all faces , ” in eternal day <eos> then let me rest content , and strive to show <eos> true patience , while i suffer here below <eos> and follow christ wherever he may lead <eos> thus proving faith sincere by every deed <eos> o , then , whenever he may call me hence <eos> i shall be willing to leave time and sense <eos> and mount aloft to dwell with god forever <eos> to taste that bliss from which naught can me sever <eos>
the glorious pourtraict of that angels face <eos> made to amaze weake mens confused skil <eos> and this worlds worthlesse glory to embase <eos> what pen , what pencil !, can expresse her fill <eos> for though he colours could devize at will <eos> and eke his learned hand at pleasure guide <eos> least , trembling , it his workmanship should spill <eos> yet many wondrous things there are beside <eos> the sweet eye glaunces , that like arrowes glide <eos> the charming smiles , that rob sence from the hart <eos> the lovely pleasance , and the lofty pride <eos> cannot expressed be by any art <eos> a greater craftesmans hand thereto doth neede <eos> that can expresse the life of things indeed <eos>
i lived with visions for my company <eos> instead of men and women , years ago <eos> and found them gentle mates , nor thought to know <eos> a sweeter music than they played to me <eos> but soon their trailing purple was not free <eos> of this world 's dust , their lutes did silent grow <eos> and i myself grew faint and blind below <eos> their vanishing eyes . then thou didst come — to be <eos> beloved , what they seemed . their shining fronts <eos> their songs , their splendours , ( better , yet the same <eos> as river water hallowed into fonts <eos> met in thee , and from out thee overcame <eos> my soul with satisfaction of all wants <eos> because god 's gifts put man 's best dreams to shame <eos>
“ ‘ think it not loss of time a while to stay <eos> tho ’ thy companions chide thy long delay <eos> tho ’ summon 'd to the seas , tho ’ pleasing gales <eos> invite thy course , and stretch thy swelling sails <eos> but beg the sacred priestess to relate <eos> with willing words , and not to write thy fate <eos> the fierce italian people she will show <eos> and all thy wars , and all thy future woe <eos> and what thou may'st avoid , and what must undergo <eos> she shall direct thy course , instruct thy mind <eos> and teach thee how the happy shores to find <eos> this is what heav'n allows me to relate <eos> now part in peace ; pursue thy better fate <eos> and raise , by strength of arms , the trojan state <eos>
time , cruel time , come and subdue that brow <eos> which conquers all but thee , and thee too stays <eos> as if she were exempt from scythe or bow <eos> from love or years unsubject to decays <eos> or art thou grown in league with those fair eyes <eos> that they may help thee to consume our days <eos> or dost thou spare her for her cruelties <eos> being merciless like thee that no man weighs <eos> and yet thou seest thy power she disobeys <eos> cares not for thee , but lets thee waste in vain <eos> and prodigal of hours and years betrays <eos> beauty and youth t'opinion and disdain <eos> yet spare her , time ; let her exempted be <eos> she may become more kind to thee or me <eos>
is that a swan that rides upon the water <eos> oh no , it is that other gentle bird <eos> which is the patron of our noble calling <eos> i well remember , in my early years <eos> when these young hands first closed upon a goose <eos> i have a scar upon my thimble finger <eos> which chronicles the hour of young ambition <eos> my father was a tailor , and his father <eos> and my sire 's grandsire , all of them were tailors <eos> they had an ancient goose ,— it was an heirloom <eos> from some remoter tailor of our race <eos> it happened i did see it on a time <eos> when none was near , and i did deal with it <eos> and it did burn me ,— oh , most fearfully <eos>
and have i heard her say , “ o cruel pain <eos> and doth she know what mould her beauty bears <eos> mourns she in truth , and thinks that others feign <eos> fears she to feel , and feels not others ’ fears <eos> or doth she think all pain the mind forbears <eos> that heavy earth , not fiery spirits , may plain <eos> that eyes weep worse than heart in bloody tears <eos> that sense feels more than what doth sense contain <eos> no , no , she is too wise , she knows her face <eos> hath not such pain as it makes others have <eos> she knows the sickness of that perfect place <eos> hath yet such health , as it my life can save <eos> but this , she thinks , our pain high cause excuseth <eos> where her , who should rule pain , false pain abuseth <eos>
thro ’ changing months a well attemper 'd mind <eos> welcomes their gentle or terrific pace <eos> when o'er retreating autumn 's golden grace <eos> tempestuous winter spreads in every wind <eos> naked asperity , our musings find <eos> grandeur increasing , as the glooms efface <eos> variety and glow .— each solemn trace <eos> exalts the thoughts , from sensual joys refin 'd <eos> then blended in our rapt ideas rise <eos> the vanish 'd charms , that summer suns reveal <eos> with all of desolation , that now lies <eos> dreary before us ;— teach the soul to feel <eos> awe in the present , pleasure in the past <eos> and to see vernal morns in hope 's perspective cast <eos>
how beautiful it is to wake at night <eos> another night , in darkness yet more still <eos> save when the myriad leaves on full fledged boughs <eos> filled rather by the perfume 's wandering flood <eos> than by dispansion of the still sweet air <eos> shall from the furthest utter silences <eos> in glimmering secrecy have gathered up <eos> an host of whisperings and scattered sighs <eos> to loose at last a sound as of the plunge <eos> and lapsing seethe of some pacific wave <eos> which , risen from the star thronged outer troughs <eos> rolls in to wreathe with circling foam away <eos> the flutter of the golden moths that haunt <eos> the star 's one glimmer daggered on wet sands <eos>
safe from the storm ; the harbor lights of peace <eos> before his eyes ; the burden of dark fears <eos> cast from him like a cloak ; and in his ears <eos> the heart beat music of a great release <eos> captain and pilot , back upon the seas <eos> whose wrath he 'd weathered , back he looks with tears <eos> seeing no shadow of the death that nears <eos> stealthy and sure , with sudden agonies <eos> so let him stand , brother to every man <eos> ready for toil or battle ; he who held <eos> a nation 's destinies within his hand <eos> type of our greatness ; first american <eos> by whom the hearts of all men are compelled <eos> and with whose name freedom unites our land <eos>
and if with thee some hapless maid should stray <eos> disastrous love companion of her way <eos> oh , lead her timid steps to yonder glade <eos> whose arching cliffs depending alders shade <eos> there , as meek evening wakes her temperate breeze <eos> and moonbeams glimmer through the trembling trees <eos> the rills that gurgle round shall soothe her ear <eos> the weeping rocks shall number tear for tear <eos> there as sad philomel , alike forlorn <eos> sings to the night from her accustomed thorn <eos> while at sweet intervals each falling note <eos> sighs in the gale , and whispers round the grot <eos> the sister woe shall calm her aching breast <eos> and softer slumbers steal her cares to rest <eos>
“ teacups , arouse ! ” ‘ t was thus the spell i broke <eos> the drowsy started and the slumberers woke <eos> “ the sleep i promised you have now enjoyed <eos> due to your hour of labor well employed <eos> swiftly the busy moments have been passed <eos> this , our first ‘ teacups , ’ must not be our last <eos> here , on this spot , now consecrated ground <eos> the order of ‘ the teacups ’ let us found <eos> by winter 's fireside and in summer 's bower <eos> still shall it claim its ever welcome hour <eos> in distant regions where our feet may roam <eos> the magic teapot find or make a home <eos> long may its floods their bright infusion pour <eos> till time and teacups both shall be no more <eos>
not so , replied the disappointed dame <eos> we 'll put it off :— perhaps ‘ twould hurt your frame <eos> your health i value , and i would advise <eos> to be at ease , take breath , and prudence prize <eos> apprentice in a shop you now are bound <eos> next ‘ prentice go to some gallant around <eos> you 'll not so soon his pleasing art require <eos> nor to your tutorage can i now aspire <eos> friend nicaise take some neighb'ring servant maid <eos> you 're quite a master in the shopping trade <eos> stuffs you can sell , and ask the highest price <eos> and to advantage turn things in a trice <eos> but opportunity you can n't discern <eos> to know its value ,— prithee go and learn <eos>
and wilt thou have me fashion into speech <eos> the love i bear thee , finding words enough <eos> and hold the torch out , while the winds are rough <eos> between our faces , to cast light on each <eos> i drop it at thy feet . i cannot teach <eos> my hand to hold my spirits so far off <eos> from myself — me — that i should bring thee proof <eos> in words , of love hid in me out of reach <eos> nay , let the silence of my womanhood <eos> commend my woman love to thy belief <eos> seeing that i stand unwon , however wooed <eos> and rend the garment of my life , in brief <eos> by a most dauntless , voiceless fortitude <eos> lest one touch of this heart convey its grief <eos>
fayre bosome ! fraught with vertues richest tresure <eos> the neast of love , the lodging of delight <eos> the bowre of blisse , the paradice of pleasure <eos> the sacred harbour of that hevenly spright <eos> how was i ravisht with your lovely sight <eos> and my frayle thoughts too rashly led astray <eos> whiles diving deepe through amorous insight <eos> on the sweet spoyle of beautie they did pray <eos> and twixt her paps , like early fruit in may <eos> whose harvest seemd to hasten now apace <eos> they loosely did theyr wanton winges display <eos> and there to rest themselves did boldly place <eos> sweet thoughts ! i envy your so happy rest <eos> which oft i wisht , yet never was so blest <eos>
to gasperin 's so often went our wight <eos> the wife at length became his sole delight <eos> whose youth and beauty were by all confessed <eos> but , ‘ midst these charms , such av'rice she possessed <eos> the warmest love was checked — a thing not rare <eos> in modern times at least , among the fair <eos> ‘ tis true , as i 've already said , with such <eos> sighs naught avail , and promises not much <eos> without a purse , who wishes should express <eos> would vainly hope to gain a soft caress <eos> the god of love no other charm employs <eos> then cards , and dress , and pleasure 's cheering joys <eos> from whose gay shops more cuckolds we behold <eos> than heroes sallied from troy 's horse of old <eos>
down in a valley , by a forest 's side <eos> near where the crystal thames rolls on her waves <eos> i saw a mushroom stand in haughty pride <eos> as if the lilies grew to be his slaves <eos> the gentle daisy , with her silver crown <eos> worn in the breast of many a shepherd 's lass <eos> the humble violet , that lowly down <eos> salutes the gay nymphs as they trimly pass <eos> these , with a many more , methought , complain 'd <eos> that nature should those needless things produce <eos> which not alone the sun from others gain 'd <eos> but turn it wholly to their proper use <eos> i could not choose but grieve that nature made <eos> so glorious flowers to live in such a shade <eos>
wilt thou be still unkind and kill me so <eos> whose humbled vows with sorrowful appeal <eos> do still persist , and did so long ago <eos> intreat for pity with so pure a zeal <eos> suffice the world shall , for the world can say <eos> how much thy power hath power , and what it can <eos> never was victor hand yet moved to slay <eos> the rendered captive , or the yielding man <eos> then , o , why should thy woman thought impose <eos> death and disdain on him that yields his breath <eos> to free his soul from discontent and woes <eos> and humble sacrifice to a certain death <eos> o since the world knows what the power can do <eos> what were't for thee to save and love me too <eos>
my soul is a stiff pageant , man by man <eos> of some egyptian art than egypt older <eos> found in some tomb whose rite no guess can scan <eos> where all things else to coloured dust did moulder <eos> whate ’ er its sense may mean , its age is twin <eos> to that of priesthoods whose feet stood near god <eos> when knowledge was so great that ’ twas a sin <eos> and man ’ s mere soul too man for its abode <eos> but when i ask what means that pageant i <eos> and would look at it suddenly , i lose <eos> the sense i had of seeing it , nor can try <eos> again to look , nor hath my memory a use <eos> that seems recalling , save that it recalls <eos> an emptiness of having seen those walls <eos>
the key will stammer , and the door reply <eos> the hall wake , yawn , and smile ; the torpid stair <eos> will grumble at our feet , the table cry <eos> ‘ fetch my belongings for me ; i am bare <eos> a clatter ! something in the attic falls <eos> a ghost has lifted up his robes and fled <eos> the loitering shadows move along the walls <eos> then silence very slowly lifts his head <eos> the starling with impatient screech has flown <eos> the chimney , and is watching from the tree <eos> they thought us gone for ever : mouse alone <eos> stops in the middle of the floor to see <eos> now all you idle things , resume your toil <eos> hearth , put your flames on . sulky kettle , boil <eos>
i do not care for kisses . ‘ tis a debt <eos> we paid for the first privilege of love <eos> these are the rains of april which have wet <eos> our fallow hearts and forced their germs to move <eos> now the green corn has sprouted . each new day <eos> brings better pleasures , a more dear surprise <eos> the blade , the ear , the harvest — and our way <eos> leads through a region wealthy grown and wise <eos> we now compare our fortunes . each his store <eos> displays to kindred eyes of garnered grain <eos> two happy farmers , learned in love 's lore <eos> who weigh and touch and argue and complain <eos> dear endless argument ! yet sometimes we <eos> even as we argue kiss . there ! let it be <eos>
whenas her lute is tun è d to her voice <eos> the air grows proud for honour of that sound <eos> and rocks do leap to show how they rejoice <eos> that in the earth such music should be found <eos> whenas her hair more worth , more pale than gold <eos> like silver thread lies wafting in the air <eos> diana like she looks , but yet more bold <eos> cruel in chase , more chaste and yet more fair <eos> whenas she smiles , the clouds for envy breaks <eos> she jove in pride encounters with a check <eos> the sun doth shine for joy whenas she speaks <eos> thus heaven and earth do homage at her beck <eos> yet all these graces , blots , not graces are <eos> if you , my love , of love do take no care <eos>
this bronze doth keep the very form and mold <eos> of our great martyr 's face . yes , this is he <eos> that brow all wisdom , all benignity <eos> that human , humorous mouth ; those cheeks that hold <eos> like some harsh landscape all the summer 's gold <eos> that spirit fit for sorrow , as the sea <eos> for storms to beat on ; the lone agony <eos> those silent , patient lips too well foretold <eos> yes , this is he who ruled a world of men <eos> as might some prophet of the elder day <eos> brooding above the tempest and the fray <eos> with deep eyed thought and more than mortal ken <eos> a power was his beyond the touch of art <eos> or armed strength — his pure and mighty heart <eos>
how heavy do i journey on the way <eos> when what i seek ( my weary travel 's end <eos> doth teach that case and that repose to say <eos> ‘ thus far the miles are measured from thy friend <eos> the beast that bears me , tired with my woe <eos> plods dully on , to bear that weight in me <eos> as if by some instinct the wretch did know <eos> his rider loved not speed being made from thee <eos> the bloody spur cannot provoke him on <eos> that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide <eos> which heavily he answers with a groan <eos> more sharp to me than spurring to his side <eos> for that same groan doth put this in my mind <eos> my grief lies onward and my joy behind <eos>
‘ o child , when my words your sweet youth beguil 'd <eos> i meant to make you the happiest child <eos> i meant that no earthly life should be known <eos> as bless 'd as the life i had made my own <eos> my weakness and follies i had forgot <eos> but you were happy with me , were you not <eos> i am not worthy my love should come <eos> forsaking for my sake her english home <eos> exiled from all that is happy and good <eos> caress 'd by a hand that is stain 'd with blood <eos> your innocent face shall never be kiss 'd <eos> by him who his heaven and hope has miss 'd <eos> i suffer for sin , as i ought to do <eos> but , my darling , it shall not fall on you <eos>
i do not care to talk to you although <eos> your speech evokes a thousand sympathies <eos> and all my being 's silent harmonies <eos> wake trembling into music . when you go <eos> it is as if some sudden , dreadful blow <eos> had severed all the strings with savage ease <eos> no , do not talk ; but let us rather seize <eos> this intimate gift of silence which we know <eos> others may guess your thoughts from what you say <eos> as storms are guessed from clouds where darkness broods <eos> to me the very essence of the day <eos> reveals its inner purpose and its moods <eos> as poplars feel the rain and then straightway <eos> reverse their leaves and shimmer through the woods <eos>
why died i not whenas i last did sleep <eos> o sleep too short that shadowed forth my dear <eos> heavens , hear my prayers , nor thus me waking keep <eos> for this were heaven , if thus i sleeping were <eos> for in that dark there shone a princely light <eos> two milk white hills , both full of nectar sweet <eos> her ebon thighs , the wonder of my sight <eos> where all my senses with their objects meet <eos> i pass these sports , in secret that are best <eos> wherein my thoughts did seem alive to be <eos> we both did strive , and weary both did rest <eos> i kissed her still , and still she kiss è d me <eos> heavens , let me sleep , and shows my senses feed <eos> or let me wake and happy be indeed <eos>
what ! and shall we , with such submissive airs <eos> as age demands in reverence from the young <eos> await these crumbs of praise from europe flung <eos> and doubt of our own greatness till it bears <eos> the signet of your goethes or voltaires <eos> we who alone in latter times have sung <eos> with scarce less power than arno 's exiled tongue <eos> we who are milton 's kindred , shakespeare 's heirs <eos> the prize of lyric victory who shall gain <eos> if ours be not the laurel , ours the palm <eos> more than the froth and flotsam of the seine <eos> more than your hugo flare against the night <eos> and more than weimar 's proud elaborate calm <eos> one flash of byron 's lightning , wordsworth 's light <eos>
france , cloven in twain by fire of hell and hate <eos> shamed with the shame of men her meanest born <eos> soldier and judge whose names , inscribed for scorn <eos> stand vilest on the record writ of fate <eos> lies yet not wholly vile who stood so great <eos> sees yet not all her praise of old outworn <eos> not yet is all her scroll of glory torn <eos> or left for utter shame to desecrate <eos> high souls and constant hearts of faithful men <eos> sustain her perfect praise with tongue and pen <eos> indomitable as honour . storms may toss <eos> and soil her standard ere her bark win home <eos> but shame falls full upon the christless cross <eos> whose brandmark signs the holy hounds of rome <eos>
read in my face a volume of despairs <eos> the wailing iliads of my tragic woe <eos> drawn with my blood , and painted with my cares <eos> wrought by her hand that i have honoured so <eos> who whilst i burn , she sings at my soul 's wrack <eos> looking aloft from turret of her pride <eos> there my soul 's tyrant joys her in the sack <eos> of her own seat , whereof i made her guide <eos> there do these smokes that from affliction rise <eos> serve as an incense to a cruel dame <eos> a sacrifice thrice grateful to her eyes <eos> because their power serves to exact the same <eos> thus ruins she to satisfy her will <eos> the temple where her name was honoured still <eos>
let me confess that we two must be twain <eos> although our undivided loves are one <eos> so shall those blots that do with me remain <eos> without thy help , by me be borne alone <eos> in our two loves there is but one respect <eos> though in our lives a separable spite <eos> which though it alter not love 's sole effect <eos> yet doth it steal sweet hours from love 's delight <eos> i may not evermore acknowledge thee <eos> lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame <eos> nor thou with public kindness honour me <eos> unless thou take that honour from thy name <eos> but do not so , i love thee in such sort <eos> as thou being mine , mine is thy good report <eos>
upon a cloud among the stars we stood <eos> the angel raised his hand and looked and said <eos> “ which world , of all yon starry myriad <eos> shall we make wing to ? ” the still solitude <eos> became a harp whereon his voice and mood <eos> made spheral music round his haloed head <eos> i spake — for then i had not long been dead <eos> “ let me look round upon the vasts , and brood <eos> a moment on these orbs ere i decide <eos> what is yon lower star that beauteous shines <eos> and with soft splendor now incarnadines <eos> our wings ?— there would i go and there abide <eos> he smiled as one who some child 's thought divines <eos> “ that is the world where yesternight you died <eos>
i am a little world , made cunningly <eos> of elements and an angelic sprite <eos> but black sin hath betrayed to endless night <eos> my world 's both parts , and oh ! both parts must die <eos> you , which beyond that heaven , which was most high <eos> have found new spheres , and of new land can write <eos> pour new seas in mine eyes , that so i might <eos> drown my world with my weeping earnestly <eos> or wash it , if it must be drowned no more <eos> but oh ! it must be burnt ; alas ! the fire <eos> of lust and envy burnt it heretofore <eos> and made it fouler ; let their flames retire <eos> and burn me , o lord ! with a fiery zeal <eos> of thee and thy house , which doth in eating heal <eos>
then thus to phoebus , in the realms above <eos> spoke from his throne the cloud compelling jove <eos> “ descend , my phoebus ! on the phrygian plain <eos> and from the fight convey sarpedon slain <eos> then bathe his body in the crystal flood <eos> with dust dishonour ’ d , and deform ’ d with blood <eos> o ’ er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed <eos> and with celestial robes adorn the dead <eos> those rites discharged , his sacred corse bequeath <eos> to the soft arms of silent sleep and death <eos> they to his friends the immortal charge shall bear <eos> his friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear <eos> what honour mortals after death receive <eos> those unavailing honours we may give <eos>
between two seas the sea bird 's wing makes halt <eos> wind weary ; while with lifting head he waits <eos> for breath to reinspire him from the gates <eos> that open still toward sunrise on the vault <eos> high domed of morning , and in flight 's default <eos> with spreading sense of spirit anticipates <eos> what new sea now may lure beyond the straits <eos> his wings exulting that her winds exalt <eos> and fill them full as sails to seaward spread <eos> fulfilled with fair speed 's promise . pass , my song <eos> forth to the haven of thy desire and dread <eos> the presence of our lord , long loved and long <eos> far off above beholden , who to thee <eos> was as light kindling all a windy sea <eos>
the orient beam illumes the parting oar <eos> from yonder azure track , emerging white <eos> the earliest sail slow gains upon the sight <eos> and the blue wave comes rippling to the shore <eos> meantime far off the rear of darkness flies <eos> yet ‘ mid the beauties of the morn , unmoved <eos> like one for ever torn from all he loved <eos> back o'er the deep i turn my longing eyes <eos> and chide the wayward passions that rebel <eos> yet boots it not to think , or to complain <eos> musing sad ditties to the reckless main <eos> to dreams like these , adieu ! the pealing bell <eos> speaks of the hour that stays not — and the day <eos> to life 's sad turmoil calls my heart away <eos>
if the blinde furie which warres breedeth oft <eos> wonts not t'enrage the hearts of equall beasts <eos> whether they fare on foote , or flie aloft <eos> or armed be with clawes , or scalie creasts <eos> what fell erynnis , with hot burning tongs <eos> did grype your hearts with noysome rage imbew 'd <eos> that , each to other working cruell wrongs <eos> your blades in your owne bowels you embrew 'd <eos> was this , ye romanes , your hard destinie <eos> or some old sinne , whose unappeased guilt <eos> powr 'd vengeance forth on you eternallie <eos> or brothers blood , the which at first was spilt <eos> upon your walls , that god might not endure <eos> upon the same to set foundation sure <eos>
at sultry noon too , when our toils were done <eos> we to the gloomy glen were wont to run <eos> there on the turf we lay , while at our feet <eos> the cooling rivulet rippled softly sweet <eos> and mused on holy theme , and ancient lore <eos> of deeds , and days , and heroes now no more <eos> heard , as his solemn harp isaiah swept <eos> sung woe unto the wicked land — and wept <eos> or , fancy led , saw jeremiah mourn <eos> in solemn sorrow o'er judea 's urn <eos> then to another shore perhaps would rove <eos> with plato talk in his ilyssian grove <eos> or , wandering where the thespian palace rose <eos> weep once again o'er fair jocasta 's woes <eos>
if thou hadst been a sculptor , what a race <eos> of forms divine had thenceforth filled the land <eos> methinks i see thee , glorious workman , stand <eos> striking a marble window through blind space <eos> thy face 's reflex on the coming face <eos> as dawns the stone to statue ‘ neath thy hand <eos> body obedient to its soul 's command <eos> which is thy thought , informing it with grace <eos> so had it been . but god , who quickeneth clay <eos> nor turneth it to marble — maketh eyes <eos> not shadowy hollows , where no sunbeams play <eos> would mould his loftiest thought in human guise <eos> thou didst appear , walking unknown abroad <eos> god 's living sculpture , all informed of god <eos>
o ! it is pleasant , with a heart at ease <eos> just after sunset , or by moonlight skies <eos> to make the shifting clouds be what you please <eos> or let the easily persuaded eyes <eos> own each quaint likeness issuing from the mould <eos> of a friend 's fancy ; or with head bent low <eos> and cheek aslant see rivers flow of gold <eos> ‘ twixt crimson banks ; and then , a traveller , go <eos> from mount to mount through cloudland , gorgeous land <eos> or list'ning to the tide , with clos é d sight <eos> be that blind bard , who on the chian strand <eos> by those deep sounds possessed with inward light <eos> beheld the iliad and the odyssee <eos> rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea <eos>
those lines that i before have writ do lie <eos> even those that said i could not love you dearer <eos> yet then my judgment knew no reason why <eos> my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer <eos> but reckoning time , whose millioned accidents <eos> creep in ‘ twixt vows , and change decrees of kings <eos> tan sacred beauty , blunt the sharp'st intents <eos> divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things <eos> alas why fearing of time 's tyranny <eos> might i not then say ‘ now i love you best <eos> when i was certain o'er incertainty <eos> crowning the present , doubting of the rest <eos> love is a babe , then might i not say so <eos> to give full growth to that which still doth grow <eos>
no sooner on my vision streaming , smote <eos> the heav'nly influence , which years past , and e'en <eos> in childhood , thrill 'd me , than towards virgil i <eos> turn 'd me to leftward , panting , like a babe <eos> that flees for refuge to his mother 's breast <eos> if aught have terrified or work 'd him woe <eos> and would have cried : “ there is no dram of blood <eos> that doth not quiver in me . the old flame <eos> throws out clear tokens of reviving fire <eos> but virgil had bereav 'd us of himself <eos> virgil , my best lov 'd father ; virgil , he <eos> to whom i gave me up for safety : nor <eos> all , our prime mother lost , avail 'd to save <eos> my undew 'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears <eos>
o garden isle , beloved by sun and sea <eos> whose bluest billows kiss thy curving bays <eos> whose light infolds thy hills with golden rays <eos> filling with fruit each dark leaved orange tree <eos> what hidden hatred hath the earth for thee <eos> that once again , in these dark , dreadful days <eos> breaks forth in trembling rage , and swiftly lays <eos> thy beauty waste in wreck and agony <eos> is nature , then , a strife of jealous powers <eos> and man the plaything of unconscious fate <eos> not so , my troubled heart ! god reigns above <eos> and man is greatest in his darkest hours <eos> walking amid the cities desolate <eos> behold the son of god in human love <eos>
so in their hearts the nymphs spake : but they twain <eos> burned on the pyre , never to hail again <eos> the dayspring . wondering herdmen stood around <eos> as once the thronging argives marvelling saw <eos> evadne clasping mid the fire her lord <eos> capaneus , slain by zeus ’ dread thunderbolt <eos> but when the blast of the devouring fire <eos> had made twain one , oenone and paris , now <eos> one little heap of ashes , then with wine <eos> quenched they the embers , and they laid their bones <eos> in a wide golden vase , and round them piled <eos> the earth mound ; and they set two pillars there <eos> that each from other ever turn away <eos> for the old jealousy in the marble lives <eos>
oft as by chance , a little while apart <eos> the pall of empty , loveless hours withdrawn <eos> sweet beauty , opening on the impoverished heart <eos> beams like the jewel on the breast of dawn <eos> not though high heaven should rend would deeper awe <eos> fill me than penetrates my spirit thus <eos> nor all those signs the patmian prophet saw <eos> seem a new heaven and earth so marvelous <eos> but , clad thenceforth in iridescent dyes <eos> the fair world glistens , and in after days <eos> the memory of kind lips and laughing eyes <eos> lives in my step and lightens all my face <eos> so they who found the earthly paradise <eos> still breathed , returned , of that sweet , joyful place <eos>
“ i ceased , when affable the goddess cried <eos> ‘ observe , and in the truths i speak confide <eos> the oracular seer frequents the pharian coast <eos> from whose high bed my birth divine i boast <eos> proteus , a name tremendous o'er the main <eos> the delegate of neptune 's watery reign <eos> watch with insidious care his known abode <eos> there fast in chains constrain the various god <eos> who bound , obedient to superior force <eos> unerring will prescribe your destined course <eos> if , studious on your realms , you then demand <eos> their state , since last you left your natal land <eos> instant the god obsequious will disclose <eos> bright tracts of glory or a cloud of woes <eos>

“ long as ‘ t is lawful for me , shall my steps <eos> follow on thine ; and since the cloudy smoke <eos> forbids the seeing , hearing in its stead <eos> shall keep us join 'd . ” i then forthwith began <eos> “ yet in my mortal swathing , i ascend <eos> to higher regions , and am hither come <eos> through the fearful agony of hell <eos> and , if so largely god hath doled his grace <eos> that , clean beside all modern precedent <eos> he wills me to behold his kingly state <eos> from me conceal not who thou wast , ere death <eos> had loos 'd thee ; but instruct me : and instruct <eos> if rightly to the pass i tend ; thy words <eos> the way directing as a safe escort <eos>
“ o never , never more let king be just <eos> be mild in power , or faithful to his trust <eos> let tyrants govern with an iron rod <eos> oppress , destroy , and be the scourge of god <eos> since he who like a father held his reign <eos> so soon forgot , was just and mild in vain <eos> true , while my friend is grieved , his griefs i share <eos> yet now the rivals are my smallest care <eos> they for the mighty mischiefs they devise <eos> ere long shall pay — their forfeit lives the price <eos> but against you , ye greeks ! ye coward train <eos> gods ! how my soul is moved with just disdain <eos> dumb ye all stand , and not one tongue affords <eos> his injured prince the little aid of words <eos>
juno and pallas grieving hear the doom <eos> but feast their souls on ilion ’ s woes to come <eos> though secret anger swell ’ d minerva ’ s breast <eos> the prudent goddess yet her wrath repress ’ d <eos> but juno , impotent of rage , replies <eos> “ what hast thou said , o tyrant of the skies <eos> strength and omnipotence invest thy throne <eos> ’ tis thine to punish ; ours to grieve alone <eos> for greece we grieve , abandon ’ d by her fate <eos> to drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate <eos> from fields forbidden we submiss refrain <eos> with arms unaiding see our argives slain <eos> yet grant our counsels still their breasts may move <eos> lest all should perish in the rage of jove <eos>
now being on the eve of death , discharged <eos> from every mortal hope and earthly care <eos> i questioned how my soul might best employ <eos> this hand , and this still wakeful flame of mind <eos> in the brief hours yet left me for their use <eos> wherefore have i bethought me of my friend <eos> of you , philarchus , and your company <eos> yet wavering in the faith and unconfirmed <eos> perchance that i may break into thine heart <eos> some sorrowful channel for the love divine <eos> i make this simple record of our proof <eos> in diverse sufferings for the name of christ <eos> whereof the end already for the most <eos> is death this day with steadfast faith endured <eos>
such sympathies the glorious bard endear <eos> thus fair he walks in man 's diurnal sphere <eos> but when , upborne on bright invention 's wings <eos> he dares the realms of uncreated things <eos> forms more divine , more dreadful , start to view <eos> than ever hades or olympus knew <eos> round the dark cauldron , terrible and fell <eos> the midnight witches breathe the songs of hell <eos> delighted ariel wings his fiery way <eos> to whirl the storm , the wheeling orbs to stay <eos> then bathes in honey dews , and sleeps in flowers <eos> meanwhile , young oberon , girt with shadowy powers <eos> pursues o'er ocean 's verge the pale cold moon <eos> or hymns her , riding in her highest noon <eos>
tread softly ! all the earth is holy ground <eos> it may be , could we look with seeing eyes <eos> this spot we stand on is a paradise <eos> where dead have come to life and lost been found <eos> where faith has triumphed , martyrdom been crowned <eos> where fools have foiled the wisdom of the wise <eos> from this same spot the dust of saints may rise <eos> and the king 's prisoners come to light unbound <eos> o earth , earth , earth , hear thou thy maker 's word <eos> “ thy dead thou shalt give up , nor hide thy slain <eos> some who went weeping forth shall come again <eos> rejoicing from the east or from the west <eos> as doves fly to their windows , love 's own bird <eos> contented and desirous to the nest <eos>
he came , a youth , singing in the dawn <eos> of a new freedom , glowing o'er his lyre <eos> refining , as with great apollo 's fire <eos> his people 's gift of song . and thereupon <eos> this negro singer , come to helicon <eos> constrained the masters , listening to admire <eos> and roused a race to wonder and aspire <eos> gazing which way their honest voice was gone <eos> with ebon face uplit of glory 's crest <eos> men marveled at the singer , strong and sweet <eos> who brought the cabin 's mirth , the tuneful night <eos> but faced the morning , beautiful with light <eos> to die while shadows yet fell toward the west <eos> and leave his laurels at his people 's feet <eos>

he spoke ; when behren 's pass before them lay <eos> and moving nations on the margin stray <eos> thick swarming , venturous ; sail and oar they ply <eos> climb on the surge and o'er the billows fly <eos> as when autumnal storms awake their force <eos> the storks foreboding tempt their southern course <eos> from all the fields collecting throngs arise <eos> mount on the wing and crowd along the skies <eos> thus , to his eye , from bleak tartaria 's shore <eos> thro isles and seas , the gathering people pour <eos> change their cold regions for a happier strand <eos> leap from the wave and tread the welcome land <eos> in growing tribes extend their southern sway <eos> and wander wide beneath a warmer day <eos>
is it your heart i hear beneath me <eos> or the far tolling of that tower <eos> the voices are still that cried around us <eos> the woods grow still for the sacred hour <eos> rise , white lover ! the day draws near <eos> the grey trees lean to the east in fear <eos> ‘ by the clear waters where once i died <eos> beloved , whose voice was this that cried <eos> ‘ by the clear waters that reach the sun <eos> by the clear waves that starward run <eos> i found love 's body and lost his soul <eos> and crumbled in flame that should have annealed <eos> how shall i ever again be whole <eos> by what dark waters shall i be healed <eos>
he saw at once , as far as eye could rove <eos> like scattering herds , the swarthy people move <eos> in tribes innumerable ; all the waste <eos> wide as their walks , a varying shadow cast <eos> as airy shapes , beneath the moon 's pale eye <eos> people the clouds that sail the midnight sky <eos> dance thro the grove and flit along the glade <eos> and cast their grisly phantoms on the shade <eos> so move the hordes , in thickets half conceal 'd <eos> or vagrant stalking thro the fenceless field <eos> here tribes untamed , who scorn to fix their home <eos> o'er shadowy streams and trackless deserts roam <eos> while others there in settled hamlets rest <eos> and corn clad vales a happier state attest <eos>
two loves i have , of comfort and despair <eos> that like two spirits do suggest me still <eos> my better angel is a man right fair <eos> my worser spirit a woman colour 'd ill <eos> to win me soon to hell , my female evil <eos> tempteth my better angel from my side <eos> and would corrupt my saint to be a devil <eos> wooing his purity with her fair pride <eos> and whether that my angel be turn 'd fiend <eos> suspect i may , yet not directly tell <eos> for being both to me , both to each friend <eos> i guess one angel in another 's hell <eos> the truth i shall not know , but live in doubt <eos> till my bad angel fire my good one out <eos>
stabb ’ d at the sight , deiphobus drew nigh <eos> and made , with force , the vengeful weapon fly <eos> the cretan saw ; and , stooping , caused to glance <eos> from his slope shield the disappointed lance <eos> beneath the spacious targe , ( a blazing round <eos> thick with bull hides and brazen orbits bound <eos> on his raised arm by two strong braces stay ’ d <eos> he lay collected in defensive shade <eos> o ’ er his safe head the javelin idly sung <eos> and on the tinkling verge more faintly rung <eos> even then the spear the vigorous arm confess ’ d <eos> and pierced , obliquely , king hypsenor ’ s breast <eos> warm ’ d in his liver , to the ground it bore <eos> the chief , his people ’ s guardian now no more <eos>
o nothing , in this corporal earth of man <eos> that to the imminent heaven of his high soul <eos> responds with colour and with shadow , can <eos> lack correlated greatness . if the scroll <eos> where thoughts lie fast in spell of hieroglyph <eos> be mighty through its mighty habitants <eos> if god be in his name ; grave potence if <eos> the sounds unbind of hieratic chants <eos> all 's vast that vastness means . nay , i affirm <eos> nature is whole in her least things exprest <eos> nor know we with what scope god builds the worm <eos> our towns are copied fragments from our breast <eos> and all man 's babylons strive but to impart <eos> the grandeurs of his babylonian heart <eos>
nay , we are children : we will not mature <eos> a blessed gift must seem a theft ; and tears <eos> must storm our eyes when but a joy appears <eos> in drear disguise of sorrow ; and how poor <eos> we seem when we are richest ,— most secure <eos> against all poverty the lifelong years <eos> we yet must waste in childish doubts and fears <eos> that , in despite of reason , still endure <eos> alas ! the sermon of the rose we will <eos> not wisely ponder ; nor the sobs of grief <eos> lulled into sighs of rapture ; nor the cry <eos> of fierce defiance that again is still <eos> be patient — patient with our frail belief <eos> and stay it yet a little ere we die <eos>
in this dark age tho blinded faction sways <eos> and wealth and conquest gain the palm of praise <eos> awed into slaves while groveling millions groan <eos> and blood stain 'd steps lead upward to a throne <eos> far other wreaths thy virtuous temples twine <eos> far nobler triumphs crown a life like thine <eos> thine be the joys that minds immortal grace <eos> as thine the deeds that bless a kindred race <eos> now raise thy sorrowed soul to views more bright <eos> the vision 'd ages rushing on thy sight <eos> worlds beyond worlds shall bring to light their stores <eos> time , nature , science blend their utmost powers <eos> to show , concentred in one blaze of fame <eos> the ungather 'd glories that await thy name <eos>
those snary locks are those same nets , my dear <eos> wherewith my liberty thou didst surprise <eos> love was the flame that fir è d me so near <eos> the dart transpiercing were those crystal eyes <eos> strong is the net , and fervent is the flame <eos> deep is the wound my sighs can well report <eos> yet i do love , adore , and praise the same <eos> that holds , that burns , that wounds in this sort <eos> and list not seek to break , to quench , to heal <eos> the bond , the flame , the wound that festereth so <eos> by knife , by liquor , or by salve to deal <eos> so much i please to perish in my woe <eos> yet lest long travails be above my strength <eos> good delia , loose , quench , heal me , now at length <eos>
father , part of his double interest <eos> unto thy kingdom thy son gives to me <eos> his jointure in the knotty trinity <eos> he keeps , and gives to me his death 's conquest <eos> this lamb , whose death with life the world hath blest <eos> was from the world 's beginning slain , and he <eos> hath made two wills , which , with the legacy <eos> of his and thy kingdom , thy sons invest <eos> yet such are these laws , that men argue yet <eos> whether a man those statutes can fulfil <eos> none doth ; but thy all healing grace and spirit <eos> revive again what law and letter kill <eos> thy law 's abridgment and thy last command <eos> is all but love ; oh , let this last will stand <eos>
cloud topped and splendid , dominating all <eos> the little lesser hills which compass thee <eos> thou standest , bright with april 's buoyancy <eos> yet holding winter in some shaded wall <eos> of stern , steep rock ; and startled by the call <eos> of spring , thy trees flush with expectancy <eos> and cast a cloud of crimson , silently <eos> above thy snowy crevices where fall <eos> pale shrivelled oak leaves , while the snow beneath <eos> melts at their phantom touch . another year <eos> is quick with import . such each year has been <eos> unmoved thou watchest all , and all bequeath <eos> some jewel to thy diadem of power <eos> thou pledge of greater majesty unseen <eos>
you , meanwhile , where drenched you stand <eos> awaken once more to the rush and roar <eos> and on the rock point tighten your hand <eos> as you turn and see a valley deep <eos> that was not there a moment before <eos> suck rattling down between you and a heap <eos> of toppling billow , whose instant fall <eos> must sink the whole island once for all <eos> or watch the silenter , stealthier seas <eos> feeling their way to you more and more <eos> if they once should clutch you high as the knees <eos> they would whirl you down like a sprig of kelp <eos> beyond all reach of hope or help <eos> and such in a storm is appledore <eos>
my lady 's presence makes the roses red <eos> because to see her lips they blush with shame <eos> the lily 's leaves for envy pale became <eos> and her white hands in them this envy bred <eos> the marigold the leaves abroad doth spread <eos> because the sun 's and her power is the same <eos> the violet of purple colour came <eos> dyed in the blood she made my heart to shed <eos> in brief , all flowers from her their virtue take <eos> from her sweet breath their sweet smells do proceed <eos> the living heat which her eyebeams doth make <eos> warmeth the ground and quickeneth the seed <eos> the rain wherewith she watereth the flowers <eos> falls from mine eyes which she dissolves in showers <eos>
lady of ladies , the delight alone <eos> for which to heaven earth doth no envy bear <eos> seeing and hearing thee , we see and hear <eos> such voice , such light , as never sung nor shone <eos> the want of heaven i grant yet we may moan <eos> not for the pleasure of the angels there <eos> as though in face or voice they like thee were <eos> but that they many be , and thou but one <eos> the basest notes which from thy voice proceed <eos> the treble of the angels do exceed <eos> so that i fear their choir to beautify <eos> lest thou to some in heaven shall sing and shine <eos> lo , when i hear thee sing , the reason why <eos> sighs of my breast keep time with notes of thine <eos>
witless of this sad deed , and absent far <eos> fierce meleager , with the self same fire <eos> burn 'd inward ; all his vitals felt the flame <eos> scorching conceal 'd : th ’ excruciating pangs <eos> magnanimous he bore . yet deep he mourn 'd <eos> by such a slothful bloodless fate to fall <eos> and happy call 'd anc æ us in his wounds <eos> with deep drawn groans he calls his aged sire <eos> his brother , sisters , and the nymph belov 'd <eos> who shar 'd his nuptial couch ; with final breath <eos> his mother too perchance . now glows the fire <eos> and now the pains increase ; now both are faint <eos> now both together die . the soul flies forth <eos> and gently dissipates in empty air <eos>
keen , fitful gusts are whisp'ring here and there <eos> among the bushes half leafless , and dry <eos> the stars look very cold about the sky <eos> and i have many miles on foot to fare <eos> yet feel i little of the cool bleak air <eos> or of the dead leaves rustling drearily <eos> or of those silver lamps that burn on high <eos> or of the distance from home 's pleasant lair <eos> for i am brimfull of the friendliness <eos> that in a little cottage i have found <eos> of fair hair 'd milton 's eloquent distress <eos> and all his love for gentle lycid drown 'd <eos> of lovely laura in her light green dress <eos> and faithful petrarch gloriously crown 'd <eos>
“ the two beloved ones left alone , each day <eos> grieved more and more until in peace at last <eos> the bounding line of life was safely past <eos> and all their sorrow then was put away <eos> they pined in vain for that dear birdling flown <eos> who , with swift wings had left them there alone <eos> yet oft in gentle tones they spoke of thee <eos> and longed they fair , young face once more to see <eos> unto our far off shore there sometimes came <eos> faint rumors of thy longed for , new found fame <eos> this gave them joy indeed , yet more of pain <eos> for thus they knew their hopes were all in vain <eos> allured unto the world was thy young heart <eos> the gay , bright world in which they had no part <eos>
o friend ! i know not which way i must look <eos> for comfort , being , as i am , opprest <eos> to think that now our life is only drest <eos> for shew ; mean handywork of craftsman , cook <eos> or groom ! we must run glittering like a brook <eos> in the open sunshine , or we are unblest <eos> the wealthiest man among us is the best <eos> no grandeur now in nature or in book <eos> delights us . rapine , avarice , expence <eos> this is idolatry ; and these we adore <eos> plain living and high thinking are no more <eos> the homely beauty of the good old cause <eos> is gone ; our peace , our fearful innocence <eos> and pure religion breathing household laws <eos>

when garry , who had stanched his wounds , arose <eos> he seized his axe , and ‘ gan with rapid blows <eos> to fell down fir trees . through the silent strath <eos> the hollow echoes rang . with fiendish wrath <eos> he made resolve to heap the splintered wood <eos> against the door , and burn the hated brood <eos> of his tormentors one and all . he hewed <eos> an ample pyre , then piled it thick and high <eos> while the sun , sloping to the western sky <eos> proclaimed the closing of that fateful day <eos> but the doomed women little dreamed that they <eos> would have such fearsome end ... as garry lay <eos> rubbing the firesticks till they ‘ gan to glow <eos> he heard a fian mother singing low <eos>
these words were thunder to belphegor 's ears <eos> who instantly took flight , so great his fears <eos> to hell 's abyss he fled without delay <eos> to tell adventures through the realms of day <eos> sire , said the demon , it is clearly true <eos> damnation does the marriage knot pursue <eos> your highness often hither sees arrive <eos> not squads , but regiments , who , when alive <eos> by hymen were indissolubly tied <eos> in person i the fact have fully tried <eos> th ’ institution , perhaps , most just could be <eos> past ages far more happiness might see <eos> but ev'ry thing , with time , corruption shows <eos> no jewel in your crown more lustre throws <eos>
i met thee like the morning , though more fair <eos> and hopes ‘ gan travel for a glorious day <eos> and though night met them ere they were aware <eos> leading the joyous pilgrims all astray <eos> yet know i not , though they did miss their way <eos> that joyed so much to meet thee , if they are <eos> to blame or bless the fate that bade such be <eos> thou seem'dst an angel when i met thee first <eos> nor has aught made thee otherwise to me <eos> possession has not cloyed my love , nor curst <eos> fancy 's wild visions with reality <eos> thou art an angel still ; and hope , awoke <eos> from the fond spell that early raptures nurst <eos> still feels a joy to think that spell ne'er broke <eos>
alaciel 's story 's of another kind <eos> and i 've a little altered it , you 'll find <eos> faults some may see , and others disbelieve <eos> ‘ tis all the same :— ‘ twill never make me grieve <eos> alaciel 's mem'ry , it is very clear <eos> can scarcely by it lose ; there 's naught to fear <eos> two facts important i have kept in view <eos> in which the author fully i pursue <eos> the one — no less than eight the belle possessed <eos> before a husband 's sight her eyes had blessed <eos> the other is , the prince she was to wed <eos> ne'er seemed to heed this trespass on his bed <eos> but thought , perhaps , the beauty she had got <eos> would prove to any one a happy lot <eos>
when old jack died , we stayed from school ( they said <eos> at home , we need n't go that day ) , and none <eos> of us ate any breakfast — only one <eos> and that was papa — and his eyes were red <eos> when he came round where we were , by the shed <eos> where jack was lying , half way in the sun <eos> and half way in the shade . when we begun <eos> to cry out loud , pa turned and dropped his head <eos> and went away ; and mamma , she went back <eos> into the kitchen . then , for a long while <eos> all to ourselves , like , we stood there and cried <eos> we thought so many good things of old jack <eos> and funny things — although we did n't smile <eos> we could n't only cry when old jack died <eos>
outwearied with the littleness and spite <eos> the falsehood and the treachery of men <eos> i cried , “ give me but justice ! ” thinking then <eos> i meekly craved a common boon which might <eos> most easily be granted ; soon the light <eos> of deeper truth grew on my wondering ken <eos> ( escaping baneful damps of stagnant fen <eos> and then i saw that in my pride bedight <eos> i claimed from erring man the gift of heaven <eos> god 's own great vested right ; and i grew calm <eos> with folded hands , like stone , to patience given <eos> and pitying , of pure love distilling balm <eos> and now i wait in quiet trust to be <eos> all known to god — and ask of men sweet charity <eos>
poet of nature , thou hast wept to know <eos> that things depart which never may return <eos> childhood and youth , friendship and love 's first glow <eos> have fled like sweet dreams , leaving thee to mourn <eos> these common woes i feel . one loss is mine <eos> which thou too feel'st , yet i alone deplore <eos> thou wert as a lone star , whose light did shine <eos> on some frail bark in winter 's midnight roar <eos> thou hast like to a rock built refuge stood <eos> above the blind and battling multitude <eos> in honoured poverty thy voice did weave <eos> songs consecrate to truth and liberty <eos> deserting these , thou leavest me to grieve <eos> thus having been , that thou shouldst cease to be <eos>
and now the board was laid and dressed , and all <eos> sat down to dinner at the baron 's call <eos> and gawayne looked along the room askance <eos> seeking the lady ; and he caught one glance <eos> of laughing eyes — then looked away in haste <eos> but turned again , and wondered why his taste <eos> had erred so strangely , for the lady seemed <eos> not fairer now than others . had he dreamed <eos> he rubbed his eyes and pondered ,— though in sooth <eos> without one glimmering presage of the truth <eos> till all passed lightly from his puzzled mind <eos> leaving contentment and good cheer behind <eos> so all the company feasted well , and sped <eos> the flying hours , till it was time for bed <eos>

man 's heart may change , but nature 's glory never <eos> strange features throng around me , and the shore <eos> is not my own dear land . yet why deplore <eos> this change of doom ? all mortal ties must sever <eos> the pang is past ,— and now with blest endeavour <eos> i check the ready tear , the rising sigh <eos> the common earth is here — the common sky <eos> the common father . and how high soever <eos> o'er other tribes proud england 's hosts may seem <eos> god 's children , fair or sable , equal find <eos> a father 's love . then learn , o man , to deem <eos> all difference idle save of heart or mind <eos> thy duty , love — each cause of strife , a dream <eos> thy home , the world — thy family , mankind <eos>
when younglings first on cupid fix their sight <eos> and see him naked , blindfold , and a boy <eos> though bow and shafts and firebrand be his might <eos> yet ween they he can work them none annoy <eos> and therefore with his purple wings they play <eos> for glorious seemeth love though light as feather <eos> and when they have done they ween to scape away <eos> for blind men , say they , shoot they know not whither <eos> but when by proof they find that he did see <eos> and that his wound did rather dim their sight <eos> they wonder more how such a lad as he <eos> should be of such surpassing power and might <eos> but ants have galls , so hath the bee his sting <eos> then shield me , heavens , from such a subtle thing <eos>
the evening shines in may 's luxuriant pride <eos> and all the sunny hills at distance glow <eos> and all the brooks , that thro ’ the valley flow <eos> seem liquid gold .— o ! had my fate denied <eos> leisure , and power to taste the sweets that glide <eos> thro ’ waken 'd minds , as the soft seasons go <eos> on their still varying progress , for the woe <eos> my heart has felt , what balm had been supplied <eos> but where great nature smiles , as here she smiles <eos> ‘ mid verdant vales , and gently swelling hills <eos> and glassy lakes , and mazy , murmuring rills <eos> and narrow wood wild lanes , her spell beguiles <eos> th ’ impatient sighs of grief , and reconciles <eos> poetic minds to life , with all her ills <eos>
the castle gate stands open now <eos> and the wanderer is welcome to the hall <eos> as the hang bird is to the elm tree bough <eos> no longer scowl the turrets tall <eos> the summer 's long siege at last is o'er <eos> when the first poor outcast went in at the door <eos> she entered with him in disguise <eos> and mastered the fortress by surprise <eos> there is no spot she loves so well on ground <eos> she lingers and smiles there the whole year round <eos> the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land <eos> has hall and bower at his command <eos> and there 's no poor man in the north countree <eos> but is lord of the earldom as much as he <eos>

lady ! the songs of spring were in the grove <eos> while i was framing beds for winter flowers <eos> while i was planting green unfading bowers <eos> and shrubs to hang upon the warm alcove <eos> and sheltering wall ; and still , as fancy wove <eos> the dream , to time and nature 's blended powers <eos> i gave this paradise for winter hours <eos> a labyrinth lady ! which your feet shall rove <eos> yes ! when the sun of life more feebly shines <eos> becoming thoughts , i trust , of solemn gloom <eos> or of high gladness you shall hither bring <eos> and these perennial bowers and murmuring pines <eos> be gracious as the music and the bloom <eos> and all the mighty ravishment of spring <eos>
long dwelt his eye where these commingling pour 'd <eos> their waves unkeel 'd , their havens unexplored <eos> where frowning forests stretch the dusky wing <eos> and deadly damps forbid the flowers to spring <eos> no seasons clothe the field with cultured grain <eos> no buoyant ship attempts the chartless main <eos> then with impatient voice : my seer , he cried <eos> when shall my children cross the lonely tide <eos> here , here my sons , the hand of culture bring <eos> here teach the lawn to smile , the grove to sing <eos> ye laboring floods , no longer vainly glide <eos> ye harvests load them , and ye forests ride <eos> bear the deep burden from the joyous swain <eos> and tell the world where peace and plenty reign <eos>
o death , a little more , and then the worm <eos> a little longer , o death , a little yet <eos> before the grave gape and the grave worm fret <eos> before the sanguine spotted hand infirm <eos> be rottenness , and that foul brain , the germ <eos> of all ill things and thoughts , be stopped and set <eos> a little while , o death , ere he forget <eos> a small space more of life , a little term <eos> a little longer ere he and thou be met <eos> ere in that hand that fed thee to thy mind <eos> the poison cup of life be overset <eos> a little respite of disastrous breath <eos> till the soul lift up her lost eyes , and find <eos> nor god nor help nor hope , but thee , o death <eos>
no ! time , thou shalt not boast that i do change <eos> thy pyramids built up with newer might <eos> to me are nothing novel , nothing strange <eos> they are but dressings of a former sight <eos> our dates are brief , and therefore we admire <eos> what thou dost foist upon us that is old <eos> and rather make them born to our desire <eos> than think that we before have heard them told <eos> thy registers and thee i both defy <eos> not wond'ring at the present , nor the past <eos> for thy records , and what we see doth lie <eos> made more or less by thy continual haste <eos> this i do vow and this shall ever be <eos> i will be true despite thy scythe and thee <eos>
now that we 've done our best and worst , and parted <eos> i would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend <eos> ( o heart , i do not dare go empty hearted <eos> i 'll think of love in books , love without end <eos> women with child , content ; and old men sleeping <eos> and wet strong ploughlands , scarred for certain grain <eos> and babes that weep , and so forget their weeping <eos> and the young heavens , forgetful after rain <eos> and evening hush , broken by homing wings <eos> and song 's nobility , and wisdom holy <eos> that live , we dead . i would think of a thousand things <eos> lovely and durable , and taste them slowly <eos> one after one , like tasting a sweet food <eos> i have need to busy my heart with quietude <eos>
and the king said , “ well , we are stony broke <eos> but the queen could not see it was much of a joke <eos> and she said , “ if the metal is all used up <eos> pray what of the costume i want for the cup <eos> it all seems so dreadfully simple to me <eos> the stones ? why , import them from over the sea <eos> but a glug stood up with a mole on his chin <eos> and said , with a most diabolical grin <eos> “ your majesties , down in the country of podge <eos> a spy has discovered a very ‘ cute dodge <eos> and the ogs are determined to wage a war <eos> on gosh , next friday , at half past four <eos> then the glugs all cried , in a terrible fright <eos> “ how did our grandfathers manage a fight <eos>

because thou hast the power and own'st the grace <eos> to look through and behind this mask of me <eos> ( against which , years have beat thus blanchingly <eos> with their rains ,) and behold my soul 's true face <eos> the dim and weary witness of life 's race <eos> because thou hast the faith and love to see <eos> through that same soul 's distracting lethargy <eos> the patient angel waiting for a place <eos> in the new heavens ,— because nor sin nor woe <eos> nor god 's infliction , nor death 's neighbourhood <eos> nor all which others viewing , turn to go <eos> nor all which makes me tired of all , self viewed <eos> nothing repels thee , . . . dearest , teach me so <eos> to pour out gratitude , as thou dost , good <eos>
forget the past and live the present hour <eos> now is the time to work , the time to fill <eos> the soul with noblest thoughts , the time to will <eos> heroic deeds , to use whatever dower <eos> heaven has bestowed , to test our utmost power <eos> now is the time to live , and , better still <eos> to serve our loved ones ; over passing ill <eos> to rise triumphant ; thus the perfect flower <eos> of life shall come to fruitage ; wealth amass <eos> for grandest giving ere the time be gone <eos> be glad to day — to morrow may bring tears <eos> be brave to day ; the darkest night will pass <eos> and golden days will usher in the dawn <eos> who conquers now shall rule the coming years <eos>

no more their snowy flocks shall shepherds lead <eos> by babel 's silver stream and fertile mead <eos> or peasant girls at summer 's eve repair <eos> to wreathe with wilding flowers their flowing hair <eos> or pour their plaintive ditties to the wave <eos> that rolls its sullen murmurs o'er thy grave <eos> the wandering arab there no rest shall find <eos> but , starting , listen to the hollow wind <eos> that howls , prophetic , through thy ruined halls <eos> and flee in haste from thy accursed walls <eos> oh babylon , with wrath encompassed round <eos> for thee no hope , no mercy , shall be found <eos> thy doom is sealed — e'en to thy ruin clings <eos> the awful sentence of the king of kings <eos>

i met a traveller from an antique land <eos> who said : two vast and trunkless legs of stone <eos> stand in the desert ... near them , on the sand <eos> half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown <eos> and wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command <eos> tell that its sculptor well those passions read <eos> which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things <eos> the hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed <eos> and on the pedestal these words appear <eos> ‘ my name is ozymandias , king of kings <eos> look on my works , ye mighty , and despair <eos> nothing beside remains . round the decay <eos> of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare <eos> the lone and level sands stretch far away <eos>
the world was in its day of peril dark <eos> wont to believe the dotage of fond love <eos> from the fair cyprian deity , who rolls <eos> in her third epicycle , shed on men <eos> by stream of potent radiance : therefore they <eos> of elder time , in their old error blind <eos> not her alone with sacrifice ador 'd <eos> and invocation , but like honours paid <eos> to cupid and dione , deem 'd of them <eos> her mother , and her son , him whom they feign 'd <eos> to sit in dido 's bosom : and from her <eos> whom i have sung preluding , borrow 'd they <eos> the appellation of that star , which views <eos> now obvious and now averse , the sun <eos>
howe'er this fair , amid adventures dire <eos> more sufferings shared than malice could desire <eos> though eight times , doubtless , she exchanged her knight <eos> no proof , that she her spouse was led to slight <eos> ‘ twas gratitude , compassion , or good will <eos> the dread of worse ;— she 'd truly had her fill <eos> excuses just , to vindicate her fame <eos> who , spite of troubles , fanned the monarch 's flame <eos> of eight the relict , still a maid received <eos> apparently , the prince her pure believed <eos> for , though at times we may be duped in this <eos> yet , after such a number — strange to miss <eos> and i submit to those who 've passed the scene <eos> if they , to my opinion , do not lean <eos>
first time he kissed me , he but only kissed <eos> the fingers of this hand wherewith i write <eos> and ever since , it grew more clean and white <eos> slow to world greetings , quick with its “ o , list <eos> when the angels speak . a ring of amethyst <eos> i could not wear here , plainer to my sight <eos> than that first kiss . the second passed in height <eos> the first , and sought the forehead , and half missed <eos> half falling on the hair . o beyond meed <eos> that was the chrism of love , which love 's own crown <eos> with sanctifying sweetness , did precede <eos> the third upon my lips was folded down <eos> in perfect , purple state ; since when , indeed <eos> i have been proud and said , “ my love , my own <eos>
this dreadful combat great epeus chose <eos> high o ’ er the crowd , enormous bulk ! he rose <eos> and seized the beast , and thus began to say <eos> “ stand forth some man , to bear the bowl away <eos> ( price of his ruin : for who dares deny <eos> this mule my right ; the undoubted victor i <eos> others , ’ tis own ’ d , in fields of battle shine <eos> but the first honours of this fight are mine <eos> for who excels in all ? then let my foe <eos> draw near , but first his certain fortune know <eos> secure this hand shall his whole frame confound <eos> mash all his bones , and all his body pound <eos> so let his friends be nigh , a needful train <eos> to heave the batter ’ d carcase off the plain <eos>
with that the chief the tender victims slew <eos> and in the dust their bleeding bodies threw <eos> the vital spirit issued at the wound <eos> and left the members quivering on the ground <eos> from the same urn they drink the mingled wine <eos> and add libations to the powers divine <eos> while thus their prayers united mount the sky <eos> “ hear , mighty jove ! and hear , ye gods on high <eos> and may their blood , who first the league confound <eos> shed like this wine , disdain the thirsty ground <eos> may all their consorts serve promiscuous lust <eos> and all their lust be scatter ’ d as the dust <eos> thus either host their imprecations join ’ d <eos> which jove refused , and mingled with the wind <eos>
the palmer bent , with locks of silver gray <eos> quits the sweet spot where he has pass 'd his years <eos> quits his poor family , whose anxious fears <eos> paint the loved father fainting on his way <eos> and trembling , on his aged limbs slow borne <eos> in these last days that close his earthly course <eos> he , in his soul 's strong purpose , finds new force <eos> though weak with age , though by long travel worn <eos> thus reaching rome , led on by pious love <eos> he seeks the image of that saviour lord <eos> whom soon he hopes to meet in bliss above <eos> so , oft in other forms i seek to trace <eos> some charm , that to my heart may yet afford <eos> a faint resemblance of thy matchless grace <eos>
great hearted brother to the wilderness <eos> comrade of wind and sea ! interpreter <eos> of nomad nature ! ere the quick'ning stir <eos> of spring sap thrills the wood from sullen stress <eos> of winter 's spell — away from throng è d press <eos> of urban ways thy wild feet wander far <eos> tracking the steps of some white northern star <eos> whose rays are beacon to thy restlessness <eos> weird mystic of the northland 's mystery <eos> thou ‘ front'st the unseen shadow , nor dost fear <eos> to meet the scarlet hunter on the trail <eos> pagan as pan ; to all things sylvan dear <eos> nature 's own vagrant , buoyant , driftless , free <eos> all winds and woods and waters cry thee hail <eos>
the hills more glorious in their coat of snow <eos> rise all around him , in the valleys run <eos> bright streams , and there are lakes that catch the sun <eos> and sunlit fields of emerald far below <eos> that seem alive with inward light . in smoke <eos> the far horizons fade ; and there is peace <eos> on everything , a sense of blessed release <eos> from wilful strife . like some prophetic cloak <eos> the spirit of the mountains has descended <eos> on all the world , and its unrest is ended <eos> even the sea , glimpsed far away , seems still <eos> hushed to a silver peace its storm and strife <eos> mountains of vision , calm above fate and will <eos> you hold the promise of the freer life <eos>
sometimes we feel so spent for want of rest <eos> we have no thought beyond . i know to day <eos> when tired of bitter lips and dull delay <eos> with faithless words , i cast mine eyes upon <eos> the shadows of a distant mountain crest <eos> and said “ that hill must hide within its breast <eos> some secret glen secluded from the sun <eos> oh , mother nature ! would that i could run <eos> outside to thee ; and , like a wearied guest <eos> half blind with lamps , and sick of feasting , lay <eos> an aching head on thee . then down the streams <eos> the moon might swim , and i should feel her grace <eos> while soft winds blew the sorrows from my face <eos> so quiet in the fellowship of dreams <eos>
england , i stand on thy imperial ground <eos> not all a stranger ; as thy bugles blow <eos> i feel within my blood old battles flow <eos> the blood whose ancient founts in thee are found <eos> still surging dark against the christian bound <eos> wide islam presses ; well its peoples know <eos> thy heights that watch them wandering below <eos> i think how lucknow heard their gathering sound <eos> i turn , and meet the cruel , turbaned face <eos> england , ‘ t is sweet to be so much thy son <eos> i feel the conqueror in my blood and race <eos> last night trafalgar awed me , and to day <eos> gibraltar wakened ; hark , thy evening gun <eos> startles the desert over africa <eos>
sheath 'd is the river as it glideth by <eos> frost pearl 'd are all the boughs of forests old <eos> the sheep are huddling close upon the wold <eos> and over them the stars tremble on high <eos> pure joys these winter nights around me lie <eos> ‘ tis fine to loiter through the lighted streets <eos> at christmas time , and guess from brow and pace <eos> the doom and history of each one we meet <eos> what kind of heart beats in each dusky case <eos> whiles , startled by the beauty of a face <eos> in a shop light a moment . or instead <eos> to dream of silent fields where calm and deep <eos> the sunshine lieth like a golden sleep <eos> recalling sweetest looks of summers dead <eos>
into the golden vessel of great song <eos> let us pour all our passion ; breast to breast <eos> let other lovers lie , in love and rest <eos> not we ,— articulate , so , but with the tongue <eos> of all the world : the churning blood , the long <eos> shuddering quiet , the desperate hot palms pressed <eos> sharply together upon the escaping guest <eos> the common soul , unguarded , and grown strong <eos> longing alone is singer to the lute <eos> let still on nettles in the open sigh <eos> the minstrel , that in slumber is as mute <eos> as any man , and love be far and high <eos> that else forsakes the topmost branch , a fruit <eos> found on the ground by every passer by <eos>
now , now i love indeed , and suffer more <eos> in one day now then i did in a year <eos> great flames they be which but small sparkles were <eos> and wounded now , i was but pricked before <eos> no marvel then , though more than heretofore <eos> i weep and sigh ; how can great wounds be there <eos> where moisture runs not out ? and ever , where <eos> the fire is great , of smoke there must be store <eos> my heart was hitherto but like green wood <eos> which must be dried before it will burn bright <eos> my former love served but my heart to dry <eos> now cupid for his fire doth find it good <eos> for now it burneth clear , and shall give light <eos> for all the world your beauty to espy <eos>
like a bad suitor desperate and trembling <eos> from the mixed sense of being not loved and loving <eos> who with feared longing half would know , dissembling <eos> with what he ’ d wish proved what he fears soon proving <eos> i look with inner eyes afraid to look <eos> yet perplexed into looking , at the worth <eos> this verse may have and wonder , of my book <eos> to what thoughts shall ’ t in alien hearts give birth <eos> but , as he who doth love , and , loving , hopes <eos> yet , hoping , fears , fears to put proof to proof <eos> and in his mind for possible proofs gropes <eos> delaying the true proof , lest the real thing scoff <eos> i daily live , i ’ th ’ fame i dream to see <eos> but by my thought of others ’ thought of me <eos>
and while he won the world for her domain <eos> her loins brought forth , her fostering bosom fed <eos> souls that have swept the spiritual seas <eos> from heaven to hell , and justified her crown <eos> for round the throne of great elizabeth <eos> spenser and burleigh , sidney and verulam <eos> clustered like stars , rare jonson like the crown <eos> of cassiopeia , marlowe ruddy as mars <eos> and over all those mighty hearts arose <eos> the soul of shakespeare brooding far and wide <eos> beyond our small horizons , like a light <eos> thrown from a vaster sun that still illumes <eos> tracts which the arc of our increasing day <eos> must still leave undiscovered , unexplored <eos>
therefore i trust , although to outward sense <eos> both true and false seem shaken ; i will hold <eos> with newer light my reverence for the old <eos> and calmly wait the births of providence <eos> no gain is lost ; the clear eyed saints look down <eos> untroubled on the wreck of schemes and creeds <eos> love yet remains , its rosary of good deeds <eos> counting in task field and o'erpeopled town <eos> truth has charmed life ; the inward word survives <eos> and , day by day , its revelation brings <eos> faith , hope , and charity , whatsoever things <eos> which cannot be shaken , stand . still holy lives <eos> reveal the christ of whom the letter told <eos> and the new gospel verifies the old <eos>
to thee , dear god of mercy , both appeal <eos> who straightway sound the call to arms . thou know'st <eos> and that black spot in each embattled host <eos> spring of the blood stream , later wilt reveal <eos> now is it red artillery and white steel <eos> till on a day will ring the victor 's boast <eos> that ‘ tis thy chosen towers uppermost <eos> where thy rejected grovels under heel <eos> so in all times of man 's descent insane <eos> to brute , did strength and craft combining strike <eos> even as a god of armies , his fell blow <eos> but at the close he entered thy domain <eos> dear god of mercy , and if lion like <eos> he tore the fall'n , the eternal was his foe <eos>
soon as glumdalclitch miss 'd her pleasing care <eos> she wept , she blubber 'd , and she tore her hair <eos> no british miss sincerer grief has known <eos> her squirrel missing , or her sparrow flown <eos> she furl 'd her sampler , and haul 'd in her thread <eos> and stuck her needle into grildrig 's bed <eos> then spread her hands , and with a bounce let fall <eos> her baby , like the giant in guildhall <eos> in peals of thunder now she roars , and now <eos> she gently whimpers like a lowing cow <eos> yet lovely in her sorrow still appears <eos> her locks dishevell 'd , and her flood of tears <eos> seem like the lofty barn of some rich swain <eos> when from the thatch drips fast a shower of rain <eos>
when i remember them , those friends of mine <eos> who are no longer here , the noble three <eos> who half my life were more than friends to me <eos> and whose discourse was like a generous wine <eos> i most of all remember the divine <eos> something , that shone in them , and made us see <eos> the archetypal man , and what might be <eos> the amplitude of nature 's first design <eos> in vain i stretch my hands to clasp their hands <eos> i cannot find them . nothing now is left <eos> but a majestic memory . they meanwhile <eos> wander together in elysian lands <eos> perchance remembering me , who am bereft <eos> of their dear presence , and , remembering , smile <eos>
to thee that art the sommers nightingale <eos> thy soveraigne goddesses most deare delight <eos> why doe i send this rustick madrigale <eos> that may thy tunefull eare unseason quite <eos> thou onely fit this argument to write <eos> in whose high thoughts pleasure hath built her bowre <eos> and dainty love learnd sweetly to endite <eos> my rimes i know unsavory and sowre <eos> to taste the streames , that , like a golden showre <eos> flow from thy fruitfull head , of thy loves praise <eos> fitter perhaps to thunder martiall stowre <eos> when so thee list thy loftie muse to raise <eos> yet , till that thou thy poeme wilt make knowne <eos> let thy faire cinthias praises be thus rudely showne <eos>
the rooks aclamor when one enters here <eos> startle the empty towers far overhead <eos> through gaping walls the summer fields appear <eos> green , tan , or , poppy mingled , tinged with red <eos> the courts where revel rang deep grass and moss <eos> cover , and tangled vines have overgrown <eos> the gate where banners blazoned with a cross <eos> rolled forth to toss round tyre and ascalon <eos> decay consumes it . the old causes fade <eos> and fretting for the contest many a heart <eos> waits their tyrtaeus to chant on the new <eos> oh , pass him by who , in this haunted shade <eos> musing enthralled , has only this much art <eos> to love the things the birds and flowers love too <eos>
at times i am the mother of the world <eos> and mine seem all its sorrows , and its fears <eos> that rose , which in each mother heart is curled <eos> the rose of pity , opens with my tears <eos> and , waking in the night , i lie and hark <eos> to the lone sobbing , and the wild alarms <eos> of my world child , a wailing in the dark <eos> the child i fain would shelter in my arms <eos> i call to it ( as from another room <eos> a mother calls , what time she cannot go <eos> ‘ sleep well , dear world ; love hides behind this gloom <eos> there is no need for wakefulness or woe <eos> the long , long night is almost past and gone <eos> the day is near . ’ and yet the world weeps on <eos>
here lie the peril and necessity <eos> that need a race of giants — a great realm <eos> with not one noble leader at the helm <eos> and the great ship of state still driving high <eos> ‘ midst breakers , on a lee shore — to the rocks <eos> with ever and anon most terrible shocks <eos> the crew aghast , and fear in every eye <eos> yet is the gracious providence still nigh <eos> and , if our cause be just , our hearts be true <eos> we shall save goodly ship and gallant crew <eos> nor suffer shipwreck of our liberty <eos> it needs that as a people we arise <eos> with solemn purpose that even fate defies <eos> and brave all perils with unblenching eye <eos>
this pan is but an idle god , i guess <eos> since all the fair midsummer of my dreams <eos> he loiters listlessly by woody streams <eos> soaking the lush glooms up with laziness <eos> or drowsing while the maiden winds caress <eos> him prankishly , and powder him with gleams <eos> of sifted sunshine . and he ever seems <eos> drugged with a joy unutterable — unless <eos> his low pipes whistle hints of it far out <eos> across the ripples to the dragon fly <eos> that like a wind born blossom blown about <eos> drops quiveringly down , as though to die <eos> then lifts and wavers on , as if in doubt <eos> whether to fan his wings or fly without <eos>
