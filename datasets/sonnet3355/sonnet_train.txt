o night and death , to whom we grudged him then <eos> when in man 's sight he stood not yet undone <eos> your king , your priest , your saviour , and your son <eos> we grudge not now , who know that not again <eos> shall this curse come upon the sins of men <eos> nor this face look upon the living sun <eos> that shall behold not so abhorred an one <eos> in all the days whereof his eye takes ken <eos> the bond is cancelled , and the prayer is heard <eos> that seemed so long but weak and wasted breath <eos> take him , for he is yours , o night and death <eos> hell yawns on him whose life was as a word <eos> uttered by death in hate of heaven and light <eos> a curse now dumb upon the lips of night <eos>
she looked at him with almost haughty air <eos> to think that to reprove her he should dare <eos> then fearlessly as some undaunted child <eos> she met his eyes that searched her own for truth <eos> she who had scorned the tempest dark and wild <eos> feared not the chidings of his hasty youth <eos> and undismayed she moved to where he stood <eos> with blushing , beauteous charms of maidenhood <eos> and there with rapt eyes looking up to him <eos> she told him of those visions never dim <eos> of that wild spirit born amid the storm <eos> whose restless strength had swayed her fragile form <eos> before his own she laid her very soul <eos> that he might there its inmost thoughts unroll <eos>
but first , by reason let me prove , i pray <eos> that evil such as this , and which you say <eos> oft weighs you down with soul corroding care <eos> is only in the mind :— mere spright of air <eos> your hat upon your head for instance place <eos> less gently rather than 's your usual case <eos> pray , do n't it presently at ease remain <eos> and from it do you aught amiss retain <eos> not e'en a spot ; there 's nothing half so clear <eos> the features , too , they as before appear <eos> no difference assuredly you see <eos> then how can cuckoldom an evil be <eos> such my conclusion , spite of fools or brutes <eos> with whose ideas reason never suits <eos>
he rose — and slowly , sternly thence withdrew <eos> rage in his eye , and threats in his adieu <eos> ah ! little recked that chief of womanhood <eos> which frowns ne'er quelled , nor menaces subdued <eos> and little deemed he what thy heart , gulnare <eos> when soft could feel — and when incensed could dare <eos> his doubts appeared to wrong — nor yet she knew <eos> how deep the root from whence compassion grew <eos> she was a slave — from such may captives claim <eos> a fellow feeling , differing but in name <eos> still half unconscious — heedless of his wrath <eos> again she ventured on the dangerous path <eos> again his rage repelled — until arose <eos> that strife of thought , the source of woman 's woes <eos>
he spoke , and bade the sad attendants round <eos> cleanse the pale corse , and wash each honour ’ d wound <eos> a massy caldron of stupendous frame <eos> they brought , and placed it o ’ er the rising flame <eos> then heap ’ d the lighted wood ; the flame divides <eos> beneath the vase , and climbs around the sides <eos> in its wide womb they pour the rushing stream <eos> the boiling water bubbles to the brim <eos> the body then they bathe with pious toil <eos> embalm the wounds , anoint the limbs with oil <eos> high on a bed of state extended laid <eos> and decent cover ’ d with a linen shade <eos> last o ’ er the dead the milk white veil they threw <eos> that done , their sorrows and their sighs renew <eos>
he fought in vain ; and on this spot went down <eos> the jus divinum , and the kingly crown <eos> but for those scenes time long has made amends <eos> the ancient enemies are present friends <eos> two swords , in massachusetts , rich in dust <eos> and , better still , the peacefulness of rust <eos> told the whole story in its double parts <eos> to one who lives in two great nations ’ hearts <eos> and late above old england 's roar and din <eos> slow tolling bells spoke sympathy of kin <eos> victoria 's wreath blooms on the sleeping breast <eos> of him just gone to his reward and rest <eos> and firm and fast between two mighty powers <eos> new treaties live in those undying flowers <eos>
i heard in my slumbers the ceaseless roar <eos> of the sparkling waves , as they met the shore <eos> till lulled by the surge of the moon lit deep <eos> by the heaving ocean i sank to sleep <eos> and a magic spell on my spirit was cast <eos> and forms that had perished in ages past <eos> were by fancy revealed to my wondering view <eos> as the veil of oblivion she backward drew <eos> and showed me a glorious vision , dressed <eos> in the rosy light of the glowing west <eos> such colours at parting the day god throws <eos> to gild his path , as rejoicing he goes <eos> like a victor red with the spoils of fight <eos> to raise through darkness the banner of light <eos>

near one of these small openings where the breeze <eos> crept resinous and cool from evergreens <eos> behind them , while the sun blazed bright before <eos> where with the pine trees ’ vapory depth of hue <eos> the whiteness of a spacious tent contrasted <eos> beside which , on a staff , the nation 's flag <eos> flung out its crimson with protecting pride <eos> reclined a wife and husband , looking down <eos> less on the glorious lake than on the glory <eos> that , through a gauzy veil , played round the head <eos> of a reposing infant , golden tressed <eos> asleep upon a deer skin at their feet <eos> while a huge dog kept watchful guard beyond <eos> for there lay little mary merivale <eos>

fire out of heaven , a flower of perfect fire <eos> that where the roots of life are had its root <eos> and where the fruits of time are brought forth fruit <eos> a faith made flesh , a visible desire <eos> that heard the yet unbreathing years respire <eos> and speech break forth of centuries that sit mute <eos> beyond all feebler footprint of pursuit <eos> that touched the highest of hope , and went up higher <eos> a heart love wounded whereto love was law <eos> a soul reproachless without fear or flaw <eos> a shining spirit without shadow of shame <eos> a memory made of all men 's love and awe <eos> being disembodied , so thou be the same <eos> what need , o soul , to sign thee with thy name <eos>
is that a swan that rides upon the water <eos> oh no , it is that other gentle bird <eos> which is the patron of our noble calling <eos> i well remember , in my early years <eos> when these young hands first closed upon a goose <eos> i have a scar upon my thimble finger <eos> which chronicles the hour of young ambition <eos> my father was a tailor , and his father <eos> and my sire 's grandsire , all of them were tailors <eos> they had an ancient goose ,— it was an heirloom <eos> from some remoter tailor of our race <eos> it happened i did see it on a time <eos> when none was near , and i did deal with it <eos> and it did burn me ,— oh , most fearfully <eos>

the good shah akbar ( peace be his alway <eos> came forth from the divan at close of day <eos> bowed with the burden of his many cares <eos> worn with the hearing of unnumbered prayers <eos> wild cries for justice , the importunate <eos> appeals of greed and jealousy and hate <eos> and all the strife of sect and creed and rite <eos> santon and gouroo waging holy fight <eos> for the wise monarch , claiming not to be <eos> allah 's avenger , left his people free <eos> with a faint hope , his book scarce justified <eos> that all the paths of faith , though severed wide <eos> o'er which the feet of prayerful reverence passed <eos> met at the gate of paradise at last <eos>

at midnight when the moonlit cypress trees <eos> have woven round his grave a magic shade <eos> still weeping the unfinished hymn he made <eos> there moves fresh maia like a morning breeze <eos> blown over jonquil beds when warm rains cease <eos> and stooping where her poet 's head is laid <eos> selene weeps while all the tides are stayed <eos> and swaying seas are darkened into peace <eos> but they who wake the meadows and the tides <eos> have hearts too kind to bid him wake from sleep <eos> who murmurs sometimes when his dreams are deep <eos> startling the quiet land where he abides <eos> and charming still , sad eyed persephone <eos> with visions of the sunny earth and sea <eos>
o opulent life of ours , though dispossessed <eos> of treasure after treasure ! youth most fair <eos> went first , but left its priceless coil of hair <eos> moaned over sleepless nights , kissed and caressed <eos> through drip and blur of tears the tenderest <eos> and next went love — the ripe rose glowing there <eos> her very sister !... it is here ; but where <eos> is she , of all the world the first and best <eos> and yet how sweet the sweet earth after rain <eos> how sweet the sunlight on the garden wall <eos> across the roses — and how sweetly flows <eos> the limpid yodel of the brook again <eos> and yet — and yet how sweeter after all <eos> the smouldering sweetness of a dead red rose <eos>
fair eyes , whilst fearful i your fair admire <eos> by unexpress è d sweetness that i gain <eos> my memory of sorrow doth expire <eos> and falcon like , i tower joy 's heavens amain <eos> but when your suns in oceans of their glory <eos> shut up their day bright shine , i die for thought <eos> so pass my joys as doth a new played story <eos> and one poor sigh breathes all delight to naught <eos> so to myself i live not , but for you <eos> for you i live , and you i love , but none else <eos> oh then , fair eyes , whose light i live to view <eos> or poor forlorn despised to live alone else <eos> look sweet , since from the pith of contemplation <eos> love gathereth life , and living , breedeth passion <eos>
pardon , oh , pardon , that my soul should make <eos> of all that strong divineness which i know <eos> for thine and thee , an image only so <eos> formed of the sand , and fit to shift and break <eos> it is that distant years which did not take <eos> thy sovranty , recoiling with a blow <eos> have forced my swimming brain to undergo <eos> their doubt and dread , and blindly to forsake <eos> thy purity of likeness and distort <eos> thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit <eos> as if a shipwrecked pagan , safe in port <eos> his guardian sea god to commemorate <eos> should set a sculptured porpoise , gills a snort <eos> and vibrant tail , within the temple gate <eos>
when first the sun whom all my senses serve <eos> began to shine upon this earthly round <eos> the heavens for her all graces did reserve <eos> that pandor like with all she might abound <eos> apollo placed his brightness in her eyes <eos> his skill presaging and his music sweet <eos> mars gave his force ; all force she now defies <eos> venus her smiles wherewith she mars did meet <eos> python a voice , diana made her chaste <eos> ceres gave plenty , cupid lent his bow <eos> thetis his feet , there pallas wisdom placed <eos> with these she queen like kept a world in awe <eos> yet all these honors deem è d are but pelf <eos> for she is much more worthy of herself <eos>

trained in the holy art whose lifted shield <eos> wards off the darts a never slumbering foe <eos> by hearth and wayside lurking , waits to throw <eos> oppression taught his helpful arm to wield <eos> the slayer 's weapon : on the murderous field <eos> the fiery bolt he challenged laid him low <eos> seeking its noblest victim . even so <eos> the charter of a nation must be sealed <eos> the healer 's brow the hero 's honors crowned <eos> from lowliest duty called to loftiest deed <eos> living , the oak leaf wreath his temples bound <eos> dying , the conqueror 's laurel was his meed <eos> last on the broken ramparts ’ turf to bleed <eos> where freedom 's victory in defeat was found <eos>
here morning in the ploughman 's songs is met <eos> ere yet one footstep shows in all the sky <eos> and twilight in the east , a doubt as yet <eos> shows not her sleeve of grey to know her bye <eos> woke early , i arose and thought that first <eos> in winter time of all the world was i <eos> the old owls might have hallooed if they durst <eos> but joy just then was up and whistled bye <eos> a merry tune which i had known full long <eos> but could not to my memory wake it back <eos> until the ploughman changed it to the song <eos> o happiness , how simple is thy track <eos> — tinged like the willow shoots , the east 's young brow <eos> glows red and finds thee singing at the plough <eos>

charles ! my slow heart was only sad , when first <eos> i scanned that face of feeble infancy <eos> for dimly on my thoughtful spirit burst <eos> all i had been , and all my child might be <eos> but when i saw it on its mother 's arm <eos> and hanging at her bosom ( she the while <eos> bent o'er its features with a tearful smile <eos> then i was thrilled and melted , and most warm <eos> impressed a father 's kiss : and all beguiled <eos> of dark remembrance and presageful fear <eos> i seemed to see an angel form appear <eos> ‘ twas even thine , beloved woman mild <eos> so for the mother 's sake the child was dear <eos> and dearer was the mother for the child <eos>
still earnest with my theme , i bade him think <eos> of auerbach 's cellar , and that wassail night <eos> whole centuries ago : and then in phrase <eos> better than that which cometh to me now <eos> i likened it — the necromancy which <eos> drew richest vintage from the rugged boards <eos> unto the spell wherewith he 'd bound himself <eos> the spell by which he drew from simplest things <eos> conceptions beautiful , as faust drew wine <eos> from the rude table ; for this friend of mine <eos> was a true poet , though he seldom wrote <eos> the wealth which might have royally endowed <eos> some noble charity for coming time <eos> was idly wasted — pearls dissolved in wine <eos>

a ladder , which my ken pursued in vain <eos> so lofty was the summit ; down whose steps <eos> i saw the splendours in such multitude <eos> descending , ev'ry light in heav'n , methought <eos> was shed thence . as the rooks , at dawn of day <eos> bestirring them to dry their feathers chill <eos> some speed their way a field , and homeward some <eos> returning , cross their flight , while some abide <eos> and wheel around their airy lodge ; so seem 'd <eos> that glitterance , wafted on alternate wing <eos> as upon certain stair it met , and clash 'd <eos> its shining . and one ling'ring near us , wax 'd <eos> so bright , that in my thought : said : “ the love <eos> which this betokens me , admits no doubt <eos>
when i have borne in memory what has tamed <eos> great nations , how ennobling thoughts depart <eos> when men change swords for ledgers , and desert <eos> the student 's bower for gold , some fears unnamed <eos> i had , my country !— am i to be blamed <eos> but when i think of thee , and what thou art <eos> verily , in the bottom of my heart <eos> of those unfilial fears i am ashamed <eos> but dearly must we prize thee ; we who find <eos> in thee a bulwark for the cause of men <eos> and i by my affection was beguiled <eos> what wonder if a poet now and then <eos> among the many movements of his mind <eos> felt for thee as a lover or a child <eos>
a cloud lay cradled near the setting sun <eos> a gleam of crimson tinged its braided snow <eos> long had i watched the glory moving on <eos> o'er the still radiance of the lake below <eos> tranquil its spirit seemed , and floated slow <eos> even in its very motion there was rest <eos> while every breath of eve that chanced to blow <eos> wafted the traveller to the beauteous west <eos> emblem , methought , of the departed soul <eos> to whose white robe the gleam of bliss is given <eos> and by the breath of mercy made to roll <eos> right onwards to the golden gates of heaven <eos> where to the eye of faith it peaceful lies <eos> and tells to man his glorious destinies <eos>
here paused the witch to mend her glowing fire <eos> while each man to his neighbour shuffled nigher <eos> as witch flame leapt and ever brighter grew <eos> till , to their horror , sudden it burned blue <eos> whereat each silent , fearful beholder <eos> felt in the gloom to touch his fellow 's shoulder <eos> yet , in that moment , knew an added dread <eos> to see the fire from blue turn ghastly red <eos> then , as the witch did o'er it crooning lean <eos> behold ! it changed again to baleful green <eos> whereat the witch flung bony arms on high <eos> as though with claw like hands she ‘ d rend the sky <eos> and while the lurid flames leapt ever higher <eos> she thus invoked the spirit of the fire <eos>
dear , though from me your gratious looks depart <eos> and of that comfort do myself bereave <eos> which both i did deserve and did receive <eos> triumph not over much in this my smart <eos> nay , rather they which now enjoy thy heart <eos> for fear just cause of mourning should conceive <eos> lest thou inconstant shouldst their trust deceive <eos> which like unto the weather changing art <eos> for in foul weather birds sing often will <eos> in hope of fair , and in fair time will cease <eos> for fear fair time should not continue still <eos> so they may mourn which have thy heart possessed <eos> for fear of change , and hope of change may ease <eos> their hearts whom grief of change doth now molest <eos>
but dagonet with one foot poised in his hand <eos> ‘ friend , did ye mark that fountain yesterday <eos> made to run wine ?— but this had run itself <eos> all out like a long life to a sour end <eos> and them that round it sat with golden cups <eos> to hand the wine to whosoever came <eos> the twelve small damosels white as innocence <eos> in honour of poor innocence the babe <eos> who left the gems which innocence the queen <eos> lent to the king , and innocence the king <eos> gave for a prize — and one of those white slips <eos> handed her cup and piped , the pretty one <eos> “ drink , drink , sir fool , ” and thereupon i drank <eos> spat — pish — the cup was gold , the draught was mud <eos>
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes <eos> and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he <eos> remembered in what a haughtier guise <eos> he had flung an alms to leprosie <eos> when he girt his young life up in gilded mail <eos> and set forth in search of the holy grail <eos> the heart within him was ashes and dust <eos> he parted in twain his single crust <eos> he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink <eos> and gave the leper to eat and drink <eos> ‘ twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread <eos> ‘ twas water out of a wooden bowl <eos> yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed <eos> and ‘ twas red wine he drank with his thirsty soul <eos>

are you still doubtful of me — hesitant still <eos> fearful , perhaps , that i may yet remember <eos> what you would gladly , if you could , forget <eos> you were unfaithful once , you met your lover <eos> still in your heart you bear that red eyed ember <eos> and i was silent ,— you remember my silence yet <eos> you knew , as well as i , i could not kill him <eos> nor touch him with hot hands , nor yet with hate <eos> no , and it was not you i saw with anger <eos> instead , i rose and beat at steel walled fate <eos> cried till i lay exhausted , sick , unfriended <eos> that life , so seeming sure , and love , so certain <eos> should loose such tricks , be so abruptly ended <eos> ring down so suddenly an unlooked for curtain <eos>
between the two white breasts of her we love <eos> a dewy blushing rose will sometimes spring <eos> thus nonnenwerth like an enchanted thing <eos> rises mid stream the crystal depths above <eos> on either side the waters heave and swell <eos> but all is calm within the little isle <eos> content it is to give its holy smile <eos> and bless with peace the lives that in it dwell <eos> most dear on the dark grass beneath its bower <eos> of kindred trees embracing branch and bough <eos> to dream of fairy foot and sudden flower <eos> or haply with a twilight on the brow <eos> to muse upon the legendary hour <eos> and roland 's lonely love and hildegard 's sad vow <eos>
i am no model figure , or sign of care <eos> but his eternal heart'shyppphenconsuming essence <eos> in whom grief 's commentaries written are <eos> drawing gross passion into pure quintessence <eos> not thine eye 's fire , but fire of thine eye 's disdain <eos> fed by neglect of my continual grieving <eos> attracts the true life 's spirit of my pain <eos> and gives it thee , which gives me no relieving <eos> within thine arms sad elegies i sing <eos> unto thine eyes a true heart love torn lay i <eos> thou smell'st from me the savours sorrows bring <eos> my tears to taste my truth to touch display i <eos> lo thus each sense , dear fair one , i importune <eos> but being care , thou flyest me as ill fortune <eos>
and little dagonet mincing with his feet <eos> “ knight , an ye fling those rubies round my neck <eos> in lieu of hers , i 'll hold thou hast some touch <eos> of music , since i care not for thy pearls <eos> swine ? i have wallow 'd , i have wash 'd — the world <eos> is flesh and shadow — i have had my day <eos> the dirty nurse , experience , in her kind <eos> hath foul 'd me — an i wallow 'd , then i wash 'd <eos> i have had my day and my philosophies <eos> and thank the lord i am king arthur 's fool <eos> swine , say ye ? swine , goats , asses , rams and geese <eos> troop 'd round a paynim harper once , who thrumm 'd <eos> on such a wire as musically as thou <eos> some such fine song — but never a king 's fool <eos>
there is a race which cold , ungenial skies <eos> breed from decay , as fungous growths arise <eos> though dying fast , yet springing fast again <eos> which still usurps an unsubstantial reign <eos> with frames too languid for the charms of sense <eos> and minds worn down with action too intense <eos> tired of a world whose joys they never knew <eos> themselves deceived , yet thinking all untrue <eos> scarce men without , and less than girls within <eos> sick of their life before its cares begin <eos> the dull disease , which drains their feeble hearts <eos> to life 's decay some hectic thrill 's imparts <eos> and lends a force which , like the maniac 's power <eos> pays with blank years the frenzy of an hour <eos>
she did n't faint ; she knelt by my side <eos> an ’ thanked the lord , till i fairly cried <eos> an ’ maybe our ride was n't pleasant an ’ gay <eos> an ’ maybe she was n't wrapped up that day <eos> an ’ maybe our cottage was n't warm an ’ bright <eos> an ’ maybe it was n't a pleasant sight <eos> to see her a gettin ’ the evenin 's tea <eos> an ’ frequently stoppin ’ and kissin ’ me <eos> an ’ maybe we did n't live happy for years <eos> in spite of my brothers ’ and sisters ’ sneers <eos> who often said , as i have heard <eos> that they would n't own a prison bird <eos> ( though they 're gettin ’ over that , i guess <eos> for all of ‘ em owe me more or less <eos>
no sooner ceased the sound , than i beheld <eos> four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps <eos> of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad <eos> when thus my master kind began : “ mark him <eos> who in his right hand bears that falchion keen <eos> the other three preceding , as their lord <eos> this is that homer , of all bards supreme <eos> flaccus the next , in satire 's vein excelling <eos> the third is naso ; lucan is the last <eos> because they all that appellation own <eos> with which the voice singly accosted me <eos> honouring they greet me thus , and well they judge <eos> so i beheld united the bright school <eos> of him the monarch of sublimest song <eos>
i loved you first : but afterwards your love <eos> outsoaring mine , sang such a loftier song <eos> as drowned the friendly cooings of my dove <eos> which owes the other most ? my love was long <eos> and yours one moment seemed to wax more strong <eos> i loved and guessed at you , you construed me <eos> and loved me for what might or might not be <eos> nay , weights and measures do us both a wrong <eos> for verily love knows not “ mine ” or “ thine <eos> with separate “ i ” and “ thou ” free love has done <eos> for one is both and both are one in love <eos> rich love knows nought of “ thine that is not mine <eos> both have the strength and both the length thereof <eos> both of us of the love which makes us one <eos>
who stood upon that schooner 's driven deck <eos> last night as reefed and shuddering she hove <eos> into the twilight and all desperate drove <eos> from wave to angrier wave that sought her wreck <eos> who labored at her helm and watched the wind <eos> stagger the sea with all his stunning might <eos> until in dimness dwindling from our sight <eos> she vanished in the wrack that rode behind <eos> we know not , you and i , but our two souls <eos> that followed as storm petrels o'er the waves <eos> felt all the might of him who sinks or saves <eos> and all the pity of earth 's unreached goals <eos> felt all — then swift returning to our love <eos> dwelt in its peace , uplifted safe above <eos>
fair was the maid , and lovely as the morn <eos> from starry night and rosy twilight born <eos> within whose mind a rivulet of song <eos> rehearsed the strains that from her lips ere long <eos> welled free and sparkling , as the vocal woods <eos> repeat the day spring 's sweetest interludes <eos> her gentle eyes ’ serenest depths of blue <eos> shrined love and truth , and all their retinue <eos> the health and beauty of her youthful face <eos> made it the harem of each maiden grace <eos> and such perfection blended with her air <eos> she seemed some stately goddess moving there <eos> beholding her , you thought she might have been <eos> the long lost , flower loving proserpine <eos>
there , while the muses wanton unconfined <eos> and wreaths resplendent round their temples bind <eos> ‘ tis yours to strew their steps with votive flowers <eos> to watch them slumbering ‘ midst the blissful bowers <eos> to guard the shades that hide their sacred charms <eos> and shield their beauties from unhallow 'd arms <eos> oh ! may their suppliant steal a passing kiss <eos> alas ! he pants not for superior bliss <eos> thrice bless 'd his virgin modesty shall be <eos> to snatch an evanescent ecstacy <eos> the fierce extremes of superhuman love <eos> for his frail sense too exquisite might prove <eos> he turns , all blushing , from th ’ a ö nian shade <eos> to humbler raptures with a mortal maid <eos>
when i consider how my light is spent <eos> ere half my days , in this dark world and wide <eos> and that one talent which is death to hide <eos> lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent <eos> to serve therewith my maker , and present <eos> my true account , lest he , returning , chide <eos> “ doth god exact day labor , light denied <eos> i fondly ask . but patience , to prevent <eos> that murmur , soon replies , “ god doth not need <eos> either man 's work or his own gifts . who best <eos> bear his mild yoke , they serve him best . his state <eos> is kingly : thousands at his bidding speed <eos> and post o'er land and ocean without rest <eos> they also serve who only stand and wait <eos>
the cat runs races with her tail . the dog <eos> leaps oer the orchard hedge and knarls the grass <eos> the swine run round and grunt and play with straw <eos> snatching out hasty mouthfuls from the stack <eos> sudden upon the elmtree tops the crow <eos> unceremonious visit pays and croaks <eos> then swops away . from mossy barn the owl <eos> bobs hasty out — wheels round and , scared as soon <eos> as hastily retires . the ducks grow wild <eos> and from the muddy pond fly up and wheel <eos> a circle round the village and soon , tired <eos> plunge in the pond again . the maids in haste <eos> snatch from the orchard hedge the mizzled clothes <eos> and laughing hurry in to keep them dry <eos>
sweet love renew thy force , be it not said <eos> thy edge should blunter be than appetite <eos> which but to day by feeding is allayed <eos> to morrow sharpened in his former might <eos> so love be thou , although to day thou fill <eos> thy hungry eyes , even till they wink with fulness <eos> to morrow see again , and do not kill <eos> the spirit of love , with a perpetual dulness <eos> let this sad interim like the ocean be <eos> which parts the shore , where two contracted new <eos> come daily to the banks , that when they see <eos> return of love , more blest may be the view <eos> or call it winter , which being full of care <eos> makes summer 's welcome , thrice more wished , more rare <eos>
forth from his barren cell came kathanal <eos> strong and inspired , born anew for deeds <eos> straightway he grew to be the bravest knight <eos> under king constantine , since sir sanpeur <eos> the boldest in the battles for the right <eos> the kindest in his judgment of the wrong <eos> his eyes that held the vision of the grail <eos> were ever clear to see and know the truth <eos> his lips that had been touched by holy chrism <eos> were strong to utter holy living words <eos> he sang of life in life , and life in death <eos> and taught the lesson that his heart had learned <eos> all love should be a glory , not a doom <eos> love for love 's sake , albeit bliss denied <eos>
“ but when the gods , frustrated , this beheld <eos> how , living still , among the dead she dwelled <eos> because she lived in him whose life she won <eos> and her blood beat in his beneath the sun <eos> they reasoned : ‘ when the bitter stygian wave <eos> the sweetness of love 's kisses cannot lave <eos> when the pale flood of lethe washes not <eos> from mortal mind one high immortal thought <eos> akin to us the earthly creature grows <eos> since nature suffers only what it knows <eos> if she whom we to this grey desert banned <eos> still dreams she treads with him the sunlit land <eos> that for his sake she left without a tear <eos> set wide the gates — her being is not here <eos>
to yon dim rounds first elevate thy view <eos> see quito 's plains o'erlook their proud peru <eos> on whose huge base , like isles amid sky driven <eos> a vast protuberance props the cope of heaven <eos> earth 's loftiest turrets there contend for height <eos> and all our andes fill the bounded sight <eos> from south to north what long blue swells arise <eos> built thro the clouds , and lost in ambient skies <eos> approaching slow they heave expanding bounds <eos> the yielding concave bends sublimer rounds <eos> whose wearied stars , high curving to the west <eos> pause on the summits for a moment 's rest <eos> recumbent there they renovate their force <eos> and roll rejoicing on their downward course <eos>
no , not in vain he died — not all in vain <eos> our good , great president ! this people 's hands <eos> are linked together in one mighty chain <eos> drawn tighter still in triple woven bands <eos> to crush the fiends in human masks , whose might <eos> we suffer , oh , too long ! no league , nor truce <eos> save men with men ! the devils we must fight <eos> with fire ! god wills it in this deed . this use <eos> we draw from the most impious murder done <eos> since calvary . rise then , o countrymen <eos> scatter these marsh lights hopes of union won <eos> through pardoning clemency . strike , strike again <eos> draw closer round the foe a girdling flame <eos> we are stabbed whene'er we spare — strike in god 's name <eos>
my love , and not i , is the egoist <eos> my love for thee loves itself more than thee <eos> ay , more than me , in whom it doth exist <eos> and makes me live that it may feed on me <eos> in the country of bridges the bridge is <eos> more real than the shores it doth unsever <eos> so in our world , all of relation , this <eos> is true — that truer is love than either lover <eos> this thought therefore comes lightly to doubt ’ s door <eos> if we , seeing substance of this world , are not <eos> mere intervals , god ’ s absence and no more <eos> hollows in real consciousness and thought <eos> and if ’ tis possible to thought to bear this fruit <eos> why should it not be possible to truth <eos>
give me the treble of thy horns and hoofs <eos> the ponderous undertones of ‘ bus and tram <eos> a garret and a glimpse across the roofs <eos> of clouds blown eastward over notre dame <eos> the glad eyed streets and radiant gatherings <eos> where i drank deep the bliss of being young <eos> the strife and sweet potential flux of things <eos> i sought youth 's dream of happiness among <eos> it walks here aureoled with the city light <eos> forever through the myriad featured mass <eos> flaunting not far its fugitive embrace <eos> heard sometimes in a song across the night <eos> caught in a perfume from the crowds that pass <eos> and when love yields to love seen face to face <eos>
laughing , “ to night , ” i said to him , “ the park <eos> has turned the garden of a symbolist <eos> those old great trees that rise above the mist <eos> gold with the light of evening , and the dark <eos> still water , where the dying sun evokes <eos> an echoed glory — here i recognize <eos> those ancient gardens mirrored by the eyes <eos> of poets that hate the world of common folks <eos> like you and me and that thin pious crowd <eos> which yonder sings its hymns , so humbly proud <eos> of holiness . the garden of escape <eos> lies here ; a small green world , and still the bride <eos> of quietness , although an imminent rape <eos> roars ceaselessly about on every side <eos>
here the whole land doth scorching lye <eos> under the glittering armes o ’ th ’ enemy <eos> under the hovering stroke o ’ th ’ fates <eos> the armies yet both stand ; and fury waites <eos> with doubfull steps , upon the warre <eos> fresh courage here , the mingled troopes prepare <eos> each against other fiercely run <eos> and mutually they worke destruction <eos> the slaughtered heapes in reeking gore <eos> with bloudy covering spread the fields all o ’ re <eos> here on safe seas , as joyfull prize <eos> is strip ’ d away th ’æ gyptian merchandize <eos> whilst the full havens thick beset <eos> doe furiously with fierce contention fret <eos>
they that in course of heavenly spheares are skild <eos> to every planet point his sundry yeare <eos> in which her circles voyage is fulfild <eos> as mars in threescore yeares doth run his spheare <eos> so , since the winged god his planet cleare <eos> began in me to move , one yeare is spent <eos> the which doth longer unto me appeare <eos> then al those fourty which my life out went <eos> then , by that count which lovers books invent <eos> the spheare of cupid fourty yeares containes <eos> which i have wasted in long languishment <eos> that seem 'd the longer for my greater paines <eos> but let my loves fayre planet short her wayes <eos> this yeare ensuing , or else short my dayes <eos>
what viewed i , dear , when i thine eyes beheld <eos> love in his glory ? no , him thyrsis saw <eos> and stood the boy , whilst he his darts did draw <eos> whose painted pride to baser swains he telled <eos> saw i two suns ? that sight is seen but seld <eos> yet can their brood that teach the holy law <eos> gaze on their beams , and dread them not a straw <eos> where princely looks are by their eyes repelled <eos> what saw i then ? doubtless it was amen <eos> armed with strong thunder and a lightning 's flame <eos> who bridegroom like with power was riding then <eos> meaning that none should see him when he came <eos> yet did i gaze ; and thereby caught the wound <eos> which burns my heart and keeps my body sound <eos>
one spring brought me my wedding day <eos> brought me my bright eyed jeanne amray <eos> brought that night to our cabin door <eos> my old , lost comrade , nell latore <eos> her eyes swam fire , and her cheek was red <eos> her full breast heaved as she darkly said <eos> “ the coyote hides from the wind and rain <eos> the wild horse flies from the hurricane <eos> but who can flee from the half breed 's hate <eos> that rises soon and that watches late <eos> then went ; and i laughed jeanne 's fears afar <eos> but i thought that wench was our evil star <eos> be sure , when a woman 's heart gets hard <eos> it works up war like a navy yard <eos>
i care not that one listen if he lives <eos> for aught but life 's romance , nor puts above <eos> all life 's necessities the need to love <eos> nor counts his greatest wealth what beauty gives <eos> but sometime on an afternoon in spring <eos> when dandelions dot the fields with gold <eos> and under rustling shade a few weeks old <eos> ‘ tis sweet to stroll and hear the bluebirds sing <eos> do you , blond head , whom beauty and the power <eos> of being young and winsome have prepared <eos> for life 's last privilege that really pays <eos> make the companion of an idle hour <eos> these relics of the time when i too fared <eos> across the sweet fifth lustrum of my days <eos>

safer with winds and waves than human wrath <eos> with ravening wolves than those whose zeal for god <eos> was cruelty to man , the exiles trod <eos> drear leagues of forest without guide or path <eos> or launching frail boats on the uncharted sea <eos> round storm vexed capes , whose teeth of granite ground <eos> the waves to foam , their perilous way they wound <eos> enduring all things so their souls were free <eos> oh , true confessors , shaming them who did <eos> anew the wrong their pilgrim fathers bore <eos> for you the mayflower spread her sail once more <eos> freighted with souls , to all that duty bid <eos> faithful as they who sought an unknown land <eos> o'er wintry seas , from holland 's hook of sand <eos>
so now i have confessed that he is thine <eos> and i my self am mortgaged to thy will <eos> my self i 'll forfeit , so that other mine <eos> thou wilt restore to be my comfort still <eos> but thou wilt not , nor he will not be free <eos> for thou art covetous , and he is kind <eos> he learned but surety like to write for me <eos> under that bond that him as fist doth bind <eos> the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take <eos> thou usurer that put'st forth all to use <eos> and sue a friend , came debtor for my sake <eos> so him i lose through my unkind abuse <eos> him have i lost , thou hast both him and me <eos> he pays the whole , and yet am i not free <eos>
upon a rock i sat — a mountain side <eos> far , far forsaken of the old sea 's lip <eos> a rock where ancient waters ’ rise and dip <eos> recoil and plunge , eddy , and oscillant tide <eos> had worn and worn , while races lived and died <eos> involved channels . where the sea weed 's drip <eos> followed the ebb , now crumbling lichens sip <eos> sparse dews of heaven that down with sunset slide <eos> i sat long gazing southward . a dry flow <eos> of withering wind sucked up my drooping strength <eos> itself weak from the desert 's burning length <eos> behind me piled , away and up did go <eos> great sweeps of savage mountains — up , away <eos> where snow gleams ever , panthers roam , they say <eos>
oh pleasing thoughts , apprentices of love <eos> fore runners of desire , sweet mithridates <eos> the poison of my sorrows to remove <eos> with whom my hopes and fear full oft debates <eos> enrich yourselves and me by your self riches <eos> which are the thoughts you spend on heaven bred beauty <eos> rouse you my muse beyond our poets ’ pitches <eos> and , working wonders , yet say all is duty <eos> use you no eaglets ’ eyes , nor phoenix ’ feathers <eos> to tower the heaven from whence heaven 's wonder sallies <eos> for why ? your sun sings sweetly to her weathers <eos> making a spring of winter in the valleys <eos> show to the world though poor and scant my skill is <eos> how sweet thoughts be , that are but thought on phillis <eos>
dear unborn children , to our mother 's trust <eos> we leave you , fearless , when we lie in dust <eos> while o'er these walls the christian banner waves <eos> from hallowed lips shall flow the truth that saves <eos> while o'er those portals veritas you read <eos> no church shall bind you with its human creed <eos> take from the past the best its toil has won <eos> but learn betimes its slavish ruts to shun <eos> pass the old tree whose withered leaves are shed <eos> quit the old paths that error loved to tread <eos> and a new wreath of living blossoms seek <eos> a narrower pathway up a loftier peak <eos> lose not your reverence , but unmanly fear <eos> leave far behind you , all who enter here <eos>
when forty winters shall besiege thy brow <eos> and dig deep trenches in thy beauty 's field <eos> thy youth 's proud livery so gazed on now <eos> will be a tattered weed of small worth held <eos> then being asked , where all thy beauty lies <eos> where all the treasure of thy lusty days <eos> to say within thine own deep sunken eyes <eos> were an all eating shame , and thriftless praise <eos> how much more praise deserved thy beauty 's use <eos> if thou couldst answer ‘ this fair child of mine <eos> shall sum my count , and make my old excuse <eos> proving his beauty by succession thine <eos> this were to be new made when thou art old <eos> and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold <eos>
life ever seems as from its present site <eos> it aimed to lure us . mountains of the past <eos> it melts , with all their crags and caverns vast <eos> into a purple cloud ! across the night <eos> which hides what is to be , it shoots a light <eos> all rosy with the yet unrisen dawn <eos> not the near daisies , but yon distant height <eos> attracts us , lying on this emerald lawn <eos> and always , be the landscape what it may <eos> blue , misty hill or sweep of glimmering plain <eos> it is the eye 's endeavor still to gain <eos> the fine , faint limit of the bounding day <eos> god , haply , in this mystic mode , would fain <eos> hint of a happier home , far , far away <eos>
th ’ escorting spirits turn 'd with gentle looks <eos> toward me , and the mantuan spake : “ my son <eos> here torment thou mayst feel , but canst not death <eos> remember thee , remember thee , if i <eos> safe e'en on geryon brought thee : now i come <eos> more near to god , wilt thou not trust me now <eos> of this be sure : though in its womb that flame <eos> a thousand years contain 'd thee , from thy head <eos> no hair should perish . if thou doubt my truth <eos> approach , and with thy hands thy vesture 's hem <eos> stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief <eos> lay now all fear , o lay all fear aside <eos> turn hither , and come onward undismay 'd <eos> i still , though conscience urg 'd ’ no step advanc 'd <eos>
beneath thy midas touch life 's sullen grays <eos> are thrilled to sudden gold ; as some far gleam <eos> from wings of helios athwart thy dream <eos> irradiates for thee earth 's darksome ways <eos> wild woodland voices ripple thro ’ thy lays <eos> sweet silvern murmurs from some deep delled spring <eos> brook , tree and flower and each insensate thing <eos> the throstle 's call , the calm of sun steeped days <eos> a glint of sunshine on the swallow 's wing <eos> fern filagrees , the drowsy drone of bee <eos> made drunk with draughts of purple wild grape wine <eos> all these orph è an music holds for thee <eos> and all thy days and dreams companioning <eos> walks nature with her hand close clasped in thine <eos>
upon an hill a bright flame i did see <eos> waving aloft with triple point to skie <eos> which , like incense of precious cedar tree <eos> with balmie odours fil 'd th'ayre farre and nie <eos> a bird all white , well feathered on each wing <eos> hereout up to the throne of gods did flie <eos> and all the way most pleasant notes did sing <eos> whilst in the smoake she unto heaven did stie <eos> of this faire fire the scattered rayes forth threw <eos> on everie side a thousand shining beames <eos> when sudden dropping of a silver dew <eos> ( o grievous chance !) gan quench those precious flames <eos> that it , which earst ** so pleasant sent did yeld <eos> of nothing now but noyous sulphure smeld <eos>
there drew he forth the brand excalibur <eos> and o'er him , drawing it , the winter moon <eos> brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran forth <eos> and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt <eos> for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks <eos> myriads of topaz lights , and jacinth work <eos> of subtlest jewellery . he gazed so long <eos> that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood <eos> this way and that dividing the swift mind <eos> in act to throw : but at the last it seem 'd <eos> better to leave excalibur conceal 'd <eos> there in the many knotted water flags <eos> that whistled stiff and dry about the marge <eos> so strode he back slow to the wounded king <eos>
the flower that 's gathered beauty soon forsakes <eos> the bliss grows feeble as we gain the prize <eos> love dreams of joy , and in possession wakes <eos> scarce time enough to hail it ere it dies <eos> life intermingles , with its cares and sighs <eos> and rapture 's dreams are ended . heavenly flower <eos> it is not so with thee ! still fancy 's power <eos> throws rainbow halos round thee , and thine eyes <eos> that once did steal their sapphire blue from even <eos> are beaming on ; thy cheeks ’ bewitching dye <eos> where partial roses all their blooms had given <eos> still in fond memory with the rose can vie <eos> and thy sweet bosom , which to view was heaven <eos> no lily yet a fairer hue supplies <eos>
now friends conversing my soft hours refine <eos> and tully 's tusculum revives in mine <eos> now to grave books i bid the mind retreat <eos> and such as make me rather good than great <eos> or o'er the works of easy fancy rove <eos> where flutes and innocence amuse the grove <eos> the native bard that on sicilian plains <eos> first sung the lowly manners of the swains <eos> or maro 's muse , that in the fairest light <eos> paints rural prospects and the charms of sight <eos> these soft amusements bring content along <eos> and fancy , void of sorrow , turns to song <eos> here beauteous health for all the year remain <eos> when the next comes , i 'll charm thee thus again <eos>
ah ! changed and cold , how changed and very cold <eos> with stiffened smiling lips and cold calm eyes <eos> changed , yet the same ; much knowing , little wise <eos> this was the promise of the days of old <eos> grown hard and stubborn in the ancient mould <eos> grown rigid in the sham of lifelong lies <eos> we hoped for better things as years would rise <eos> but it is over as a tale once told <eos> all fallen the blossom that no fruitage bore <eos> all lost the present and the future time <eos> all lost , all lost , the lapse that went before <eos> so lost till death shut to the opened door <eos> so lost from chime to everlasting chime <eos> so cold and lost for ever evermore <eos>
when satisfied the smart gallant appeared <eos> and anxiously to putting off adhered <eos> pretending that the wind and tide would fail <eos> the galleys sometimes were unfit to sail <eos> repairs required ; then further heard the news <eos> that certain pirates had unpleasant views <eos> to fall upon the escort they 'd contrived <eos> at length , a pirate suddenly arrived <eos> surprized the party left upon the shore <eos> destroyed the whole ; then sought the house for more <eos> and scaled the walls while darkness spread around <eos> the pirate was grifonio 's second found <eos> who , in a trice , the noble mansion took <eos> and joy gave place to grief in ev'ry look <eos>
he turns about to face the loud uproar <eos> and drives the rebels to their very door <eos> the frequent stone is hurled where eer they go <eos> when badgers fight , then every one 's a foe <eos> the dogs are clapt and urged to join the fray <eos> the badger turns and drives them all away <eos> though scarcely half as big , demure and small <eos> he fights with dogs for bones and beats them all <eos> the heavy mastiff , savage in the fray <eos> lies down and licks his feet and turns away <eos> the bulldog knows his match and waxes cold <eos> the badger grins and never leaves his hold <eos> he drives the crowd and follows at their heels <eos> and bites them through — the drunkard swears and reels <eos>
last night her form the hours of slumber bless 'd <eos> whose eyes illumin 'd all my youthful years <eos> spirit of dreams , at thy command appears <eos> each airy shape , that visiting our rest <eos> dismays , perplexes , or delights the breast <eos> my pensive heart this kind indulgence cheers <eos> bliss , in no waking moment now possess 'd <eos> bliss , ask 'd of thee with memory 's thrilling tears <eos> nightly i cry , how oft , alas ! in vain <eos> give , by thy powers , that airy shapes controul <eos> honora to my visions !— ah ! ordain <eos> her beauteous lip may wear the smile that stole <eos> in years long fled , the sting from every pain <eos> show her sweet face , ah show it to my soul <eos>
too , too prophetic did thy wild note swell <eos> impassion 'd minstrel ! when its pitying wail <eos> sigh 'd o'er the vernal primrose as it fell <eos> untimely , wither 'd by the northern gale <eos> thou wert that flower of promise and of prime <eos> whose opening bloom , ‘ mid many an adverse blast <eos> charm 'd the lone wanderer through this desert clime <eos> but charm 'd him with a rapture soon o'ercast <eos> to see thee languish into quick decay <eos> yet was not thy departing immature <eos> for ripe in virtue thou wert reft away <eos> and pure in spirit , as the bless 'd are pure <eos> pure as the dewdrop , freed from earthly leaven <eos> that sparkles , is exhaled , and blends with heaven <eos>
“ there were but two , and we were forty ! yet <eos> the captain wrote , “ that dauntless couple throve <eos> and faced our wildering faces ; and i said <eos> ‘ lie to awhile ! ’ i did not choose to let <eos> a strife go on of little worth to us <eos> and so unequal ! but the dying tread <eos> of flying kinsmen moved them not : for wet <eos> with surf and wild with streaks of white and black <eos> the pair remained . ” — o stout caractacus <eos> ‘ twas thus you stood when caesar 's legions strove <eos> to beat their few , fantastic foemen back <eos> your patriots with their savage stripes of red <eos> to drench the stormy cliff and moaning cove <eos> with faithful blood , as pure as any ever shed <eos>
we , like the leaf , the summit , or the wave <eos> reflect the light our common nature gave <eos> but every sunbeam , falling from her throne <eos> wears on our hearts some coloring of our own <eos> chilled in the slave , and burning in the free <eos> like the sealed cavern by the sparkling sea <eos> lost , like the lightning in the sullen clod <eos> or shedding radiance , like the smiles of god <eos> pure , pale in virtue , as the star above <eos> or quivering roseate on the leaves of love <eos> glaring like noontide , where it glows upon <eos> ambition 's sands ,— the desert in the sun <eos> or soft suffusing o'er the varied scene <eos> life 's common coloring ,— intellectual green <eos>
sweet soul , which , in the april of thy years <eos> for to enrich the heaven mad'st poor this round <eos> and now , with flaming rays of glory crown 'd <eos> most blest abides above the sphere of spheres <eos> if heavenly laws , alas ! have not thee bound <eos> from looking to this globe that all upbears <eos> if ruth and pity there above be found <eos> oh , deign to lend a look unto these tears <eos> do not disdain , dear ghost , this sacrifice <eos> and though i raise not pillars to thy praise <eos> my offerings take , let this for me suffice <eos> my heart a living pyramid i raise <eos> and whilst kings ’ tombs with laurels flourish green <eos> thine shall with myrtles and these flowers be seen <eos>
all are but parts of one stupendous whole <eos> whose body nature is , and god the soul <eos> that , changed through all , and yet in all the same <eos> great in the earth as in th ’ ethereal frame <eos> warms in the sun , refreshes in the breeze <eos> glows in the stars and blossoms in the trees <eos> lives through all life , extends through all extent <eos> spreads undivided , operates unspent <eos> breathes in our souls , informs our mortal part <eos> as full , as perfect , in a hair as heart <eos> as full , as perfect , in vile man that mourns <eos> as the rapt seraph that adores and burns <eos> to him no high , no low , no great , no small <eos> he fills , he bounds , connects , and equals all <eos>
what does the dim gaze of the dying find <eos> to waken dream or memory , seeing you <eos> in your sweet eyes what other eyes are blue <eos> and in your hair what gold hair on the wind <eos> floats of the days gone almost out of mind <eos> in deep green valleys of the fatherland <eos> he may remember girls with locks like thine <eos> may dream how , where the waiting angels stand <eos> some lost love 's eyes are dim before they shine <eos> with welcome : — so past homes , or homes to be <eos> he sees a moment , ere , a moment blind <eos> he crosses death 's inhospitable sea <eos> and with brief passage of those barren lands <eos> comes to the home that is not made with hands <eos>
you think this cruel ? take it for a rule <eos> no creature smarts so little as a fool <eos> let peals of laughter , codrus ! round thee break <eos> thou unconcern 'd canst hear the mighty crack <eos> pit , box , and gall'ry in convulsions hurl 'd <eos> thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world <eos> who shames a scribbler ? break one cobweb thro <eos> he spins the slight , self pleasing thread anew <eos> destroy his fib or sophistry , in vain <eos> the creature 's at his dirty work again <eos> thron 'd in the centre of his thin designs <eos> proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines <eos> whom have i hurt ? has poet yet , or peer <eos> lost the arch 'd eye brow , or parnassian sneer <eos>
straightway did andrew answer him again <eos> “ almighty god with ease can rescue me <eos> from all my grief — he who in days of yore <eos> fettered thee fast with fiery chains in woe <eos> there , shorn of glory , bound with torments fierce <eos> in exile hast thou dwelt e'er since the day <eos> when thou didst set at naught the word of god <eos> of heaven 's king ; then did thy woe begin <eos> and to thy exile there shall be no end <eos> but thou shalt still heap up thy wretchedness <eos> to everlasting life , and evermore <eos> thy lot shall grow yet harsher day by day <eos> then fled that fiend who in the years long past <eos> began a deadly feud against his god <eos>
the man for wisdom 's various arts renown 'd <eos> long exercised in woes , o muse ! resound <eos> who , when his arms had wrought the destined fall <eos> of sacred troy , and razed her heaven built wall <eos> wandering from clime to clime , observant stray 'd <eos> their manners noted , and their states survey 'd <eos> on stormy seas unnumber 'd toils he bore <eos> safe with his friends to gain his natal shore <eos> vain toils ! their impious folly dared to prey <eos> on herds devoted to the god of day <eos> the god vindictive doom 'd them never more <eos> ( ah , men unbless 'd !) to touch that natal shore <eos> oh , snatch some portion of these acts from fate <eos> celestial muse ! and to our world relate <eos>
of all the causes which conspire to blind <eos> man 's erring judgment , and misguide the mind <eos> what the weak head with strongest bias rules <eos> is pride , the never failing vice of fools <eos> whatever nature has in worth denied <eos> she gives in large recruits of needless pride <eos> for as in bodies , thus in souls , we find <eos> what wants in blood and spirits , swell 'd with wind <eos> pride , where wit fails , steps in to our defence <eos> and fills up all the mighty void of sense <eos> if once right reason drives that cloud away <eos> truth breaks upon us with resistless day <eos> trust not yourself ; but your defects to know <eos> make use of every friend — and every foe <eos>
he sniffs the chilly air ; ( his dreaming starts <eos> he 's riding in a dusty sussex lane <eos> in quiet september ; slowly night departs <eos> and he 's a living soul , absolved from pain <eos> beyond the brambled fences where he goes <eos> are glimmering fields with harvest piled in sheaves <eos> and tree tops dark against the stars grown pale <eos> then , clear and shrill , a distant farm cock crows <eos> and there 's a wall of mist along the vale <eos> where willows shake their watery sounding leaves <eos> he gazes on it all , and scarce believes <eos> that earth is telling its old peaceful tale <eos> he thanks the blessed world that he was born <eos> then , far away , a lonely note of the horn <eos>
lo as a careful huswife runs to catch <eos> one of her feathered creatures broke away <eos> sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch <eos> in pursuit of the thing she would have stay <eos> whilst her neglected child holds her in chase <eos> cries to catch her whose busy care is bent <eos> to follow that which flies before her face <eos> not prizing her poor infant 's discontent <eos> so run'st thou after that which flies from thee <eos> whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind <eos> but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me <eos> and play the mother 's part , kiss me , be kind <eos> so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will <eos> if thou turn back and my loud crying still <eos>
well can i recall that eve at sligo <eos> and the vacant arches of the abbey <eos> framing the ethereal rose of sunset <eos> round about me silence and gray shadow <eos> peopled with the wraiths of time departed <eos> monks with back thrown cowls who pace the cloisters <eos> now deep mounded , crumbled , clad with ivy <eos> no more from the tower their chimes of silver <eos> will the bells fling o'er the town and river <eos> o'er the garavogue soft gliding seaward <eos> nevermore — save in deep dreams at midnight <eos> death , the immemorial lord of mortals <eos> he is abbot in the aisles of sligo <eos> till the spheres proclaim the resurrection <eos>
“ long on the egyptian coast by calms confined <eos> heaven to my fleet refused a prosperous wind <eos> no vows had we preferr 'd , nor victims slain <eos> for this the gods each favouring gale restrain <eos> jealous , to see their high behests obey 'd <eos> severe , if men the eternal rights evade <eos> high o'er a gulfy sea , the pharian isle <eos> fronts the deep roar of disemboguing nile <eos> her distance from the shore , the course begun <eos> at dawn , and ending with the setting sun <eos> a galley measures ; when the stiffer gales <eos> rise on the poop , and fully stretch the sails <eos> there , anchor 'd vessels safe in harbour lie <eos> whilst limpid springs the failing cask supply <eos>
‘ tis a cruel creed , believe it not <eos> death to the good is a milder lot <eos> they are here ,— they are here ,— that harmless pair <eos> in the yellow sunshine and flowing air <eos> in the light cloud shadows that slowly pass <eos> in the sounds that rise from the murmuring grass <eos> they sit where their humble cottage stood <eos> they walk by the waving edge of the wood <eos> and list to the long accustomed flow <eos> of the brook that wets the rocks below <eos> patient , and peaceful , and passionless <eos> as seasons on seasons swiftly press <eos> they watch , and wait , and linger around <eos> till the day when their bodies shall leave the ground <eos>

thus is his cheek the map of days outworn <eos> when beauty lived and died as flowers do now <eos> before these bastard signs of fair were born <eos> or durst inhabit on a living brow <eos> before the golden tresses of the dead <eos> the right of sepulchres , were shorn away <eos> to live a second life on second head <eos> ere beauty 's dead fleece made another gay <eos> in him those holy antique hours are seen <eos> without all ornament , it self and true <eos> making no summer of another 's green <eos> robbing no old to dress his beauty new <eos> and him as for a map doth nature store <eos> to show false art what beauty was of yore <eos>

ay me ! ay me ! with what another heart <eos> in days far off , and with what other eyes <eos> i used to watch — if i be he that watch 'd <eos> the lucid outline forming round thee ; saw <eos> the dim curls kindle into sunny rings <eos> changed with thy mystic change , and felt my blood <eos> glow with the glow that slowly crimson 'd all <eos> thy presence and thy portals , while i lay <eos> mouth , forehead , eyelids , growing dewy warm <eos> with kisses balmier than half opening buds <eos> of april , and could hear the lips that kiss 'd <eos> whispering i knew not what of wild and sweet <eos> like that strange song i heard apollo sing <eos> while ilion like a mist rose into towers <eos>

when in the chronicle of wasted time <eos> i see descriptions of the fairest wights <eos> and beauty making beautiful old rhyme <eos> in praise of ladies dead , and lovely knights <eos> then in the blazon of sweet beauty 's best <eos> of hand , of foot , of lip , of eye , of brow <eos> i see their antique pen would have expressed <eos> even such a beauty as you master now <eos> so all their praises are but prophecies <eos> of this our time , all you prefiguring <eos> and for they looked but with divining eyes <eos> they had not skill enough your worth to sing <eos> for we which now behold these present days <eos> have eyes to wonder , but lack tongues to praise <eos>
thou radiant coachman , running endless course <eos> fountain of heat , of light the lively source <eos> life of the world , lamp of this universe <eos> heaven 's richest gem : oh , teach me where my verse <eos> may but begin thy praise : alas ! i fare <eos> much like to one that in the clouds doth stare <eos> to count the quails , that with their shadow cover <eos> the italian sea , when soaring hither over <eos> fain of a milder and more fruitful clime <eos> they come with us to pass the summer time <eos> no sooner he begins one shoal to sum <eos> but , more and more , still greater shoals do come <eos> swarm upon swarm , that with their countless number <eos> break off his purpose , and his sense encumber <eos>
but i have looked on pictures made by man <eos> wherein , at first , appeared but chaos wild <eos> so high the art transcended , it beguiled <eos> the eye as formless , and without a plan <eos> until the spirit , brooding o'er , began <eos> to see a purpose rise , like mountains piled <eos> when god said : let the dry earth , undefiled <eos> rise from the waves : it rose in twilight wan <eos> and so i fear thy pictures were too strange <eos> for us to pierce beyond their outmost look <eos> a vapour and a darkness ; a sealed book <eos> an atmosphere too high for wings to range <eos> at god 's designs our spirits pale and change <eos> trembling as at a void , thought cannot brook <eos>
the ladies named were wives of our gallants <eos> so fond of contraband , and smuggled grants <eos> who , vexed to be confined , still praised the dame <eos> for skewing such address to ‘ scape from blame <eos> she soon returned , and with her brought the fair <eos> who , gaily singing , entered free from care <eos> the painter them received with bow and kiss <eos> to praise their beauty he was not remiss <eos> their dress was charming ; all he much admired <eos> their presence frolick , fun , and jest inspired <eos> which no way pleased the husbands in the cage <eos> who saw the freaks with marks of bursting rage <eos> the door half open gave a view complete <eos> how freely he their wives was led to treat <eos>
on many a saddened hearth the evening fire <eos> burns paler as the children 's hour draws near <eos> that joyous hour his song made doubly dear <eos> and tender memories touch the faltering choir <eos> he sings no more on earth ; our vain desire <eos> aches for the voice we loved so long to hear <eos> in dorian flute notes breathing soft and clear <eos> the sweet contralto that could never tire <eos> deafened with listening to a harsher strain <eos> the maenad 's scream , the stark barbarian 's cry <eos> still for those soothing , loving tones we sigh <eos> oh , for our vanished orpheus once again <eos> the shadowy silence hears us call in vain <eos> his lips are hushed ; his song shall never die <eos>
far yonder , where orchards and gardens lie <eos> and dwellings cluster , ‘ tis there men die <eos> they are born , they die , and are buried near <eos> where the populous grave yard lightens the bier <eos> for strict and close are the ties that bind <eos> in death the children of human kind <eos> yea , stricter and closer than those of life <eos> ‘ tis a neighbourhood that knows no strife <eos> they are noiselessly gathered — friend and foe <eos> to the still and dark assemblies below <eos> without a frown or a smile they meet <eos> each pale and calm in his winding sheet <eos> in that sullen home of peace and gloom <eos> crowded , like guests in a banquet room <eos>
ah , well for him if here his suff'rings ceas 'd <eos> and ample hours of rest his pains appeas 'd <eos> but rous 'd again , and sternly bade to rise <eos> and shake refreshing slumber from his eyes <eos> ere his exhausted spirits can return <eos> or through his frame reviving ardour burn <eos> come forth he must , tho ’ limping , maim 'd , and sore <eos> he hears the whip ; the chaise is at the door <eos> the collar tightens , and again he feels <eos> his half heal 'd wounds inflam 'd ; again the wheels <eos> with tiresome sameness in his ears resound <eos> o'er blinding dust , or miles of flinty ground <eos> thus nightly robb 'd , and injur 'd day by day <eos> his piece meal murd'rers wear his life away <eos>
man 's heel is on the almighty 's neck who said <eos> let there be hell , and there was hell — on earth <eos> but not for that may men forget their worth <eos> nay , but much more remember them — who led <eos> the living first from dwellings of the dead <eos> and rent the cerecloths that were wont to engirth <eos> souls wrapped and swathed and swaddled from their birth <eos> with lies that bound them fast from heel to head <eos> among the tombs when wise men all their lives <eos> dwelt , and cried out , and cut themselves with knives <eos> these men , being foolish , and of saints abhorred <eos> beheld in heaven the sun by saints reviled <eos> love , and on earth one everlasting lord <eos> in every likeness of a little child <eos>
who is it that says most , which can say more <eos> than this rich praise , that you alone , are you <eos> in whose confine immured is the store <eos> which should example where your equal grew <eos> lean penury within that pen doth dwell <eos> that to his subject lends not some small glory <eos> but he that writes of you , if he can tell <eos> that you are you , so dignifies his story <eos> let him but copy what in you is writ <eos> not making worse what nature made so clear <eos> and such a counterpart shall fame his wit <eos> making his style admired every where <eos> you to your beauteous blessings add a curse <eos> being fond on praise , which makes your praises worse <eos>
another prospect pleased the builder 's eye <eos> and fashion tenanted ( where fashion wanes <eos> here in the sorrowful suburban lanes <eos> when first these gables rose against the sky <eos> relic of a romantic taste gone by <eos> this stately monument alone remains <eos> vacant , with lichened walls and window panes <eos> blank as the windows of a skull . but i <eos> on evenings when autumnal winds have stirred <eos> in the porch vines , to this gray oracle <eos> have laid a wondering ear and oft times heard <eos> as from the hollow of a stranded shell <eos> old voices echoing ( or my fancy erred <eos> things indistinct , but not insensible <eos>
i dream of you to wake : would that i might <eos> dream of you and not wake but slumber on <eos> nor find with dreams the dear companion gone <eos> as summer ended summer birds take flight <eos> in happy dreams i hold you full in sight <eos> i blush again who waking look so wan <eos> brighter than sunniest day that ever shone <eos> in happy dreams your smile makes day of night <eos> thus only in a dream we are at one <eos> thus only in a dream we give and take <eos> the faith that maketh rich who take or give <eos> if thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake <eos> to die were surely sweeter than to live <eos> though there be nothing new beneath the sun <eos>
the lombard custom was , that when the king <eos> who slept not with his queen , ( a common thing <eos> in other countries too ) , desired to greet <eos> his royal consort , and in bed to meet <eos> a night gown solely o'er his back he threw <eos> and then proceeded to the interview <eos> knocked softly at the door , on which a fair <eos> who waited on the queen with anxious care <eos> allowed the prince to enter ; took his light <eos> ( which only glimmered in the midst of night <eos> then put it out , and quickly left the room <eos> a little lantern to dispel the gloom <eos> with waxen taper that emitted rays <eos> in diff'rent countries various are their ways <eos>
yes ! let the rich deride , the proud disdain <eos> these simple blessings of the lowly train <eos> to me more dear , congenial to my heart <eos> one native charm , than all the gloss of art <eos> spontaneous joys , where nature has its play <eos> the soul adopts , and owns their first born sway <eos> lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind <eos> unenvied , unmolested , unconfined <eos> but the long pomp , the midnight masquerade <eos> with all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed <eos> in these , ere triflers half their wish obtain <eos> the toiling pleasure sickens into pain <eos> and , e'en while fashion 's brightest arts decoy <eos> the heart distrusting asks if this be joy <eos>
unchanged within , to see all changed without <eos> is a blank lot and hard to bear , no doubt <eos> yet why at others ’ wanings should'st thou fret <eos> then only might'st thou feel a just regret <eos> hadst thou withheld thy love or hid thy light <eos> in selfish forethought of neglect and slight <eos> o wiselier then , from feeble yearnings freed <eos> while , and on whom , thou may'st — shine on ! nor heed <eos> whether the object by reflected light <eos> return thy radiance or absorb it quite <eos> and though thou notest from thy safe recess <eos> old friends burn dim , like lamps in noisome air <eos> love them for what they are ; nor love them less <eos> because to thee they are not what they were <eos>
there drew he forth the brand excalibur <eos> and o'er him , drawing it , the winter moon <eos> brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran forth <eos> and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt <eos> for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks <eos> myriads of topaz lights and jacinth work <eos> of subtlest jewellery . he gazed so long <eos> that both his eyes were dazzled , as he stood <eos> this way and that dividing the swift mind <eos> in act to throw : but at the last it seem 'd <eos> better to leave excalibur conceal 'd <eos> there in the many knotted waterflags <eos> that whistled stiff and dry about the marge <eos> so strode he back slow to the wounded king <eos>
some truths there be are better left unsaid <eos> much is there that we may not speak unblamed <eos> on words , as wings , how many joys have fled <eos> the jealous fairies love not to be named <eos> there is an old world tale of one whose bed <eos> a genius graced , to all , save him , unknown <eos> one day the secret passed his lips , and sped <eos> as secrets speed — thenceforth he slept alone <eos> too much , oh ! far too much is told in books <eos> too broad a daylight wraps us all and each <eos> ah ! it is well that , deeper than our looks <eos> some secrets lie beyond conjecture 's reach <eos> ah ! it is well that in the soul are nooks <eos> that will not open to the keys of speech <eos>

how long shall i in mine affliction mourn <eos> a burden to myself , distressed in mind <eos> when shall my interdicted hopes return <eos> from out despair wherein they live confined <eos> when shall her troubled brow charged with disdain <eos> reveal the treasure which her smiles impart <eos> when shall my faith the happiness attain <eos> to break the ice that hath congealed her heart <eos> unto herself , herself my love doth summon <eos> ( if love in her hath any power to move <eos> and let her tell me , as she is a woman <eos> whether my faith hath not deserved her love <eos> i know her heart cannot but judge with me <eos> although her eyes my adversaries be <eos>
son of the lightning and the light that glows <eos> beyond the lightning 's or the morning 's light <eos> soul splendid with all righteous love of right <eos> in whose keen fire all hopes and fears and woes <eos> were clean consumed , and from their ashes rose <eos> transfigured , and intolerable to sight <eos> save of purged eyes whose lids had cast off night <eos> in love 's and wisdom 's likeness when they close <eos> embracing , and between them truth stands fast <eos> embraced of either ; thou whose feet were set <eos> on english earth while this was england yet <eos> our friend that art , our sidney 's friend that wast <eos> heart hardier found and higher than all men 's past <eos> shall we not praise thee though thine own forget <eos>
the king gazed upward at the cloudless sky <eos> whispered a word , and raised his hand on high <eos> and lo ! the signet ring of chrysoprase <eos> on his uplifted finger seemed to blaze <eos> with hidden fire , and rushing from the west <eos> there came a mighty wind , and seized the guest <eos> and lifted him from earth , and on they passed <eos> his shining garments streaming in the blast <eos> a silken banner o'er the walls upreared <eos> a purple cloud , that gleamed and disappeared <eos> then said the angel , smiling : “ if this man <eos> be rajah runjeet sing of hindostan <eos> thou hast done well in listening to his prayer <eos> i was upon my way to seek him there <eos>
go down to hell . this end is good to see <eos> the breath is lightened and the sense at ease <eos> because thou art not ; sense nor breath there is <eos> in what thy body was , whose soul shall be <eos> chief nerve of hell 's pained heart eternally <eos> thou art abolished from the midst of these <eos> that are what thou wast : pius from his knees <eos> blows off the dust that flecked them , bowed for thee <eos> yea , now the long tongued slack lipped litanies <eos> fail , and the priest has no more prayer to sell <eos> now the last jesuit found about thee is <eos> the beast that made thy fouler flesh his cell <eos> time lays his finger on thee , saying , “ cease <eos> here is no room for thee ; go down to hell <eos>
where fortless falmouth , looking o'er her bay <eos> in terror saw the approaching thunders play <eos> the fire begins ; the shells o'er arching fly <eos> and shoot a thousand rainbows thro the sky <eos> on charlestown spires , on bedford roofs they light <eos> groton and fairfield kindle from the flight <eos> norwalk expands the blaze ; o'er reading hills <eos> high flaming danbury the welkin fills <eos> esopus burns , newyork 's delightful fanes <eos> and sea nursed norfolk light the neighboring plains <eos> from realm to realm the smoky volumes bend <eos> reach round the bays and up the streams extend <eos> deep o'er the concave heavy wreaths are roll 'd <eos> and midland towns and distant groves infold <eos>
with the same heart , i said , i 'll answer thee <eos> as those , when thou shalt call me by my name <eos> lo , the vain promise ! is the same , the same <eos> perplexed and ruffled by life 's strategy <eos> when called before , i told how hastily <eos> i dropped my flowers or brake off from a game <eos> to run and answer with the smile that came <eos> at play last moment , and went on with me <eos> through my obedience . when i answer now <eos> i drop a grave thought , break from solitude <eos> yet still my heart goes to thee — ponder how <eos> not as to a single good , but all my good <eos> lay thy hand on it , best one , and allow <eos> that no child 's foot could run fast as this blood <eos>
“ trojans and lycians , and ye dardans , fam 'd <eos> in close encounter , in this press of war <eos> slack not your efforts ; haste to save the son <eos> of clytius , nor let greeks his arms possess <eos> who ‘ mid their throng of ships has nobly fall'n <eos> at ajax , as he spoke , his gleaming spear <eos> he threw , but miss 'd his aim ; yet lycophron <eos> his comrade , of cythera , mastor 's son <eos> ( who flying from cythera 's lovely isle <eos> with guilt of bloodshed , near to ajax dwelt <eos> standing beside the chief , above the ear <eos> he struck , and pierc 'd the brain : from the tall prow <eos> backwards he fell , his limbs relax 'd in death <eos> then ajax , shudd'ring , on his brother call 'd <eos>
the face of all the world is changed , i think <eos> since first i heard the footsteps of thy soul <eos> move still , oh , still , beside me , as they stole <eos> betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink <eos> of obvious death , where i , who thought to sink <eos> was caught up into love , and taught the whole <eos> of life in a new rhythm . the cup of dole <eos> god gave for baptism , i am fain to drink <eos> and praise its sweetness , sweet , with thee anear <eos> the names of country , heaven , are changed away <eos> for where thou art or shalt be , there or here <eos> and this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday <eos> ( the singing angels know ) are only dear <eos> because thy name moves right in what they say <eos>
‘ neath myriad mellow tapers ’ golden glow <eos> a woman stands , proud , insolent and fair <eos> a single gem meshed in the dusk dyed hair <eos> burns like the evening star descending low <eos> adown the dark'ning sky . upon the snow <eos> of her full blossomed breast deep rubies lie <eos> her fragrant presence breathes sweet sorcery <eos> the shimmering saffron satin 's flexile flow <eos> outlines each sinuous curve ; a sensuous smile <eos> a touch that fires to flame each pulsant vein <eos> one draught of eyes more deep than depths of wine <eos> the senses steal , the soul and brain beguile <eos> till all seem merged in feeling ... and again <eos> a circe 's spells transform men into swine <eos>

minds strong by fits , irregularly great <eos> that flash and darken like revolving lights <eos> catch more the vulgar eye unschooled to wait <eos> on the long curve of patient days and nights <eos> bounding a whole life to the circle fair <eos> of orbed fulfilment ; and this balanced soul <eos> so simple in its grandeur , coldly bare <eos> of draperies theatric , standing there <eos> in perfect symmetry of self control <eos> seems not so great at first , but greater grows <eos> still as we look , and by experience learn <eos> how grand this quiet is , how nobly stern <eos> the discipline that wrought through life long throes <eos> that energetic passion of repose <eos>
above this field that shines an eden , lo <eos> that wondrous arch of many married hues <eos> a gorgeous belt , round nature 's lovely waist <eos> sure , earth now seems no place of graves . a wide <eos> gay , blooming paradise ! with moistened face <eos> she smiles , like god , upon this joyous world <eos> a new , wild burst of various harmony <eos> salutes that bow of charm — that orb of glory <eos> thou art the sun and rainbow to my heart <eos> and , as they fade from sight — but do not die <eos> but come to morrow with their wonted charms <eos> thou shalt not die — but gleam o'er me in heaven <eos> with none of all thy beauty , lost or less <eos> can'st thou not sing a song , love , ere it fades <eos>
“ o plant ! from whence i spring ! rever 'd and lov 'd <eos> who soar'st so high a pitch , thou seest as clear <eos> as earthly thought determines two obtuse <eos> in one triangle not contain 'd , so clear <eos> dost see contingencies , ere in themselves <eos> existent , looking at the point whereto <eos> all times are present , i , the whilst i scal 'd <eos> with virgil the soul purifying mount <eos> and visited the nether world of woe <eos> touching my future destiny have heard <eos> words grievous , though i feel me on all sides <eos> well squar 'd to fortune 's blows . therefore my will <eos> were satisfied to know the lot awaits me <eos> the arrow , seen beforehand , slacks its flight <eos>
beyond the seas we know stretch seas unknown <eos> blue and bright colored for our dim and green <eos> beyond the lands we see , stretch lands unseen <eos> with many tinted tangle overgrown <eos> and icebound seas there are like seas of stone <eos> serenely stormless as death lies serene <eos> and lifeless tracks of sand , which intervene <eos> betwixt the lands where living flowers are blown <eos> this dead and living world befits our case <eos> who live and die : we live in wearied hope <eos> we die in hope not dead ; we run a race <eos> to day , and find no present halting place <eos> all things we see lie far within our scope <eos> and still we peer beyond with craving face <eos>
but ah , those leaves !— it was not summer 's mouth <eos> breathed such a gold upon them . and look there <eos> that beech how red ! see , through its boughs , half bare <eos> how low the sun lies in the mid day south <eos> the sweetness is but one pined memory flown <eos> back from our summer , wandering alone <eos> see , see the dead leaves falling ! hear thy heart <eos> which , with the year 's pulse beating swift or slow <eos> takes in the changing world its changing part <eos> return a sigh , an echo sad and low <eos> to the faint , scarcely audible sound <eos> with which the leaf goes whispering to the ground <eos> o love , sad winter lieth at the door <eos> behind sad winter , age — we know no more <eos>
the partial papists would infer from hence <eos> their church , in last resort , should judge the sense <eos> but first they would assume , with wondrous art <eos> themselves to be the whole , who are but part <eos> of that vast frame the church ; yet grant they were <eos> the handers down , can they from thence infer <eos> a right to interpret ? or would they alone <eos> who brought the present , claim it for their own <eos> the book 's a common largess to mankind <eos> not more for them than every man design 'd <eos> the welcome news is in the letter found <eos> the carrier 's not commissioned to expound <eos> it speaks itself , and what it does contain <eos> in all things needful to be known is plain <eos>
two crowned kings , and one that stood alone <eos> with no green weight of laurels round his head <eos> but with sad eyes as one uncomforted <eos> and wearied with man 's never ceasing moan <eos> for sins no bleating victim can atone <eos> and sweet long lips with tears and kisses fed <eos> girt was he in a garment black and red <eos> and at his feet i marked a broken stone <eos> which sent up lilies , dove like , to his knees <eos> now at their sight , my heart being lit with flame <eos> i cried to beatrice , ‘ who are these <eos> and she made answer , knowing well each name <eos> ‘ aeschylos first , the second sophokles <eos> and last ( wide stream of tears !) euripides <eos>

so speaking ceas 'd awhile the enraptur 'd knight <eos> for now the two fair damsels met his sight <eos> each on her arm resplendent vestments brought <eos> fresh from the loom , magnificently wrought <eos> enrob 'd in them , with added grace he mov 'd <eos> as one by nature form 'd to be belov 'd <eos> and , by the fairy to the banquet led <eos> and placed beside her on one genial bed <eos> whiles the twain handmaids every want supplied <eos> cates were his fare to mortal man denied <eos> yet was there one , the foremost of the feast <eos> one food there was far sweeter than the rest <eos> one food there was did feed the warriors flame <eos> for from his lady 's lovely lips it came <eos>

and so they buried lincoln ? strange and vain <eos> has any creature thought of lincoln hid <eos> in any vault ‘ neath any coffin lid <eos> in all the years since that wild spring of pain <eos> ‘ tis false — he never in the grave hath lain <eos> you could not bury him although you slid <eos> upon his clay the cheops pyramid <eos> or heaped it with the rocky mountain chain <eos> they slew themselves ;— they but set lincoln free <eos> in all the earth his great heart beats as strong <eos> shall beat while pulses throb to chivalry <eos> and burn with hate of tyranny and wrong <eos> whoever will may find him , anywhere <eos> save in the tomb . not there — he is not there <eos>
of old i wandered by the river 's side <eos> between whose banks the mighty waters glide <eos> where vast niagara , hurrying to its fall <eos> builds and unbuilds its ever tumbling wall <eos> oft in my dreams i hear the rush and roar <eos> of battling floods , and feel the trembling shore <eos> as the huge torrent , girded for its leap <eos> with bellowing thunders plunges down the steep <eos> not less distinct , from memory 's pictured urn <eos> the gray old rock , the leafy woods , return <eos> robed in their pride the lofty oaks appear <eos> and once again with quickened sense i hear <eos> through the low murmur of the leaves that stir <eos> the tinkling teardrop of la roche qui pleure <eos>
at length they reached the noble pillared hall <eos> within the castle of the holy grail <eos> for here the sacred feast was always kept <eos> and here were gathering the bless è d knights <eos> clothed were they all in tunics of gray blue <eos> the color of the softened light of heaven <eos> with mantles of pale scarlet , flowing free <eos> the very tincture of the blood they served <eos> and on the mantles snow white soaring doves <eos> the symbol of the holy spirit 's gift <eos> and with a solemn joy they took their place <eos> along the tables of communing love <eos> the while from the great vaulted dome above <eos> came ever growing sound of chiming bells <eos>
next rattling dice invite th ’ attentive ear <eos> lords loudly laugh , as loud the bullies swear <eos> the country knight o'th ’ shire sells his estate <eos> and here with heart intrepid meets his fate <eos> so they withdrew to quench their glowing flame <eos> and to preserve the honour of her name <eos> for oh ! sad fate as they ascend the stairs <eos> at the room door her good mamma appears <eos> soon as she spies her child with looks demure <eos> she charges her to keep her vessel pure <eos> miss pertly answers to avoid her doom <eos> mamma , whose hat and wig is in the room <eos> the good old dame yeilds at the just reproach <eos> cries — well my dear , do n't take too much <eos>
the wise world saith i not unlock 'd my heart <eos> when i of thee and thy dear love did write <eos> and would each word of mine to false convert <eos> doing my simple sense a double spite <eos> it saith thou wert but shadow born of nought <eos> but vain creation of an apish rhyme <eos> while , fashion 's fool , my strain 'd invention sought <eos> to better them who best did please the time <eos> but wherefore say they so , and do dear wrong <eos> to thee , whose worth was my sole argument <eos> to me , whose verse ‘ twas truth alone made strong <eos> by that the breast must feel , not brain invent <eos> they who this doubt never such beauty knew <eos> nor what to poet love alone can do <eos>
as the blind man behind his leader walks <eos> lest he should err , or stumble unawares <eos> on what might harm him , or perhaps destroy <eos> i journey 'd through that bitter air and foul <eos> still list'ning to my escort 's warning voice <eos> “ look that from me thou part not . ” straight i heard <eos> voices , and each one seem 'd to pray for peace <eos> and for compassion , to the lamb of god <eos> that taketh sins away . their prelude still <eos> was “ agnus dei , ” and through all the choir <eos> one voice , one measure ran , that perfect seem 'd <eos> the concord of their song . “ are these i hear <eos> spirits , o master ? ” i exclaim 'd ; and he <eos> “ thou aim'st aright : these loose the bonds of wrath <eos>
it is not to be thought of that the flood <eos> of british freedom , which to the open sea <eos> of the world 's praise from dark antiquity <eos> hath flowed , “ with pomp of waters , unwithstood <eos> road by which all might come and go that would <eos> and bear out freights of worth to foreign lands <eos> that this most famous stream in bogs and sands <eos> should perish ; and to evil and to good <eos> be lost for ever . in our halls is hung <eos> armoury of the invincible knights of old <eos> we must be free or die , who speak the tongue <eos> that shakespeare spake ; the faith and morals hold <eos> which milton held . in every thing we are sprung <eos> of earth 's first blood , have titles manifold <eos>
enrapt , the queen gazed on her glorious self <eos> then trembling with the thrill of sudden thought <eos> commanded that the skilful wight be brought <eos> that she might dower him with lands and pelf <eos> then out upon the silent sea lapt shelf <eos> and up the hills and on the downs they sought <eos> him who so well and wondrously had wrought <eos> and with much search found and brought home the elf <eos> but he put by all gifts with sad replies <eos> and from his lips these words flowed forth like wine <eos> “ o queen , i want no gift but thee , ” he said <eos> she heard and looked on him with love lit eyes <eos> gave him her hand , low murmuring , “ i am thine <eos> and at the morrow 's dawning they were wed <eos>
captain sword , like a witless thing <eos> of all under heaven must needs be king <eos> king of kings , and lord of lords <eos> swayer of souls as well as of swords <eos> ruler of speech , and through speech , of thought <eos> and hence to his brain was a madness brought <eos> he madden 'd in east , he madden 'd in west <eos> fiercer for sights of men 's unrest <eos> fiercer for talk , amongst awful men <eos> of their new mighty leader , captain pen <eos> a conqueror strange , who sat in his home <eos> like the wizard that plagued the ships of rome <eos> noiseless , show less , dealing no death <eos> but victories , winged , went forth from his breath <eos>
on th ’ other side the greeks in silence mov 'd <eos> breathing firm courage , bent on mutual aid <eos> as when the south wind o'er the mountain tops <eos> spreads a thick veil of mist , the shepherd 's bane <eos> and friendly to the nightly thief alone <eos> that a stone 's throw the range of vision bounds <eos> so rose the dust cloud , as in serried ranks <eos> with rapid step they mov 'd across the plain <eos> but when th ’ opposing forces near were met <eos> a panther 's skin across his shoulders flung <eos> arm 'd with his bow and sword , in front of all <eos> advanc 'd the godlike paris ; in his hand <eos> he pois 'd two brass tipp 'd jav'lins , and defied <eos> to mortal combat all the chiefs of greece <eos>
it one day happened , that this forward spark <eos> the girl we speak of , met within the park <eos> and to a summer house the fav'rite drew <eos> the course they took the princess chanced to view <eos> as wand'ring near ; but neither swain nor fair <eos> suspicion had , that any one was there <eos> and this gallant most confidently thought <eos> the girl by force , might to his terms be brought <eos> his wretched temper , obstacle to love <eos> and ev'ry bliss bestowed by heav'n above <eos> had oft his hopes of favours lately marred <eos> and fear , with those designs , had also jarred <eos> the girl , howe'er , would likely have been kind <eos> if opportunities had pleased her mind <eos>

a modern hour from london ( as we spin <eos> into a silver thread the miles of space <eos> between us and our goal ) , there is a place <eos> apart from city traffic , dust , and din <eos> green with great trees , where hides a quiet inn <eos> here nelson last looked on the lovely face <eos> which made his world ; and by its magic grace <eos> trailed rosy clouds across each early sin <eos> and , leaning lawnward , is the room where keats <eos> wrote the last one of those immortal songs <eos> ( called by the critics of his day ‘ mere rhymes <eos> a lark , high in the boxwood bough repeats <eos> those lyric strains , to idle passing throngs <eos> there by the little tavern of last times <eos>
by holy motives led , and not chagrin <eos> the hermit never spoke of what he 'd seen <eos> but , from the youth 's discernment , strove to hide <eos> whate'er regarded love , and much beside <eos> the softer sex , with all their magick charms <eos> that fill the feeling bosom with alarms <eos> as years advanced , the boy with care he taught <eos> what suited best his age before him brought <eos> at five he showed him animals and flow'rs <eos> the birds of air , the beasts , their sev'ral pow'rs <eos> and now and then of hell he gave a hint <eos> old satan 's wrath , and what might awe imprint <eos> how formed , and doomed to infamy below <eos> in childhood fear ‘ s the lesson first we know <eos>
o king , whose greatness none can comprehend <eos> whose boundless goodness doth to all extend <eos> light of all beauty ! ocean without ground <eos> that standing flowest , giving dost abound <eos> rich palace , and indweller ever blest <eos> never not working , ever yet in rest <eos> what wit cannot conceive , words say of thee <eos> here , where , as in a mirror , we but see <eos> shadows of shadows , atoms of thy might <eos> still owly eyed while staring on thy light <eos> grant that , released from this earthly jail <eos> and freed of clouds which here our knowledge veil <eos> in heaven 's high temples , where thy praises ring <eos> i may in sweeter notes hear angels sing <eos>
what artful hand the wretch 's form can hit <eos> begot by satan on a m —— ly 's wit <eos> in parties furious at the great man 's nod <eos> and hating none for nothing , but his god <eos> foe to the learn 'd , the virtuous , and the sage <eos> a pimp in youth , an atheist in old age <eos> now plung 'd in bawdry and substantial lyes <eos> now dab'ling in ungodly theories <eos> but so , as swallows skim the pleasing flood <eos> grows giddy , but ne'er drinks to do him good <eos> alike resolv 'd to flatter , or to cheat <eos> nay worship onions , if they cry , come eat <eos> a foe to faith , in revelation blind <eos> and impious much , as dunces are by kind <eos>
so went our boys when edward sixth , the king <eos> chartered christ 's hospital , and died . and so <eos> full fifteen generations in a string <eos> of heirs to his bequest have had to go <eos> thus camden showed , and barnes , and stilling fleet <eos> and richardson , that bade our lovelace be <eos> the little elia thus in newgate street <eos> thus to his genevieve young s. t. c <eos> with thousands else that , wandering up and down <eos> quaint , privileged , liked and reputed well <eos> made the great school a part of london town <eos> patent as paul 's and vital as bow bell <eos> the old school nearing exile , day by day <eos> to certain clay lands somewhere horsham way <eos>
an ill march noon ; the flagstones gray with dust <eos> an all round east wind volleying straws and grit <eos> st. martin 's steps , where every venomous gust <eos> lingers to buffet , or sneap , the passing cit <eos> and in the gutter , squelching a rotten boot <eos> draped in a wrap that , modish ten year syne <eos> partners , obscene with sweat and grease and soot <eos> a horrible hat , that once was just as fine <eos> the drunkard 's mouth a wash for something drinkable <eos> the drunkard 's eye alert for casual toppers <eos> the drunkard 's neck stooped to a lot scarce thinkable <eos> a living , crawling blazoning of hot coppers <eos> he trails his mildews towards a kingdom come <eos> compact of sausage and mash and two o ’ rum <eos>
who 'll , know it ? richard earnestly replied <eos> in jack 's concealment we may both confide <eos> excuse the trick i 've played and ne'er repine <eos> address , force , treachery , in love combine <eos> all are permitted when intrigue ‘ s the word <eos> to hold the contrary were quite absurd <eos> till stratagem was used i naught could gain <eos> but looks and darts from eyes , for all my pain <eos> i 've paid myself ;— would you have done it ?— no <eos> ‘ tis all as might be wished ;— come , smiles bestow <eos> i 'm satisfied , the fault was not with you <eos> in this , to make you wretched , naught i view <eos> why sigh and groan ?— what numbers could i name <eos> who would be happy to be served the same <eos>
it may indeed be phantasy , when i <eos> essay to draw from all created things <eos> deep , heartfelt , inward joy that closely clings <eos> and trace in leaves and flowers that round me lie <eos> lessons of love and earnest piety <eos> so let it be ; and if the wide world rings <eos> in mock of this belief , it brings <eos> nor fear , nor grief , nor vain perplexity <eos> so will i build my altar in the fields <eos> and the blue sky my fretted dome shall be <eos> and the sweet fragrance that the wild flower yields <eos> shall be the incense i will yield to thee <eos> thee only god ! and thou shalt not despise <eos> even me , the priest of this poor sacrifice <eos>
the sire return 'd : my great desire you know <eos> to shield from slaughter and preserve the foe <eos> in bands of concord all their tribes to bind <eos> and live the friend and guardian of mankind <eos> should strife begin , thy youthful arm shall share <eos> the toils of glory thro the walks of war <eos> but o'er their hills to seek alone the foes <eos> to gain their confidence or brave their blows <eos> bend their proud souls to reason 's voice divine <eos> claims hardier limbs and riper years than thine <eos> yet one of heavenly race the task requires <eos> whose mystic rites control the solar fires <eos> so the sooth 'd godhead proves to faithless eyes <eos> his love to man , his empire of the skies <eos>

with herte soor he gooth un to his cofre <eos> and broghte gold un to this philosophre <eos> the value of fyve hundred pound , i gesse <eos> and him bisecheth , of his gentillesse <eos> to graunte him dayes of the remenaunt <eos> and seyde , ‘ maister , i dar wel make avaunt <eos> i failled never of my trouthe as yit <eos> for sikerly my dette shal be quit <eos> towardes yow , how ever that i fare <eos> to goon a begged in my kirtle bare <eos> but wolde ye vouche sauf , up on seurtee <eos> two yeer or three for to respyten me <eos> than were i wel ; for elles moot i selle <eos> myn heritage ; ther is na more to telle <eos>
i would not if i could undo my past <eos> tho ’ for its sake my future is a blank <eos> my past for which i have myself to thank <eos> for all its faults and follies first and last <eos> i would not cast anew the lot once cast <eos> or launch a second ship for one that sank <eos> or drug with sweets the bitterness i drank <eos> or break by feasting my perpetual fast <eos> i would not if i could : for much more dear <eos> is one remembrance than a hundred joys <eos> more than a thousand hopes in jubilee <eos> dearer the music of one tearful voice <eos> that unforgotten calls and calls to me <eos> “ follow me here , rise up , and follow here <eos>
oh , think not i am faithful to a vow <eos> faithless am i save to love 's self alone <eos> were you not lovely i would leave you now <eos> after the feet of beauty fly my own <eos> were you not still my hunger 's rarest food <eos> and water ever to my wildest thirst <eos> i would desert you — think not but i would <eos> and seek another as i sought you first <eos> but you are mobile as the veering air <eos> and all your charms more changeful than the tide <eos> wherefore to be inconstant is no care <eos> i have but to continue at your side <eos> so wanton , light and false , my love , are you <eos> i am most faithless when i most am true <eos>
i thank you , kind and best belov ë d friend <eos> with the same thanks one murmurs to a sister <eos> when , for some gentle favor , he hath kissed her <eos> less for the gifts than for the love you send <eos> less for the flowers than what the flowers convey <eos> if i , indeed , divine their meaning truly <eos> and not unto myself ascribe , unduly <eos> things which you neither meant nor wished to say <eos> oh ! tell me , is the hope then all misplaced <eos> and am i flattered by my own affection <eos> but in your beauteous gift , methought i traced <eos> something above a short lived predilection <eos> and which , for that i know no dearer name <eos> i designate as love , without love 's flame <eos>
run , shepherds , run where bethlehem blest appears <eos> we bring the best of news ; be not dismayed <eos> a saviour there is born more old than years <eos> amidst heaven 's rolling height this earth who stayed <eos> in a poor cottage inned , a virgin maid <eos> a weakling did him bear , who all upbears <eos> there is he poorly swaddled , in manger laid <eos> to whom too narrow swaddlings are our spheres <eos> run , shepherds , run , and solemnize his birth <eos> this is that night — no , day , grown great with bliss <eos> in which the power of satan broken is <eos> in heaven be glory , peace unto the earth <eos> thus singing , through the air the angels swam <eos> and cope of stars re echo ë d the same <eos>
i said : this is a beautiful fresh rose <eos> i said : i will delight me with its scent <eos> will watch its lovely curve of languishment <eos> will watch its leaves unclose , its heart unclose <eos> i said : old earth has put away her snows <eos> all living things make merry to their bent <eos> a flower is come for every flower that went <eos> in autumn ; the sun glows , the south wind blows <eos> so walking in a garden of delight <eos> i came upon one sheltered shadowed nook <eos> where broad leaf shadows veiled the day with night <eos> and there lay snow unmelted by the sun <eos> i answered : take who will the path i took <eos> winter nips once for all ; love is but one <eos>
but soon the morn , on many a distant height <eos> fingers the raven locks of lingering night <eos> the last dark shadows that precede the day <eos> have stripped the splendour from the milky way <eos> and nature seems disturbed by fitful dreams <eos> as one who shudders when the owlet screams <eos> the painful burden of the whippoorwill <eos> like a vague sorrow , floats from hill to hill <eos> along the vales the doleful accents run <eos> where the white vapours dread the burning sun <eos> while human voices stir the haunted air <eos> one sings “ the plough , ” another warbles “ claire <eos> the happy harvesters , a lightsome throng <eos> dispersing homewards , prove the excellence of song <eos>
what were i , love , if i were stripped of thee <eos> if thine eyes shut me out whereby i live <eos> thou , who unto my calmer soul dost give <eos> knowledge , and truth , and holy mystery <eos> wherein truth mainly lies for those who see <eos> beyond the earthly and the fugitive <eos> who in the grandeur of the soul believe <eos> and only in the infinite are free <eos> without thee i were naked , bleak , and bare <eos> as yon dead cedar on the sea cliff 's brow <eos> and nature 's teachings , which come to me now <eos> common and beautiful as light and air <eos> would be as fruitless as a stream which still <eos> slips through the wheel of some old ruined mill <eos>
yet all its varied charms , forever free <eos> from task and tribute , labor yields to thee <eos> no more , when april sheds her fitful rain <eos> the sower 's hand shall cast its flying grain <eos> no more , when autumn strews the flaming leaves <eos> the reaper 's band shall gird its yellow sheaves <eos> for thee alike the circling seasons flow <eos> till the first blossoms heave the latest snow <eos> in the stiff clod below the whirling drifts <eos> in the loose soil the springing herbage lifts <eos> in the hot dust beneath the parching weeds <eos> life 's withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds <eos> its germ entranced in thy unbreathing sleep <eos> till what thou sowest mightier angels reap <eos>
thou , poor heart , sacrificed unto the fairest <eos> hast sent the incense of thy sighs to heaven <eos> and still against her frowns fresh vows repairest <eos> and made thy passions with her beauty even <eos> and you , mine eyes , the agents of my heart <eos> told the dumb message of my hidden grief <eos> and oft , with careful tunes , with silent art <eos> did treat the cruel fair to yield relief <eos> and you , my verse , the advocates of love <eos> have followed hard the process of my case <eos> and urged that title which doth plainly prove <eos> my faith should win , if justice might have place <eos> yet though i see that nought we do can move <eos> ‘ tis not disdain must make me cease to love <eos>
none other fame mine unambitious muse <eos> affected ever but t'eternise thee <eos> all other honours do my hopes refuse <eos> which meaner prized and momentary be <eos> for god forbid i should my papers blot <eos> with mercenary lines with servile pen <eos> praising virtues in them that have them not <eos> basely attending on the hopes of men <eos> no , no , my verse respects not thames , nor theatres <eos> nor seeks it to be known unto the great <eos> but avon , poor in fame , and poor in waters <eos> shall have my song , where delia hath her seat <eos> avon shall be my thames , and she my song <eos> no other prouder brooks shall hear my wrong <eos>
it is not with a hope my feeble praise <eos> can add one moment 's honor to thy own <eos> that with thy mighty name i grace these lays <eos> i seek to glorify myself alone <eos> for that some precious favor thou hast shown <eos> to my endeavor in a bygone time <eos> and by this token i would have it known <eos> thou art my friend , and friendly to my rhyme <eos> it is my dear ambition now to climb <eos> still higher in thy thought ,— if my bold pen <eos> may thrust on contemplations more sublime <eos> but i am thirsty for thy praise , for when <eos> we gain applauses from the great in name <eos> we seem to be partakers of their fame <eos>
nat started the bowling ( and take my word , misters <eos> there 's no bowling like it for underhand twisters <eos> and what with the pace and the screw and the aim <eos> it was pretty hard work , was that blunderby game <eos> with nat in the field to look after the ball <eos> ‘ twas a terrible struggle to get runs at all <eos> though they hit out their hardest a regular stunner <eos> ‘ twas rare that it reckoned for more than a oner <eos> ‘ twas seldom indeed that they troubled the scorer <eos> to put down a twoer , a threer , or fourer <eos> and as for a lost ball , a fiver , or sixer <eos> the blunderby boys were not up to the trick , sir <eos> still they struggled full well , and at sixty the score <eos> the last wicket fell , and the innings was o'er <eos>
since there is no escape , since at the end <eos> my body will be utterly destroyed <eos> this hand i love as i have loved a friend <eos> this body i tended , wept with and enjoyed <eos> since there is no escape even for me <eos> who love life with a love too sharp to bear <eos> the scent of orchards in the rain , the sea <eos> and hours alone too still and sure for prayer <eos> since darkness waits for me , then all the more <eos> let me go down as waves sweep to the shore <eos> in pride ; and let me sing with my last breath <eos> in these few hours of light i lift my head <eos> life is my lover — i shall leave the dead <eos> if there is any way to baffle death <eos>
how yesterday is long ago ! the past <eos> is a fixed infinite distance from to day <eos> and bygone things , the first lived as the last <eos> in irreparable sameness far away <eos> how the to be is infinitely ever <eos> out of the place wherein it will be now <eos> like the seen wave yet far up in the river <eos> which reaches not us , but the new waved flow <eos> this thing time is , whose being is having none <eos> the equable tyrant of our different fates <eos> who could not be bought off by a shattered sun <eos> or tricked by new use of our careful dates <eos> this thing time is , that to the grave will bear <eos> my heart , sure but of it and of my fear <eos>

a bolt , a potent one , and brought at need <eos> that b lf r is a ready ganymede <eos> and yet — and yet — ah , well , upon my soul <eos> a troublous function is the thunderer 's r ô le <eos> ‘ tis vastly fine , of course ; if fate would smile <eos> i fancy that the cloud compeller 's style <eos> would suit me sweetly ; just the line i love <eos> resolute rule 's the appanage of a jove <eos> but shelley 's dismal demogorgon 's self <eos> that solemn , shadowy , stern , oracular elf <eos> plus obstinate prometheus , did not play <eos> such mischief as the parties do to day <eos> with law and order . who would be a god <eos> when force forsakes his bolt , and fear his nod <eos>
no glory makes me glorious or glad <eos> nor pleasure may to pleasure me dispose <eos> no comfort can revive my senses sad <eos> nor hope enfranchise me with one repose <eos> nor in her absence taste i one delight <eos> nor in her presence am i well content <eos> was never time gave term to my despite <eos> nor joy that dried the tears of my lament <eos> nor hold i hope of weal in memory <eos> nor have i thought to change my restless grief <eos> nor doth my conquest yield me sovereignty <eos> nor hope repose , nor confidence relief <eos> for why ? she sorts her frowns and favours so <eos> as when i gain or lose i cannot know <eos>

and why shou 'd not a man adore his wife <eos> since she 's the only comfort of his life <eos> a gift presented by the gods above <eos> a lively emblem of the charms of love <eos> all o 're divine , a heaven , here below <eos> man 's paradice , where joys in plenty flow <eos> no shame , but honour does bless 'd wedlock crown <eos> and ushers in both glory and renown <eos> sweet pretty babes , the product of each charm <eos> in marriage bed protects us from all harm <eos> their innocence like lambs and doves appear <eos> which make our hearts and minds quite void of care <eos> no sorrow can lay hold of man or wife <eos> where love and virtue is the rule of life <eos>
when simple macer , now of high renown <eos> first sought a poet 's fortune in the town <eos> ‘ twas all the ambition his high soul could feel <eos> to wear red stockings , and to dine with steele <eos> some ends of verse his betters might afford <eos> and gave the harmless fellow a good word <eos> set up with these , he ventured on the town <eos> and with a borrow 'd play , out did poor crowne <eos> there he stopp 'd short , nor since has writ a tittle <eos> but has the wit to make the most of little <eos> like stunted , hide bound trees that just have got <eos> sufficient sap at once to bear and rot <eos> now he begs verse , and what he gets commends <eos> not of the wits , his foes , but fools , his friends <eos>

there was a youth around whose early way <eos> white angels hung in converse and sweet choir <eos> teaching in summer clouds his thought to stray <eos> in cloud and far horizon to desire <eos> his life was nursed in beauty , like the stream <eos> born of clear showers and the mountain dew <eos> close under snow clad summits where they gleam <eos> forever pure against heaven 's orient blue <eos> within the city 's shades he walked at last <eos> faint and more faint in sad recessional <eos> down the dim corridors of time outworn <eos> a chorus ebbed from that forsaken past <eos> a hymn of glories fled beyond recall <eos> with the lost heights and splendor of life 's morn <eos>

and weep not , though the beautiful decay <eos> within thy heart , as daily in thine eyes <eos> thy heart must have its autumn , its pale skies <eos> leading , mayhap , to winter 's dim dismay <eos> yet doubt not . beauty doth not pass away <eos> her form departs not , though her body dies <eos> secure beneath the earth the snowdrop lies <eos> waiting the spring 's young resurrection day <eos> through the kind nurture of the winter cold <eos> nor seek thou by vain effort to revive <eos> the summer time , when roses were alive <eos> do thou thy work — be willing to be old <eos> thy sorrow is the husk that doth infold <eos> a gorgeous june , for which thou need'st not strive <eos>

he spoke , and enid easily believed <eos> like simple noble natures , credulous <eos> of what they long for , good in friend or foe <eos> there most in those who most have done them ill <eos> and when they reached the camp the king himself <eos> advanced to greet them , and beholding her <eos> though pale , yet happy , asked her not a word <eos> but went apart with edyrn , whom he held <eos> in converse for a little , and returned <eos> and , gravely smiling , lifted her from horse <eos> and kissed her with all pureness , brother like <eos> and showed an empty tent allotted her <eos> and glancing for a minute , till he saw her <eos> pass into it , turned to the prince , and said <eos>
then from the depths , in bitterness she cried <eos> ‘ hell is on earth , and heaven is but a dream <eos> and human life a troubled aimless stream <eos> and god is nowhere . would god so deride <eos> a loving creature 's faith ? ’ a voice replied <eos> ‘ the stream flows onward to the source supreme <eos> where things that are replace the things that seem <eos> and where the deeds of all past lives abide <eos> once at thy door love languished and was spurned <eos> who sorrow plants , must garner sorrow 's sheaf <eos> no prayers can change the seedling in the sod <eos> by thine own heart love 's anguish must be learned <eos> pass on , and know , as one made wise by grief <eos> that in thyself dwells heaven and hell and god <eos>

was it the proud full sail of his great verse <eos> bound for the prize of ( all too precious ) you <eos> that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse <eos> making their tomb the womb wherein they grew <eos> was it his spirit , by spirits taught to write <eos> above a mortal pitch , that struck me dead <eos> no , neither he , nor his compeers by night <eos> giving him aid , my verse astonished <eos> he nor that affable familiar ghost <eos> which nightly gulls him with intelligence <eos> as victors of my silence cannot boast <eos> i was not sick of any fear from thence <eos> but when your countenance filled up his line <eos> then lacked i matter , that enfeebled mine <eos>
this is my play 's last scene ; here heavens appoint <eos> my pilgrimage 's last mile ; and my race <eos> idly yet quickly run , hath this last pace <eos> my span 's last inch , my minute 's latest point <eos> and gluttonous death will instantly unjoint <eos> my body and soul , and i shall sleep a space <eos> but my ever waking part shall see that face <eos> whose fear already shakes my every joint <eos> then as my soul to heaven , her first seat , takes flight <eos> and earth born body in the earth shall dwell <eos> so fall my sins , that all may have their right <eos> to where they 're bred , and would press me to hell <eos> impute me righteous ; thus purged of evil <eos> for thus i leave the world , the flesh , the devil <eos>

how thick the clouds of night are rang 'd o'er head <eos> confounding darkness o'er the earth is spread <eos> the clouded moon her cheering count'nance hides <eos> and feeble stars , between the ragged sides <eos> of broken clouds , with unavailing ray <eos> look thro ’ to mock the trav'ller on his way <eos> tree , bush , and rugged rock , and hollow dell <eos> in deeper shades their forms confus'dly tell <eos> to cheat the weary wand'rer ' s doubtful eye <eos> whilst chilly passing winds come ruffling by <eos> and tangled briars perplex the darken 'd pass <eos> and slimy reptiles glimmer on the grass <eos> and stinging night flies spend their cursed spite <eos> unhospitable are thy shades , o night <eos>
they give thy letter to me , even now <eos> i read and seem as if i heard thee speak <eos> the master of thy galley still unlades <eos> gift after gift ; they block my court at last <eos> and pile themselves along its portico <eos> royal with sunset , like a thought of thee <eos> and one white she slave from the group dispersed <eos> of black and white slaves ( like the checker work <eos> pavement , at once my nation 's work and gift <eos> now covered with this settle down of doves <eos> one lyric woman , in her crocus vest <eos> woven of sea wools , with her two white hands <eos> commends to me the strainer and the cup <eos> thy lip hath bettered ere it blesses mine <eos>
love , loyallest and lordliest born of things <eos> immortal that shouldst be , though all else end <eos> in plighted hearts of fearless friend with friend <eos> whose hand may curb or clip thy plume plucked wings <eos> not grief 's nor time 's : though these be lords and kings <eos> crowned , and their yoke bid vassal passions bend <eos> they may not pierce the spirit of sense , or blend <eos> quick poison with the soul 's live watersprings <eos> the true clear heart whose core is manful trust <eos> fears not that very death may turn to dust <eos> love lit therein as toward a brother born <eos> if one touch make not all its fine gold rust <eos> if one breath blight not all its glad ripe corn <eos> and all its fire be turned to fire of scorn <eos>
— “ and where is my cat ? ” a vixen squalled <eos> “ yes , where are our cats ? ” the witches bawled <eos> and began to call them all by name <eos> as fast as they called the cats , they came <eos> there was bob tailed tommy and long tailed tim <eos> and wall eyed jacky and green eyed jim <eos> and splay foot benny and slim legged beau <eos> and skinny and squally , and jerry and joe <eos> and many another that came at call <eos> it would take too long to count them all <eos> all black ,— one could hardly tell which was which <eos> but every cat knew his own old witch <eos> and she knew hers as hers knew her <eos> ah , did n't they curl their tails and purr <eos>
from these digressions upon love and glory <eos> ‘ tis time we were returning to our story <eos> i only meant , in a few words , to tell you <eos> ( for fear my heroine 's conduct should repel you <eos> that if she jests , for instance , out of season <eos> perhaps there is a good substantial reason <eos> sir gawayne , had he seen the stranger wink <eos> and seen the lady blushing , you may think <eos> might have been spared a most unhappy lot <eos> perhaps you 're right ;— but peradventure not <eos> i give you but a hint , for half the art <eos> of narrative is holding back a part <eos> and if without reserve i gave my best <eos> in the first canto , who would read the rest <eos>
kindness gave solitude the lovely light <eos> she loved , and made less terrible black midnight <eos> even as a bird its unlearned music pours <eos> though windows all be blind and shut the doors <eos> and sings on still though no faint sound be heard <eos> but wind and leaves and another lonely bird <eos> so poured she untaught kindness all around <eos> and in that human music comfort found <eos> music her own and music heard from others <eos> prime music of all lovers , children , mothers <eos> precarious music between all men sounding <eos> the horror of silent and dark powers confounding <eos> singing that music she could bravely live <eos> hearing it , find less sorrow to forgive <eos>
the dead and dying in his pathway lie <eos> before him ranks divide and squadrons fly <eos> with stalwart arm , and with unerring aim <eos> he adds new glories to his former fame <eos> reaps the reward of all his toil : for now <eos> fresh laurels twine around his youthful brow <eos> but what avail they ? for the fatal dart <eos> of death has lodged within that hoping heart <eos> the lofty head that wore the waving crest <eos> now sadly droops upon the bleeding breast <eos> that mighty arm , upraised in power and pride <eos> falls feebly down , and casts its sword aside <eos> the laurel wreath entwines that brow in vain <eos> for , lo ! the hero lies among the slain <eos>
the other meets me in the public throng <eos> her hair streams backward from her loose attire <eos> she hath a trumpet and an eye of fire <eos> she points me downward , steadily and long <eos> “ there is thy grave — arise , my son , be strong <eos> hands are upon thy crown — awake , aspire <eos> to immortality ; heed not the lyre <eos> of the enchantress , nor her poppy song <eos> but in the stillness of the summer calm <eos> tremble for what is godlike in thy being <eos> listen a while , and thou shall hear the psalm <eos> of victory sung by creatures past thy seeing <eos> and from far battle fields there comes the neighing <eos> of dreadful onset , though the air is balm <eos>
thus he who shakes olympus with his nod <eos> then gave to paeon ’ s care the bleeding god <eos> with gentle hand the balm he pour ’ d around <eos> and heal ’ d the immortal flesh , and closed the wound <eos> as when the fig ’ s press ’ d juice , infused in cream <eos> to curds coagulates the liquid stream <eos> sudden the fluids fix the parts combined <eos> such , and so soon , the ethereal texture join ’ d <eos> cleansed from the dust and gore , fair hebe dress ’ d <eos> his mighty limbs in an immortal vest <eos> glorious he sat , in majesty restored <eos> fast by the throne of heaven ’ s superior lord <eos> juno and pallas mount the bless ’ d abodes <eos> their task perform ’ d , and mix among the gods <eos>
the shelves are full , all other themes are sped <eos> hackneyed and worn to the last flimsy thread <eos> satire has long since done his best , and curst <eos> and loathsome ribaldry has done his worst <eos> fancy has sported all her powers away <eos> in tales , in trifles , and in children 's play <eos> and ‘ tis the sad complaint , and almost true <eos> whate'er we write , we bring forth nothing new <eos> ‘ twere new indeed to see a bard all fire <eos> touched with a coal from heaven , assume the lyre <eos> and tell the world , still kindling as he sung <eos> with more than mortal music on his tongue <eos> that he who died below , and reigns above <eos> inspires the song , and that his name is love <eos>
arion , when , through tempests cruel wracke <eos> he forth was thrown into the greedy seas <eos> through the sweet musick which his harp did make <eos> allur 'd a dolphin him from death to ease <eos> but my rude musick , which was wont to please <eos> some dainty eares , cannot , with any skill <eos> the dreadfull tempest of her wrath appease <eos> nor move the dolphin from her stubborn will <eos> but in her pride she dooth persever still <eos> all carelesse how my life for her decayes <eos> yet with one word she can it save or spill <eos> to spill were pitty , but to save were prayse <eos> chuse rather to be praysd for doing good <eos> then to be blam 'd for spilling guiltlesse blood <eos>
meanwhile the arts , in second infancy <eos> rise in some distant clime , and then , perchance <eos> some bold adventurer , fill 'd with golden dreams <eos> steering his bark through trackless solitudes <eos> where , to his wandering thoughts , no daring prow <eos> hath ever ploughed before ,— espies the cliffs <eos> of fallen albion .— to the land unknown <eos> he journeys joyful ; and perhaps descries <eos> some vestige of her ancient stateliness <eos> then he , with vain conjecture , fills his mind <eos> of the unheard of race , which had arrived <eos> at science in that solitary nook <eos> far from the civil world ; and sagely sighs <eos> and moralizes on the state of man <eos>
milton ! thou shouldst be living at this hour <eos> england hath need of thee ; she is a fen <eos> of stagnant waters : altar , sword , and pen <eos> fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower <eos> have forfeited their ancient english dower <eos> of inward happiness . we are selfish men <eos> oh ! raise us up , return to us again <eos> and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power <eos> thy soul was like a star , and dwelt apart <eos> thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea <eos> pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free <eos> so didst thou travel on life 's common way <eos> in cheerful godliness ; and yet thy heart <eos> the lowliest duties on itself did lay <eos>
great god whom i shall carve from this gray stone <eos> wherein thou liest , hid to all but me <eos> grant thou that when my art hath made thee known <eos> and others bow , i shall not worship thee <eos> but , as i pray thee now , then let me pray <eos> some greater god , — like thee to be conceived <eos> within my soul , — for strength to turn away <eos> from his new altar , when , that task achieved <eos> he , too , stands manifest . yea , let me yearn <eos> from dream to grander dream ! let me not rest <eos> content at any goal ! still bid me spurn <eos> each transient triumph on the eternal quest <eos> abjuring godlings whom my hand hath made <eos> for deity , revealed , but unportrayed <eos>
poet ! if on a lasting fame be bent <eos> thy unperturbing hopes , thou will not roam <eos> too far from thine own happy heart and home <eos> cling to the lowly earth , and be content <eos> so shall thy name be dear to many a heart <eos> so shall the noblest truths by thee be taught <eos> the flower and fruit of wholesome human thought <eos> bless the sweet labors of thy gentle art <eos> the brightest stars are nearest to the earth <eos> and we may track the mighty sun above <eos> even by the shadow of a slender flower <eos> always , o bard , humility is power <eos> and thou mayst draw from matters of the hearth <eos> truths wide as nations , and as deep as love <eos>
to speak of him in language of our own <eos> is not for us too daringly to try <eos> but , saviour , we can read thy history <eos> upon the faces round thy humble throne <eos> and as the flower among the grass makes known <eos> what summer suns have warmed it from the sky <eos> as every human smile and human sigh <eos> is witness that we do not live alone <eos> so in that company — in those sweet tears <eos> the first born of a rugged melted heart <eos> in those gaunt chains for ever torn apart <eos> and in the words that weeping mother hears <eos> we read the story of two thousand years <eos> and know thee somewhat , saviour , as thou art <eos>
the scourge of life , and death 's extreme disgrace <eos> the smoke of hell , the monster called pain <eos> long shamed to be accursed in every place <eos> by them who of his rude resort complain <eos> like crafty wretch , by time and travel taught <eos> his ugly evil in others ’ good to hide <eos> late harbours in her face , whom nature wrought <eos> as treasure house where her best gifts do bide <eos> and so by privilege of sacred seat <eos> a seat where beauty shines and virtue reigns <eos> he hopes for some small praise , since she hath great <eos> within her beams wrapping his cruel stains <eos> ah , saucy pain , let not thy terror last <eos> more loving eyes she draws , more hate thou hast <eos>
alack what poverty my muse brings forth <eos> that having such a scope to show her pride <eos> the argument all bare is of more worth <eos> than when it hath my added praise beside <eos> o blame me not if i no more can write <eos> look in your glass and there appears a face <eos> that over goes my blunt invention quite <eos> dulling my lines , and doing me disgrace <eos> were it not sinful then striving to mend <eos> to mar the subject that before was well <eos> for to no other pass my verses tend <eos> than of your graces and your gifts to tell <eos> and more , much more than in my verse can sit <eos> your own glass shows you , when you look in it <eos>

and beatrice : “ the first diving soul <eos> that ever the first virtue fram 'd , admires <eos> within these rays his maker . ” like the leaf <eos> that bows its lithe top till the blast is blown <eos> by its own virtue rear 'd then stands aloof <eos> so i , the whilst she said , awe stricken bow 'd <eos> then eagerness to speak embolden 'd me <eos> and i began : “ o fruit ! that wast alone <eos> mature , when first engender 'd ! ancient father <eos> that doubly seest in every wedded bride <eos> thy daughter by affinity and blood <eos> devoutly as i may , i pray thee hold <eos> converse with me : my will thou seest ; and i <eos> more speedily to hear thee , tell it not <eos>
the battle quickly raged ; alike they erred <eos> the pirates slaughter loved , and blood preferred <eos> and , long accustomed to the stormy tide <eos> were most expert , and on their skill relied <eos> in numbers , too , superior they were found <eos> but hisipal 's valour greatly shone around <eos> and kept the combat undecided long <eos> at length grifonio , wond'rous large and strong <eos> with twenty sturdy , pirates got on board <eos> and many soon lay gasping by the sword <eos> where'er he trod , grim death and horrour reigned <eos> at length , the round the noble hispal gained <eos> his nervous arm laid many wretches low <eos> rage marked his eyes , whene'er he dealt a blow <eos>
about a mile behind the viny banks <eos> how sweet it was , upon a sloping green <eos> sunspread , and shaded with a branching screen <eos> to lie in peace half murmuring words of thanks <eos> to see the mountains on each other climb <eos> with spaces for rich meadows flowery bright <eos> the winding river freshening the sight <eos> at intervals , the trees in leafy prime <eos> the distant village roofs of blue and white <eos> with intersections of quaint fashioned beams <eos> all slanting crosswise , and the feudal gleams <eos> of ruined turrets , barren in the light <eos> to watch the changing clouds , like clime in clime <eos> oh sweet to lie and bless the luxury of time <eos>
point to the summits where the brave have bled <eos> where every village claims its glorious dead <eos> say , when their bosoms met the bayonet 's shock <eos> their only corselet was the rustic frock <eos> say , when they mustered to the gathering horn <eos> the titled chieftain curled his lip in scorn <eos> yet , when their leader bade his lines advance <eos> no musket wavered in the lion 's glance <eos> say , when they fainted in the forced retreat <eos> they tracked the snow drifts with their bleeding feet <eos> yet still their banners , tossing in the blast <eos> bore ever ready , faithful to the last <eos> through storm and battle , till they waved again <eos> on yorktown 's hills and saratoga 's plain <eos>
he had no children , who for love of men <eos> being god , endured of gods such things as thou <eos> father ; nor on his thunder beaten brow <eos> fell such a woe as bows thine head again <eos> twice bowed before , though godlike , in man 's ken <eos> and seen too high for any stroke to bow <eos> save this of some strange god 's that bends it now <eos> the third time with such weight as bruised it then <eos> fain would grief speak , fain utter for love 's sake <eos> some word ; but comfort who might bid thee take <eos> what god in your own tongue shall talk with thee <eos> showing how all souls that look upon the sun <eos> shall be for thee one spirit and thy son <eos> and thy soul 's child the soul of man to be <eos>
the heavenly branches did i see arise <eos> out of the fresh and lustie lawrell tree <eos> amidst the yong greene wood : of paradise <eos> some noble plant i thought my selfe to see <eos> such store of birds therein yshrowded were <eos> chaunting in shade their sundrie melodie <eos> that with their sweetnes i was ravish't nere <eos> while on this lawrell fixed was mine eie <eos> the skie gan everie where to overcast <eos> and darkned was the welkin all about <eos> when sudden flash of heavens fire out brast <eos> and rent this royall tree quite by the roote <eos> which makes me much and ever to complaine <eos> for no such shadow shalbe had againe <eos>
that day we brought our beautiful one to lie <eos> in the green peace within your gates , he came <eos> to give us greeting , boyish and kind and shy <eos> and , stricken as we were , we blessed his name <eos> yet , like the creature of light that had been ours <eos> soon of the sweet earth disinherited <eos> he too must join , even with the year 's old flowers <eos> the unanswering generations of the dead <eos> so stand we friends for you , who stood our friend <eos> through him that day ; for now through him you know <eos> that though where love was , love is till the end <eos> love , turned of death to longing , like a foe <eos> strikes : when the ruined heart goes forth to crave <eos> mercy of the high , austere , unpitying grave <eos>
march , tho ’ the hours of promise with bright ray <eos> may gild thy noons , yet , on wild pinion borne <eos> loud winds more often rudely wake thy morn <eos> and harshly hymn thy early closing day <eos> still the chill 'd earth wears , with her tresses shorn <eos> her bleak , grey garb :— yet not for this we mourn <eos> nor , as in winter 's more enduring sway <eos> with festal viands , and associates gay <eos> arm ‘ gainst the skies ;— nor shun the piercing gale <eos> but , with blue cheeks , and with disorder 'd hair <eos> meet its rough breath ;— and peep for primrose pale <eos> or lurking violet , under hedges bare <eos> and , thro ’ long evenings , from our lares <eos> the thrift of stinted grate , and sullen flame <eos>
since the first look that led me to this error <eos> to this thoughts ’ maze to my confusion tending <eos> still have i lived in grief , in hope , in terror <eos> the circle of my sorrows never ending <eos> yet cannot leave her love that holds me hateful <eos> her eyes exact it , though her heart disdains me <eos> see what reward he hath that serves th'ungrateful <eos> so true and loyal love no favour gains me <eos> still must i whet my young desires abated <eos> upon the flint of such a heart rebelling <eos> and all in vain ; her pride is so innated <eos> she yields no place at all for pity 's dwelling <eos> oft have i told her that my soul did love her <eos> and that with tears ; yet all this will not move her <eos>
to live in hell , and heaven to behold <eos> to welcome life , and die a living death <eos> to sweat with heat , and yet be freezing cold <eos> to grasp at stars , and lie the earth beneath <eos> to treat a maze that never shall have end <eos> to burn in sighs , and starve in daily tears <eos> to climb a hill , and never to descend <eos> giants to kill , and quake at childish fears <eos> to pine for food , and watch th ’ hesperian tree <eos> to thirst for drink , and nectar still to draw <eos> to live accurs 'd whom men hold blest to be <eos> and weep those wrongs which never creature saw <eos> if this be love , if love in these be founded <eos> my heart is love , for these in it are grounded <eos>
my love amazed did blush herself to see <eos> pictured by art , all naked as she was <eos> “ how could the painter know so much by me <eos> or art effect what he hath brought to pass <eos> it is not like he naked me hath seen <eos> or stood so nigh for to observe so much <eos> no , sweet ; his eyes so near have never been <eos> nor could his hands by art have cunning such <eos> i showed my heart , wherein you printed were <eos> you , naked you , as here you painted are <eos> in that my love your picture i must wear <eos> and show't to all , unless you have more care <eos> then take my heart , and place it with your own <eos> so shall you naked never more be known <eos>
thou who didst waken from his summer dreams <eos> the blue mediterranean , where he lay <eos> lull 'd by the coil of his crystalline streams <eos> beside a pumice isle in baiae 's bay <eos> and saw in sleep old palaces and towers <eos> quivering within the wave 's intenser day <eos> all overgrown with azure moss and flowers <eos> so sweet , the sense faints picturing them ! thou <eos> for whose path the atlantic 's level powers <eos> cleave themselves into chasms , while far below <eos> the sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear <eos> the sapless foliage of the ocean , know <eos> thy voice , and suddenly grow gray with fear <eos> and tremble and despoil themselves : o hear <eos>
not mine own fears , nor the prophetic soul <eos> of the wide world , dreaming on things to come <eos> can yet the lease of my true love control <eos> supposed as forfeit to a confined doom <eos> the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured <eos> and the sad augurs mock their own presage <eos> incertainties now crown themselves assured <eos> and peace proclaims olives of endless age <eos> now with the drops of this most balmy time <eos> my love looks fresh , and death to me subscribes <eos> since spite of him i 'll live in this poor rhyme <eos> while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes <eos> and thou in this shalt find thy monument <eos> when tyrants ’ crests and tombs of brass are spent <eos>
thus can my love excuse the slow offence <eos> of my dull bearer , when from thee i speed <eos> from where thou art , why should i haste me thence <eos> till i return of posting is no need <eos> o what excuse will my poor beast then find <eos> when swift extremity can seem but slow <eos> then should i spur though mounted on the wind <eos> in winged speed no motion shall i know <eos> then can no horse with my desire keep pace <eos> therefore desire ( of perfect'st love being made <eos> shall neigh ( no dull flesh ) in his fiery race <eos> but love , for love , thus shall excuse my jade <eos> since from thee going , he went wilful slow <eos> towards thee i 'll run , and give him leave to go <eos>
but he lay in peace , with his solemn eye <eos> looking far through the mists of futurity <eos> a smile gleamed over the death dew that lay <eos> on his withered cheek as life ebbed away <eos> a darkness lay on his forehead vast <eos> but the light of expectancy o'er it was cast <eos> a light that shone from the coming day <eos> travelling unseen to the east away <eos> in his cloudy robes that lay shadowing wide <eos> i stretched myself motionless by his side <eos> and his eyes with their calm , unimpassioned power <eos> soothing my heart like an evening shower <eos> led in a spectral , far billowing train <eos> the hours of the past through my spirit again <eos>
perhaps some village poet waited there <eos> who day and night toiled hard in metres rare <eos> to sing the deeds and virtues of his prince <eos> and trace them on the leaves of that lone palm <eos> which stood close by his humble cottage home <eos> perhaps with faces that bespoke deep grief <eos> a troop of farmers there had come to tell <eos> to their sport loving prince the havoc wrought <eos> upon their toiling cattle by wild beasts <eos> that nightly from their hill abodes came down <eos> to feast on them . and in that motley crowd <eos> were servants of the state and many more <eos> who long had waited merely for a glimpse <eos> of their just ruler d é sing holding court <eos>
o lest the world should task you to recite <eos> what merit lived in me that you should love <eos> after my death ( dear love ) forget me quite <eos> for you in me can nothing worthy prove <eos> unless you would devise some virtuous lie <eos> to do more for me than mine own desert <eos> and hang more praise upon deceased i <eos> than niggard truth would willingly impart <eos> o lest your true love may seem false in this <eos> that you for love speak well of me untrue <eos> my name be buried where my body is <eos> and live no more to shame nor me , nor you <eos> for i am shamed by that which i bring forth <eos> and so should you , to love things nothing worth <eos>

the lab'ring poor , in spite of double pay <eos> are saucy , mutinous , and beggarly <eos> so lavish of their money and their time <eos> that want of forecast is the nation 's crime <eos> good drunken company is their delight <eos> and what they get by day they spend by night <eos> dull thinking seldom does their heads engage <eos> but drink their youth away , and hurry on old age <eos> empty of all good husbandry and sense <eos> and void of manners most when void of pence <eos> their strong aversion to behaviour 's such <eos> they always talk too little or too much <eos> so dull , they never take the pains to think <eos> and seldom are good natured but in drink <eos>

some foreign writers , some our own despise <eos> the ancients only , or the moderns prize <eos> thus wit , like faith , by each man is applied <eos> to one small sect , and all are damned beside <eos> meanly they seek the blessing to confine <eos> and force that sun but on a part to shine <eos> which not alone the southern wit sublimes <eos> but ripens spirits in cold northern climes <eos> which from the first has shone on ages past <eos> enlights the present , and shall warm the last <eos> though each may feel increases and decays <eos> and see now clearer and now darker days <eos> regard not then if wit be old or new <eos> but blame the false , and value still the true <eos>

deep in the shady sadness of a vale <eos> far sunken from the healthy breath of morn <eos> far from the fiery noon , and eve 's one star <eos> sat gray hair 'd saturn , quiet as a stone <eos> still as the silence round about his lair <eos> forest on forest hung about his head <eos> like cloud on cloud . no stir of air was there <eos> not so much life as on a summer 's day <eos> robs not one light seed from the feather 'd grass <eos> but where the dead leaf fell , there did it rest <eos> a stream went voiceless by , still deadened more <eos> by reason of his fallen divinity <eos> spreading a shade : the naiad ‘ mid her reeds <eos> press 'd her cold finger closer to her lips <eos>
the latian virgins , valiant with despair <eos> arm 'd on the tow'rs , the common danger share <eos> so much of zeal their country 's cause inspir 'd <eos> so much camilla 's great example fir 'd <eos> poles , sharpen 'd in the flames , from high they throw <eos> with imitated darts , to gall the foe <eos> their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath <eos> and crowd each other to be first in death <eos> meantime to turnus , ambush 'd in the shade <eos> with heavy tidings came th ’ unhappy maid <eos> “ the volscians overthrown , camilla kill 'd <eos> the foes , entirely masters of the field <eos> like a resistless flood , come rolling on <eos> the cry goes off the plain , and thickens to the town <eos>
i scarcely grieve , o nature ! at the lot <eos> that pent my life within a city 's bounds <eos> and shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds <eos> perhaps i had not learned , if some lone cot <eos> had nursed a dreamy childhood , what the mart <eos> taught me amid its turmoil ; so my youth <eos> had missed full many a stern but wholesome truth <eos> here , too , o nature ! in this haunt of art <eos> thy power is on me , and i own thy thrall <eos> there is no unimpressive spot on earth <eos> the beauty of the stars is over all <eos> and day and darkness visit every hearth <eos> clouds do not scorn us : yonder factory 's smoke <eos> looked like a golden mist when morning broke <eos>
when i consider how my light is spent <eos> ere half my days , in this dark world and wide <eos> and that one talent which is death to hide <eos> lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent <eos> to serve therewith my maker , and present <eos> my true account , lest he returning chide <eos> “ doth god exact day labor , light denied <eos> i fondly ask ; but patience , to prevent <eos> that murmur , soon replies : “ god doth not need <eos> either man 's work , or his own gifts ; who best <eos> bear his mild yoke , they serve him best ; his state <eos> is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed <eos> and post o'er land and ocean without rest <eos> they also serve who only stand and wait <eos>
oh ! stars , that through the darkness smile and gleam <eos> like glory rays that gild the dreary gloom <eos> or like some soul world glance or mystic dream <eos> that from the mind 's vast store of summer bloom <eos> we feel at times — your influence comes to raise <eos> our hearts above earth 's night of doubts and haze <eos> for all these holy thoughts of peace , that spring <eos> from hearts at rest from daytime cares and pains <eos> are messengers of love , sent from the king <eos> that in the blessed country lives and reigns <eos> and from its gates , above the starry heaven <eos> come mystic rays that round our pathway stray <eos> his guiding lights that to our souls are given <eos> foretastes that cheer and brighten all our way <eos>

sole lord of lords and very king of kings <eos> he sits within the desert , carved in stone <eos> inscrutable , colossal , and alone <eos> and ancienter than memory of things <eos> graved on his front the sacred beetle clings <eos> disdain sits on his lips ; and in a frown <eos> scorn lives upon his forehead for a crown <eos> the affrighted ostrich dare not dust her wings <eos> anear this presence . the long caravan 's <eos> dazed camels stop , and mute the bedouins stare <eos> this symbol of past power more than man 's <eos> presages doom . kings look — and kings despair <eos> their sceptres tremble in their jewelled hands <eos> and dark thrones totter in the baleful air <eos>
to whom in answer thus the guardian god <eos> “ on him , old man , nor dogs nor birds have fed <eos> but by the ship of peleus ’ son he lies <eos> within the tent ; twelve days he there hath lain <eos> nor hath corruption touch 'd his flesh , nor worms <eos> that wont to prey on men in battle slain <eos> the corpse , indeed , with each returning morn <eos> around his comrade 's tomb achilles drags <eos> yet leaves it still uninjur 'd ; thou thyself <eos> mightst see how fresh , as dew besprent , he lies <eos> from blood stains cleans 'd , and clos 'd his many wounds <eos> for many a lance was buried in his corpse <eos> so , e'en in death , the blessed gods above <eos> who lov 'd him well , protect thy noble son <eos>
me my own fate to lasting sorrow doometh <eos> thy woes are birds of passage , transitory <eos> thy spirit , circled with a living glory <eos> in summer still a summer joy resumeth <eos> alone my hopeless melancholy gloometh <eos> like a lone cypress , through the twilight hoary <eos> from an old garden where no flower bloometh <eos> one cypress on an inland promontory <eos> but yet my lonely spirit follows thine <eos> as round the rolling earth night follows day <eos> but yet thy lights on my horizon shine <eos> into my night when thou art far away <eos> i am so dark , alas ! and thou so bright <eos> when we two meet there 's never perfect light <eos>
thus live undying through the lapse of time <eos> the solemn legends of the warrior 's clime <eos> like egypt 's pyramid or paestum 's fane <eos> they stand the heralds of the voiceless plain <eos> yet not like them , for time , by slow degrees <eos> saps the gray stone and wears the embroidered frieze <eos> and isis sleeps beneath her subject nile <eos> and crumbled neptune strews his dorian pile <eos> but art 's fair fabric , strengthening as it rears <eos> its laurelled columns through the mist of years <eos> as the blue arches of the bending skies <eos> still gird the torrent , following as it flies <eos> spreads , with the surges bearing on mankind <eos> its starred pavilion o'er the tides of mind <eos>
in english glades they watch the cyprian glow <eos> and all the maenad melodies they know <eos> they hear strange voices in a london street <eos> and track the silver gleam of rushing feet <eos> and these are things that come not to the view <eos> of slippered dons who read a codex through <eos> o honeyed poet , will you praise no more <eos> the moonlit garden and the midnight shore <eos> brother , have you forgotten how to sing <eos> the story of that weak and cautious king <eos> who reigned two hundred years in trebizond <eos> you who would ever strive to pierce beyond <eos> love 's ecstacy , life 's vision , is it well <eos> we should not know the tales you have to tell <eos>
what secret thing of splendour or of shade <eos> surmised in all those wandering ways wherein <eos> man , led of love and life and death and sin <eos> strays , climbs , or cowers , allured , absorbed , afraid <eos> might not the strong and sunlike sense invade <eos> of that full soul that had for aim to win <eos> light , silent over time 's dark toil and din <eos> life , at whose touch death fades as dead things fade <eos> o spirit of man , what mystery moves in thee <eos> that he might know not of in spirit , and see <eos> the heart within the heart that seems to strive <eos> the life within the life that seems to be <eos> and hear , through all thy storms that whirl and drive <eos> the living sound of all men 's souls alive <eos>
oft , when the world imagine women stray <eos> the sylphs thro ’ mystic mazes guide their way <eos> thro ’ all the giddy circle they pursue <eos> and old impertinence expel by new <eos> what tender maid but must a victim fall <eos> to one man 's treat , but for another 's ball <eos> when florio speaks what virgin could withstand <eos> if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand <eos> with varying vanities , from ev'ry part <eos> they shift the moving toyshop of their heart <eos> where wigs with wigs , with sword knots sword knots strive <eos> beaux banish beaux , and coaches coaches drive <eos> this erring mortals levity may call <eos> oh blind to truth ! the sylphs contrive it all <eos>

he said , nor did apollo not obey <eos> his sire 's commands ; from ida 's heights he flew <eos> like to a falcon , swooping on a dove <eos> swiftest of birds ; then priam 's son he found <eos> the godlike hector , stretch 'd at length no more <eos> but sitting , now to consciousness restor 'd <eos> with recognition looking on his friends <eos> the cold sweat dried , nor gasping now for breath <eos> since by the will of aegis bearing jove <eos> to life new waken 'd ; close beside him stood <eos> the far destroyer , and address 'd him thus <eos> “ hector , thou son of priam , why apart <eos> from all thy comrades art thou sitting here <eos> feeble and faint ? what trouble weighs thee down <eos>
i do not now complain of my disgrace <eos> o cruel fair one ! fair with cruel crost <eos> nor of the hour , season , time , nor place <eos> nor of my foil , for any freedom lost <eos> nor of my courage , by misfortune daunted <eos> nor of my wit , by overweening struck <eos> nor of my sense , by any sound enchanted <eos> nor of the force of fiery pointed hook <eos> nor of the steel that sticks within my wound <eos> nor of my thoughts , by worser thoughts defaced <eos> nor of the life i labour to confound <eos> but i complain , that being thus disgraced <eos> fired , feared , frantic , fettered , shot through , slain <eos> my death is such as i may not complain <eos>
loudly we shouted , and living and dying <eos> bore them all backward with strength and strong crying <eos> and caleb struck zedek hard at the throat <eos> and japhia of lachish zebulon smote <eos> the war swords and axes were clashing and groaning <eos> the fallen were fighting and foaming and moaning <eos> the war spears were breaking , the war horns were braying <eos> ere the hands of the slayers were sated with slaying <eos> and deep in the grasses grown gory and sodden <eos> the treaders of all men were trampled and trodden <eos> and over them , routed and reeled like cattle <eos> high over the turn of the tide of the battle <eos> high over noises that deafen and cover us <eos> rang the deliverer 's voice out over us <eos>

you , while in life , are honoured as divine <eos> and vows and oaths are taken at your shrine <eos> so rome pays homage to her man of men <eos> ne'er seen on earth before , ne'er to be seen again <eos> but this wise nation , which for once thinks true <eos> that nought in greece or here can rival you <eos> to all things else a different test applies <eos> and looks on living worth with jaundiced eyes <eos> while , as for ancient models , take the code <eos> which to the ten wise men our fathers owed <eos> the treaties made ‘ twixt gabii 's kings and home 's <eos> the pontiffs ’ books , the bards ’ forgotten tomes <eos> they 'll swear the muses framed them every one <eos> in close divan on alba 's helicon <eos>

woe ! woe to me , on me return the smart <eos> my burning tongue hath bred my mistress pain <eos> for oft in pain , to pain my painful heart <eos> with her due praise did of my state complain <eos> i praised her eyes , whom never chance doth move <eos> her breath , which makes a sour answer sweet <eos> her milken breasts , the nurse of child like love <eos> her legs , o legs ! her aye well stepping feet <eos> pain heard her praise , and full of inward fire <eos> ( first sealing up my heart as prey of his <eos> he flies to her , and , boldened with desire <eos> her face , this age 's praise , the thief doth kiss <eos> o pain ! i now recant the praise i gave <eos> and swear she is not worthy thee to have <eos>
i watched them long in my curious dream <eos> till they stood by the border of the stream <eos> then , just as i thought , the two ways met <eos> but all the brethren were talking yet <eos> and would talk on , till the heaving tide <eos> carried them over , side by side <eos> side by side , for the way was one <eos> the toilsome journey of life was done <eos> and priest and quaker , and all who died <eos> came out alike on the other side <eos> no forms or crosses , or books had they <eos> no gowns of silk , or suits of gray <eos> no creeds to guide them , or mss <eos> for all had put on “ christ 's righteousness <eos>
trust not the treason of those smyling lookes <eos> untill ye have their guylefull traynes well tryde <eos> for they are lyke but unto golden hookes <eos> that from the foolish fish theyr bayts do hyde <eos> so she with flattring smyles weake harts doth guyde <eos> unto her love , and tempte to theyr decay <eos> whome , being caught , she kills with cruell pryde <eos> and feeds at pleasure on the wretched pray <eos> yet even whylst her bloody hands them slay <eos> her eyes looke lovely , and upon them smyle <eos> that they take pleasure in their cruell play <eos> and , dying , doe themselves of payne beguyle <eos> o mighty charm ! which makes men love theyr bane <eos> and thinck they dy with pleasure , live with payne <eos>
o sacred , just , inevitable scorn <eos> strong child of righteous judgment , whom with grief <eos> the rent heart bears , and wins not yet relief <eos> seeing of its pain so dire a portent born <eos> must thou not spare one sheaf of all the corn <eos> one doit of all the treasure ? not one sheaf <eos> not one poor doit of all ? not one dead leaf <eos> of all that fell and left behind a thorn <eos> is man so strong that one should scorn another <eos> is any as god , not made of mortal mother <eos> that love should turn in him to gall and flame <eos> nay : but the true is not the false heart 's brother <eos> love cannot love disloyalty : the name <eos> that else it wears is love no more , but shame <eos>
if thou hadst been a painter , what fresh looks <eos> what shining of pent glories , what new grace <eos> had burst upon us from the great earth 's face <eos> how had we read , as in new languaged books <eos> clear love of god in lone retreating nooks <eos> a lily , as thy hand its form would trace <eos> were plainly seen god 's child , of lower race <eos> and , o my heart , blue hills ! and grassy brooks <eos> thy soul lay to all undulations bare <eos> answering in waves . each morn the sun did rise <eos> and god 's world woke beneath life giving skies <eos> thou sawest clear thy father 's meanings there <eos> ‘ mid earth 's ideal , and expressions rare <eos> the ideal man , with the eternal eyes <eos>
thou canst not die whilst any zeal abound <eos> in feeling hearts than can conceive these lines <eos> though thou a laura hast no petrarch found <eos> in base attire yet clearly beauty shines <eos> and i though born within a colder clime <eos> do feel mine inward heat as great — i know it <eos> he never had more faith , although more rhyme <eos> i love as well though he could better show it <eos> but i may add one feather to thy fame <eos> to help her flight throughout the fairest isle <eos> and if my pen could more enlarge thy name <eos> then shouldst thou live in an immortal style <eos> for though that laura better limn è d be <eos> suffice , thou shalt be loved as well as she <eos>
within a thick and spreading hawthorn bush <eos> that overhung a mole hill large and round <eos> i heard from morn to morn a merry thrush <eos> sing hymns of rapture , while i drank the sound <eos> with joy ; and oft , an unintruding guest <eos> i watch 'd her secret toils from day to day <eos> how true she warp 'd the moss to form her nest <eos> and modell 'd it within with wool and clay <eos> and bye and bye , like heath bells gilt with dew <eos> there lay her shining eggs as bright as flowers <eos> ink spotted over , shells of green and blue <eos> and there i witness 'd , in the summer hours <eos> a brood of nature 's minstrels chirp and fly <eos> glad as the sunshine and the laughing sky <eos>
fair star of evening , splendor of the west <eos> star of my country ! on the horizon 's brink <eos> thou hangest , stooping , as might seem , to sink <eos> on england 's bosom ; yet well pleas 'd to rest <eos> meanwhile , and be to her a glorious crest <eos> conspicuous to the nations . thou , i think <eos> should'st be my country 's emblem ; and should'st wink <eos> bright star ! with laughter on her banners , drest <eos> in thy fresh beauty . there ! that dusky spot <eos> beneath thee , it is england ; there it lies <eos> blessings be on you both ! one hope , one lot <eos> one life , one glory ! i , with many a fear <eos> for my dear country , many heartfelt sighs <eos> among men who do not love her linger here <eos>
o , i implore , ye gods ! who did attend <eos> æ ne ä s ,— who made fire and sword retreat <eos> ye native deities of latium 's soil <eos> quirinus , founder of the walls of rome <eos> mars , of quirinus never conquer 'd , sire <eos> vesta , held sacred midst the c æ sars ’ gods <eos> domestic ph œ bus , with chaste vesta plac 'd <eos> and jove , who guards the high tarpei ä n walls <eos> with all whom pious poets may invoke <eos> slow may that day arrive , and older far <eos> than what our age may see , when to the clouds <eos> his glorious head shall mount , quitting this globe <eos> he rules so well , and our beseeching prayers <eos> bending with condescending ear to grant <eos>
that scarce a piece i publish in a year <eos> idle perhaps to you i may appear <eos> but rather , that i write at all , admire <eos> when i am often robbed of days entire <eos> now with my friends the evening i must spend <eos> to those preferred my compliments must send <eos> now at the witnessing a will make one <eos> hurried from this to that , my morning 's gone <eos> some office must attend ; or else some ball <eos> or else my lawyer 's summons to the hall <eos> now a rehearsal , now a concert hear <eos> and now a latin play at westminster <eos> home after ten return , quite tir 'd and dos 'd <eos> when is the piece , you want , to be compos 'd <eos>
but they came ,— the wind and sea <eos> and rain and thunder , that in giant glee <eos> sang o'er the lightnings pale , as to and fro <eos> they writhed , like stricken angels !— white as snow <eos> roll 'd billow after billow , and the tide <eos> came forward as an army deep and wide <eos> to charge with all its waters . there was heard <eos> a murmur far and far , of those that stirr 'd <eos> within the great encampment of the sea <eos> and dark they were , and lifted terribly <eos> their water spouts like banners . it was grand <eos> to see the black battalions , hand in hand <eos> striding to conflict , and their helmets bent <eos> below their foamy plumes magnificent <eos>
so , as thou wert the seed and not the flower <eos> having no form or comeliness , in chief <eos> sharing thy thoughts with thine acquaintance grief <eos> thou wert despised , rejected in thine hour <eos> of loneliness and god triumphant power <eos> oh , not three days alone , glad slumber brief <eos> that from thy travail brought thee sweet relief <eos> lay'st thou , outworn , beneath thy stony bower <eos> but three and thirty years , a living seed <eos> thy body lay as in a grave indeed <eos> a heavenly germ dropt in a desert wide <eos> buried in fallow soil of grief and need <eos> ‘ mid earthquake storms of fiercest hate and pride <eos> by woman 's tears bedewed and glorified <eos>
so was it done , and ogier , armed right well <eos> sleeping , was borne away by some strong spell <eos> and set upon the flemish coast ; and thence <eos> turned to st. omer 's , with a doubtful sense <eos> of being in some wild dream , the while he knew <eos> that great delight forgotten was his due <eos> that all which there might hap was of small worth <eos> so on he went , and sometimes unto mirth <eos> did his attire move the country folk <eos> but oftener when strange speeches from him broke <eos> concerning men and things for long years dead <eos> he filled the listeners with great awe and dread <eos> for in such wild times as these people were <eos> are men soon moved to wonder and to fear <eos>
meanwhile , ere yet on stockholm 's towery height <eos> the morning planet shed its trembling light <eos> a troop , with bernheirn , thro ’ the portals past <eos> whose polish 'd arms a glimmering splendor cast <eos> no single breath the general stillness stirr 'd <eos> their trampling feet alone the warder heard <eos> and follow 'd with his sight the dusty cloud <eos> that in its mantle wrapp 'd the marching crowd <eos> o'er crackling bushes scud the warrior train <eos> and pass with haste the solitary plain <eos> ‘ till the broad sun discover 'd from afar <eos> the dawning lustre of his golden car <eos> beneath the covert of a neighbouring wood <eos> they paus 'd awhile , and their swift march renew 'd <eos>
if my dear love were but the child of state <eos> it might for fortune 's bastard be unfathered <eos> as subject to time 's love or to time 's hate <eos> weeds among weeds , or flowers with flowers gathered <eos> no it was builded far from accident <eos> it suffers not in smiling pomp , nor falls <eos> under the blow of thralled discontent <eos> whereto th ’ inviting time our fashion calls <eos> it fears not policy that heretic <eos> which works on leases of short numbered hours <eos> but all alone stands hugely politic <eos> that it nor grows with heat , nor drowns with showers <eos> to this i witness call the fools of time <eos> which die for goodness , who have lived for crime <eos>
when all the hungry pain of love i bear <eos> and in poor lightless thought but burn and burn <eos> and wit goes hunting wisdom everywhere <eos> yet can no word of revelation learn <eos> when endlessly the scales of yea and nay <eos> in dreadful motion fall and rise and fall <eos> when all my heart in sorrow i could pay <eos> until at last were left no tear at all <eos> then if with tame or subtle argument <eos> companions come and draw me to a place <eos> where words are but the tappings of content <eos> and life spreads all her garments with a grace <eos> i curse that ease , and hunger in my heart <eos> back to my pain and lonely to depart <eos>
blown in the morning , thou shalt fade ere noon <eos> what boots a life which in such haste forsakes thee <eos> thou'rt wondrous frolic , being to die so soon <eos> and passing proud a little color makes thee <eos> if thee thy brittle beauty so deceives <eos> know then the thing that swells thee is thy bane <eos> for the same beauty cloth , in bloody leaves <eos> the sentence of thy early death contain <eos> some clown 's coarse lungs will poison thy sweet flower <eos> if by the careless plough thou shalt be torn <eos> and many herods lie in wait each hour <eos> to murder thee as soon as thou art born <eos> nay , force thy bud to blow — their tyrant breath <eos> anticipating life , to hasten death <eos>
so when the pretty rill a place espies <eos> where with the pebbles she would wantonize <eos> and that her upper stream so much doth wrong her <eos> to drive her thence , and let her play no longer <eos> if she with too loud mutt'ring ran away <eos> as being much incens 'd to leave her play <eos> a western , mild and pretty whispering gale <eos> came dallying with the leaves along the dale <eos> and seem 'd as with the water it did chide <eos> because it ran so long unpacified <eos> yea , and methought it bade her leave that coil <eos> or he would choke her up with leaves and soil <eos> whereat the riv'let in my mind did weep <eos> and hurl 'd her head into a silent deep <eos>
from you have i been absent in the spring <eos> when proud pied april ( dressed in all his trim <eos> hath put a spirit of youth in every thing <eos> that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him <eos> yet nor the lays of birds , nor the sweet smell <eos> of different flowers in odour and in hue <eos> could make me any summer 's story tell <eos> or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew <eos> nor did i wonder at the lily 's white <eos> nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose <eos> they were but sweet , but figures of delight <eos> drawn after you , you pattern of all those <eos> yet seemed it winter still , and you away <eos> as with your shadow i with these did play <eos>
strong time and fire swift change , with lightnings clad <eos> and shod with thunders of reverberate years <eos> have filled with light and sound of hopes and fears <eos> the space of many a season , since i had <eos> grace of good hap to make my spirit glad <eos> once communing with thine : and memory hears <eos> the bright voice yet that then rejoiced mine ears <eos> sees yet the light of eyes that spake , and bade <eos> fear not , but hope , though then time 's heart were weak <eos> and heaven by hell shade stricken , and the range <eos> of high born hope made questionable and strange <eos> as twilight trembling till the sunlight speak <eos> thou sawest the sunrise and the storm in one <eos> break : seest thou now the storm compelling sun <eos>
check every outflash , every ruder sally <eos> of thought and speech ; speak low , and give up wholly <eos> thy spirit to mild minded melancholy <eos> this is the place . through yonder poplar alley <eos> below , the blue green river windeth slowly <eos> but in the middle of the sombre valley <eos> the crisp è d waters whisper musically <eos> and all the haunted place is dark and holy <eos> the nightingale , with long and low preamble <eos> warbled from yonder knoll of solemn larches <eos> and in and out the woodbine 's flowery arches <eos> the summer midges wove their wanton gambol <eos> and all the white stemmed pinewood slept above <eos> when in this valley first i told my love <eos>
the fields have faded , the groves look dead <eos> the summer is gone , its beauty has fled <eos> and there breathes a low and plaintive sound <eos> from each stream and solemn wood around <eos> in unison with their tone , my breast <eos> with a spirit of kindred gloom is opprest <eos> and the sighs burst forth as i gaze , the while <eos> on the crumbling stone of the reverend pile <eos> and list to the sounds of the moaning wind <eos> as it stirs the old ivy boughs entwined <eos> sighs mournful along through chancel and nave <eos> and shakes the loose panel and architrave <eos> while the mouldering branches and withered leaves <eos> are rustling around the moss grown eaves <eos>
“ ‘ o friends , a thousand ways frail mortals lead <eos> to the cold tomb , and dreadful all to tread <eos> but dreadful most , when by a slow decay <eos> pale hunger wastes the manly strength away <eos> why cease ye then to implore the powers above <eos> and offer hecatombs to thundering jove <eos> why seize ye not yon beeves , and fleecy prey <eos> arise unanimous ; arise and slay <eos> and if the gods ordain a safe return <eos> to phoebus shrines shall rise , and altars burn <eos> but should the powers that o'er mankind preside <eos> decree to plunge us in the whelming tide <eos> better to rush at once to shades below <eos> than linger life away , and nourish woe <eos>
when i consider how my light is spent <eos> ere half my days in this dark world and wide <eos> and that one talent which is death to hide <eos> lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent <eos> to serve therewith my maker , and present <eos> my true account , lest he , returning , chide <eos> ‘ doth god exact day labour , light denied <eos> i fondly ask : but patience , to prevent <eos> that murmur soon replies : ‘ god doth not need <eos> either man 's work or his own gifts . who best <eos> bear his mild yoke , they serve him best . his state <eos> is kingly : thousands at his bidding speed <eos> and post o'er land and ocean without rest <eos> they also serve who only stand and wait <eos>
i cannot syllable that unworded praise <eos> an ashen sapling bending in thy wind <eos> uplifting in thy light new budded leaves <eos> nor for myself nor any other raise <eos> my boughs in music , though the woodland heaves <eos> o with what ease of pain at length resigned <eos> what hope to the old inheritance restored <eos> thy praise it is that men at last are glad <eos> long unaccustomed brightness in their eyes <eos> needs must seem beautiful in thine , bright lord <eos> and to forget the part that sorrow had <eos> in every shadowed breast , where still it lies <eos> is there not praise in such forgetfulness <eos> for to grieve less means not that love is less <eos>
where silent zephyrs sported with the dust <eos> of the bastille , i sate in the open sun <eos> and from the rubbish gathered up a stone <eos> and pocketed the relic , [ g ] in the guise <eos> of an enthusiast ; yet , in honest truth <eos> i looked for something that i could not find <eos> affecting more emotion than i felt <eos> for ‘ tis most certain , that these various sights <eos> however potent their first shock , with me <eos> appeared to recompense the traveller 's pains <eos> less than the painted magdalene of le brun , [ h <eos> a beauty exquisitely wrought , with hair <eos> dishevelled , gleaming eyes , and rueful cheek <eos> pale and bedropped with everflowing tears <eos>
afar in the desert i love to ride <eos> with the silent bush boy alone by my side <eos> o'er the brown karroo , where the bleating cry <eos> of the springbok 's fawn sounds plaintively <eos> and the timorous quagga 's shrill whistling neigh <eos> is heard by the fountain at twilight gray <eos> where the zebra wantonly tosses his mane <eos> with wild hoof scouring the desolate plain <eos> and the fleet footed ostrich over the waste <eos> speeds like a horseman who travels in haste <eos> hieing away to the home of her rest <eos> where she and her mate have scooped their nest <eos> far hid from the pitiless plunderer 's view <eos> in the pathless depths of the parched karroo <eos>
small , busy flames play through the fresh laid coals <eos> and their faint cracklings o'er our silence creep <eos> like whispers of the household gods that keep <eos> a gentle empire o'er fraternal souls <eos> and while , for rhymes , i search around the poles <eos> your eyes are fix 'd , as in poetic sleep <eos> upon the lore so voluble and deep <eos> that aye at fall of night our care condoles <eos> this is your birth day tom , and i rejoice <eos> that thus it passes smoothly , quietly <eos> many such eves of gently whisp'ring noise <eos> may we together pass , and calmly try <eos> what are this world 's true joys ,— ere the great voice <eos> from its fair face , shall bid our spirits fly <eos>
if i could trust mine own self with your fate <eos> shall i not rather trust it in god 's hand <eos> without whose will one lily doth not stand <eos> nor sparrow fall at his appointed date <eos> who numbereth the innumerable sand <eos> who weighs the wind and water with a weight <eos> to whom the world is neither small nor great <eos> whose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned <eos> searching my heart for all that touches you <eos> i find there only love and love 's goodwill <eos> helpless to help and impotent to do <eos> of understanding dull , of sight most dim <eos> and therefore i commend you back to him <eos> whose love your love 's capacity can fill <eos>
i went to listen to my teacher friend <eos> o friend above , thanks for the friend below <eos> who having been made wise , deep things to know <eos> with brooding spirit over them doth bend <eos> until they waken words , as wings , to send <eos> their seeds far forth , seeking a place to grow <eos> the lesson past , with quiet foot i go <eos> and towards his silent room , expectant wend <eos> seeking a blessing , even leave to dwell <eos> for some eternal minutes in his eyes <eos> and he smiled on me in his loving wise <eos> his hand spoke friendship , satisfied me well <eos> my presence was some pleasure , i could tell <eos> then forth we went beneath the smoky skies <eos>
much have i travell 'd in the realms of gold <eos> and many goodly states and kingdoms seen <eos> round many western islands have i been <eos> which bards in fealty to apollo hold <eos> oft of one wide expanse had i been told <eos> that deep brow 'd homer rul 'd as his demesne <eos> yet did i never breathe its pure serene <eos> till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold <eos> then felt i like some watcher of the skies <eos> when a new planet swims into his ken <eos> or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes <eos> he star 'd at the pacific — and all his men <eos> looked at each other with a wild surmise <eos> silent , upon a peak in darien <eos>
now roll like winged storms the solid lines <eos> the clarion thunders and the battle joins <eos> thick flames in vollied flashes load the air <eos> and echoing mountains give the noise of war <eos> sulphureous clouds rise reddening round the height <eos> and veil the skies , and wrap the sounding fight <eos> soon from the skirts of smoke , where thousands toil <eos> ranks roll away and into light recoil <eos> starke pours upon them in a storm of lead <eos> his hosted swains bestrew the field with dead <eos> pierce with strong bayonets the german reins <eos> whelm two battalions in their captive chains <eos> bid baum , with wounds enfeebled , quit the field <eos> and breyman next his gushing lifeblood yield <eos>
lyke as a huntsman , after weary chace <eos> seeing the game from him escapt away <eos> sits downe to rest him in some shady place <eos> with panting hounds , beguiled of their pray <eos> so , after long pursuit and vaine assay <eos> when i all weary had the chace forsooke <eos> the gentle deer returnd the selfe same way <eos> thinking to quench her thirst at the next brooke <eos> there she , beholding me with mylder looke <eos> sought not to fly , but fearlesse still did bide <eos> till i in hand her yet halfe trembling tooke <eos> and with her own goodwill her fyrmely tyde <eos> strange thing , me seemd , to see a beast so wyld <eos> so goodly wonne , with her owne will beguyld <eos>
are these wild thoughts , thus fettered in my rhymes <eos> indeed the product of my heart and brain <eos> how strange that on my ear the rhythmic strain <eos> falls like faint memories of far off times <eos> when did i feel the sorrow , act the part <eos> which i have striv'n to shadow forth in song <eos> in what dead century swept that mingled throng <eos> of mighty pains and pleasures through my heart <eos> not in the yesterdays of that still life <eos> which i have passed so free and far from strife <eos> but somewhere in this weary world i know <eos> in some strange land , beneath some orient clime <eos> i saw or shared a martyrdom sublime <eos> and felt a deeper grief than any later woe <eos>
my weary life , that lives unsatisfied <eos> on the foiled off brink of being e ’ er but this <eos> to whom the power to will hath been denied <eos> and the will to renounce doth also miss <eos> my sated life , with having nothing sated <eos> in the motion of moving pois è d aye <eos> within its dreams from its own dreams abated <eos> this life let the gods change or take away <eos> for this endless succession of empty hours <eos> like deserts after deserts , voidly one <eos> doth undermine the very dreaming powers <eos> and dull even thought ’ s active inaction <eos> tainting with fore unwilled will the dreamed act <eos> twice thus removed from the unobtained fact <eos>
some time ago from rome , in smart array <eos> a younger brother homeward bent his way <eos> not much improved , as frequently the case <eos> with those who travel to that famous place <eos> upon the road oft finding , where he stayed <eos> delightful wines , and handsome belle or maid <eos> with careless ease he loitered up and down <eos> one day there passed him in a country town <eos> attended by a page , a lady fair <eos> whose charming form and all engaging air <eos> at once his bosom fired with fond desire <eos> and nearer still , her beauties to admire <eos> he most gallantly saw her safely home <eos> attentions charm the sex where'er we roam <eos>
shame is a shadow cast by sin : yet shame <eos> itself may be a glory and a grace <eos> refashioning the sin disfashioned face <eos> a nobler bruit than hollow sounded fame <eos> a new lit lustre on a tarnished name <eos> one virtue pent within an evil place <eos> strength for the fight , and swiftness for the race <eos> a stinging salve , a life requickening flame <eos> a salve so searching we may scarcely live <eos> a flame so fierce it seems that we must die <eos> an actual cautery thrust into the heart <eos> nevertheless , men die not of such smart <eos> and shame gives back what nothing else can give <eos> man to himself ,— then sets him up on high <eos>
then all astonied with this mighty ghoast <eos> an hideous bodie , big and strong , i sawe <eos> with side * long beard , and locks down hanging loast <eos> sterne face , and front full of sat ú rnlike awe <eos> who , leaning on the belly of a pot <eos> pourd foorth a water , whose out gushing flood <eos> ran bathing all the creakie @ shore aflot <eos> whereon the troyan prince spilt turnus blood <eos> and at his feete a bitch wolfe suck did yeeld <eos> to two young babes : his left the palme tree stout <eos> his right hand did the peacefull olive wield <eos> and head with lawrell garnisht was about <eos> sudden both palme and olive fell away <eos> and faire green lawrell branch did quite decay <eos>
the goldfinch , who , to shun the scalding heat <eos> had changed the medlar for a safer seat <eos> and hid in bushes ‘ scaped the bitter shower <eos> now perch 'd upon the lady of the flower <eos> and either songster holding out their throats <eos> and folding up their wings , renew 'd their notes <eos> as if all day , precluding to the fight <eos> they only had rehearsed , to sing by night <eos> the banquet ended , and the battle done <eos> they danced by star light and the friendly moon <eos> and when they were to part , the laureate queen <eos> supplied with steeds the lady of the green <eos> her and her train conducting on the way <eos> the moon to follow , and avoid the day <eos>
look , how the flower which ling'ringly doth fade <eos> the morning 's darling late , the summer 's queen <eos> spoil 'd of that juice which kept it fresh and green <eos> as high as it did raise , bows low the head <eos> right so the pleasures of my life being dead <eos> or in their contraries but only seen <eos> with swifter speed declines than erst it spread <eos> and , blasted , scarce now shows what it hath been <eos> as doth the pilgrim , therefore , whom the night <eos> by darkness would imprison on his way <eos> think on thy home , my soul , and think aright <eos> of what 's yet left thee of life 's wasting day <eos> thy sun posts westward , passed is thy morn <eos> and twice it is not given thee to be born <eos>
still came the multitudes , and still the sea <eos> of human souls surged round the iron base <eos> of that mysterious mountain , while afar <eos> the dim circumference was added to <eos> with newer legions . conquerors of old <eos> armored and visored in resplendent steel <eos> galloped on hell steeds , that with one great bound <eos> cleared bottomless ca ñ ons ; then the kings and queens <eos> of babylon , shorn of their lofty state <eos> came abject , and with terror in those eyes <eos> that once outshone the world ; and after them <eos> myriads who reveled at the feast of life <eos> and when the reeling stupor of their wine <eos> had loosened , woke and found their souls in hell <eos>
had i a man 's fair form , then might my sighs <eos> be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell <eos> thine ear , and find thy gentle heart ; so well <eos> would passion arm me for the enterprize <eos> but ah ! i am no knight whose foeman dies <eos> no cuirass glistens on my bosom 's swell <eos> i am no happy shepherd of the dell <eos> whose lips have trembled with a maiden 's eyes <eos> yet must i dote upon thee ,— call thee sweet <eos> sweeter by far than hybla 's honied roses <eos> when steep 'd in dew rich to intoxication <eos> ah ! i will taste that dew , for me ‘ tis meet <eos> and when the moon her pallid face discloses <eos> i 'll gather some by spells , and incantation <eos>
a vast cathedral by the western sea <eos> whose spires god set in majesty on high <eos> peak after peak of forests to the sky <eos> blended in one vast roof of greenery <eos> the nave , a river broadening to the sea <eos> the aisles , deep canyons of eternal build <eos> the transepts , valleys with god 's splendor filled <eos> the shrines , white waterfalls in leaf laced drapery <eos> the choir stands westward by the sounding shore <eos> the cliffs like beetling pipes set high in air <eos> roll from the beach the thunders crashing there <eos> the high wind voices chord the breakers ’ roar <eos> and wondrous harmonies of praise and prayer <eos> swell to the forest altars evermore <eos>
shall i compare thee to a summer 's day <eos> thou art more lovely and more temperate <eos> rough winds do shake the darling buds of may <eos> and summer 's lease hath all too short a date <eos> sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines <eos> and often is his gold complexion dimmed <eos> and every fair from fair sometime declines <eos> by chance , or nature 's changing course untrimmed <eos> but thy eternal summer shall not fade <eos> nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st <eos> nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade <eos> when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st <eos> so long as men can breathe or eyes can see <eos> so long lives this , and this gives life to thee <eos>
if only in dreams may man be fully blest <eos> is heaven a dream ? is she i clasped a dream <eos> or stood she here even now where dewdrops gleam <eos> and miles of furze shine golden down the west <eos> i seem to clasp her still — still on my breast <eos> her bosom beats ,— i see the blue eyes beam <eos> i think she kissed these lips , for now they seem <eos> scarce mine : so hallowed of the lips they pressed <eos> yon thicket 's breath — can that be eglantine <eos> those birds — can they be morning 's choristers <eos> can this be earth ? can these be banks of furze <eos> like burning bushes fired of god they shine <eos> i seem to know them , though this body of mine <eos> passed into spirit at the touch of hers <eos>
the path runs straight between the flowering rows <eos> a moonlit path , hemmed in by beds of bloom <eos> where phlox and marigolds dispute for room <eos> with tall , red dahlias and the briar rose <eos> ‘ t is reckless prodigality which throws <eos> into the night these wafts of rich perfume <eos> which sweep across the garden like a plume <eos> over the trees a single bright star glows <eos> dear garden of my childhood , here my years <eos> have run away like little grains of sand <eos> the moments of my life , its hopes and fears <eos> have all found utterance here , where now i stand <eos> my eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears <eos> you are my home , do you not understand <eos>
oh ! might these sighs and tears return again <eos> into my breast and eyes which i have spent <eos> that i might , in this holy discontent <eos> mourn with some fruit , as i have mourned in vain <eos> in mine idolatry what showers of rain <eos> mine eyes did waste ! what griefs my heart did rent <eos> that sufferance was my sin i now repent <eos> ‘ cause i did suffer , i must suffer pain <eos> the hydroptic drunkard , and night scouting thief <eos> the itchy lecher , and self tickling proud <eos> have th ’ remembrance of past joys for relief <eos> of coming ills . to poor me is allow 'd <eos> no ease ; for long yet vehement grief hath been <eos> the effect and cause , the punishment and sin <eos>
among the folks , to whom he visits paid <eos> was neighbour peter , one who used the spade <eos> a villager that god , in lieu of lands <eos> had furnished only with a pair of hands <eos> to dig and delve , and by the mattock gain <eos> enough his wife and children to maintain <eos> still youthful charms you in his spouse might trace <eos> the weather injured solely had her face <eos> but not the features which were perfect yet <eos> some wish perhaps more blooming belles to get <eos> the rustick truly me would ne'er have pleased <eos> but such are oft by country parsons seized <eos> who low amours and dishes coarse admire <eos> that palates more refined would not desire <eos>
o lords our gods , it is not that ye sit <eos> serene above the thunder , and exempt <eos> from strife of tongues and casualties that tempt <eos> men merely found by proof of manhood fit <eos> for service of their fellows : this is it <eos> which sets you past the reach of time 's attempt <eos> which gives us right of justified contempt <eos> for commonwealths built up by mere men 's wit <eos> that gold unlocks not , nor may flatteries ope <eos> the portals of your heaven ; that none may hope <eos> with you to watch how life beneath you plods <eos> save for high service given , high duty done <eos> that never was your rank ignobly won <eos> for this we give you praise , o lords our gods <eos>
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes <eos> and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he <eos> remembered in what a haughtier guise <eos> he had flung an alms to leprosie <eos> when he caged his young life up in gilded mail <eos> and set forth in search of the holy grail <eos> the heart within him was ashes and dust <eos> he parted in twain his single crust <eos> he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink <eos> and gave the leper to eat and drink <eos> ‘ twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread <eos> ‘ twas water out of a wooden bowl <eos> yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed <eos> and ‘ twas red wine he drank with his thirsty soul <eos>
whenas my love lay sickly in her bed <eos> pale death did post in hope to have a prey <eos> but she so spotless made him that he fled <eos> “ unmeet to die , ” she cried , and could not stay <eos> back he retired , and thus the heavens he told <eos> “ all things that are , are subject unto me <eos> both towns , and men , and what the world doth hold <eos> but her fair licia still immortal be <eos> the heavens did grant ; a goddess she was made <eos> immortal , fair , unfit to suffer change <eos> so now she lives , and never more shall fade <eos> in earth a goddess , what can be more strange <eos> then will i hope , a goddess and so near <eos> she cannot choose my sighs and prayers but hear <eos>
but gareth spake and all indignantly <eos> ‘ fool , for thou hast , men say , the strength of ten <eos> canst thou not trust the limbs thy god hath given <eos> but must , to make the terror of thee more <eos> trick thyself out in ghastly imageries <eos> of that which life hath done with , and the clod <eos> less dull than thou , will hide with mantling flowers <eos> as if for pity ? ’ but he spake no word <eos> which set the horror higher : a maiden swooned <eos> the lady lyonors wrung her hands and wept <eos> as doomed to be the bride of night and death <eos> sir gareth 's head prickled beneath his helm <eos> and even sir lancelot through his warm blood felt <eos> ice strike , and all that marked him were aghast <eos>
“ not without purpose once more to return <eos> thou find'st me , my casella , where i am <eos> journeying this way ; ” i said , “ but how of thee <eos> hath so much time been lost ? ” he answer 'd straight <eos> “ no outrage hath been done to me , if he <eos> who when and whom he chooses takes , me oft <eos> this passage hath denied , since of just will <eos> his will he makes . these three months past indeed <eos> he , whose chose to enter , with free leave <eos> hath taken ; whence i wand'ring by the shore <eos> where tyber 's wave grows salt , of him gain 'd kind <eos> admittance , at that river 's mouth , tow'rd which <eos> his wings are pointed , for there always throng <eos> all such as not to archeron descend <eos>
long hath my sufferance laboured to enforce <eos> one pearl of pity from her pretty eyes <eos> whilst i with restless rivers of remorse <eos> have bathed the banks where my fair phillis lies <eos> the moaning lines which weeping i have written <eos> and writing read unto my ruthful sheep <eos> and reading sent with tears that never fitten <eos> to my love 's queen , that hath my heart in keep <eos> have made my lambkins lay them down and sigh <eos> but phillis sits , and reads , and calls them trifles <eos> oh heavens , why climb not happy lines so high <eos> to rent that ruthless heart that all hearts rifles <eos> none writes with truer faith , or greater love <eos> yet out , alas ! i have no power to move <eos>
some prouder muse , when comes the hour at last <eos> may shake our hillsides with her bugle blast <eos> not ours the task ; but since the lyric dress <eos> relieves the statelier with its sprightliness <eos> hear an old song , which some , perchance , have seen <eos> in stale gazette or cobwebbed magazine <eos> there was an hour when patriots dared profane <eos> the mast that britain strove to bow in vain <eos> and one , who listened to the tale of shame <eos> whose heart still answered to that sacred name <eos> whose eye still followed o'er his country 's tides <eos> thy glorious flag , our brave old ironsides <eos> from yon lone attic , on a smiling morn <eos> thus mocked the spoilers with his school boy scorn <eos>
hail oklahoma land ! o prairie plain <eos> there is no state more dearly loved .— all hail <eos> where grassy hills and sheltered cove and vale <eos> rest quietly in peace — and in refrain <eos> our voices lift in praise and joy again <eos> we sing of oklahoma land .— all hail <eos> of sunny skies and even windy gale <eos> and wealth of growing corn and flowing grain <eos> where black gold gleams and roses bloom in spring <eos> here long roads stretch and grazing cow herds roam <eos> we build in faith great churches and our state <eos> with many schools , where children gaily sing <eos> we love our loamy fields and prairie home <eos> and struggle onward upward , soon and late <eos>
and thou from heaven 's wrath , and ocean 's waves <eos> that bellowed round the cloud capped mountain tops <eos> the sinful brood didst save ; thou , unto whom <eos> from the dark air and wave encumbered hills <eos> the white dove brought the sign of hope renewed <eos> and sinking in the west , the shipwrecked sun <eos> his bright rays darting through the angry clouds <eos> the dark sky painted with the lovely bow <eos> the race restored , to earth returned , begins anew <eos> the same career of wickedness and lust <eos> with their attendant ills . audacious man <eos> defies the threats of the avenging sea <eos> and to new shores and to new stars repeats <eos> the same sad tale of infamy and woe <eos>
never the heart of spring had trembled so <eos> as on that day when first in paradise <eos> we went afoot as novices to know <eos> for the first time what blue was in the skies <eos> what fresher green than any in the grass <eos> and how the sap goes beating to the sun <eos> and tell how on the clocks of beauty pass <eos> minute by minute till the last is done <eos> but not the new birds singing in the brake <eos> and not the buds of our discovery <eos> the deeper blue , the wilder green , the ache <eos> for beauty that we shadow as we see <eos> made heaven , but we , as love 's occasion brings <eos> took these , and made them paradisal things <eos>
in the old age black was not counted fair <eos> or if it were it bore not beauty 's name <eos> but now is black beauty 's successive heir <eos> and beauty slandered with a bastard shame <eos> for since each hand hath put on nature 's power <eos> fairing the foul with art 's false borrowed face <eos> sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower <eos> but is profaned , if not lives in disgrace <eos> therefore my mistress ’ eyes are raven black <eos> her eyes so suited , and they mourners seem <eos> at such who not born fair no beauty lack <eos> slandering creation with a false esteem <eos> yet so they mourn becoming of their woe <eos> that every tongue says beauty should look so <eos>
two days had passed , when came a youthful friend <eos> fair nancy with her often would unbend <eos> howe'er , so very thoughtful alice seemed <eos> that nancy ( who was penetrating deemed <eos> was well convinced whatever alice sought <eos> so very absent she was not for naught <eos> in questioning she managed with such art <eos> that soon she learned — what alice could impart <eos> to listen she was thoroughly disposed <eos> while t'other ev'ry circumstance disclosed <eos> from first to last , each point and mystick hit <eos> and e'en the largeness of the friar 's wit <eos> the repetitions , and the wondrous skill <eos> with which he managed ev'ry thing at will <eos>
one time i wooed a maid ( dear is she yet <eos> all in the revel eye of young love 's moon <eos> content she made me ,— ah , my dimpling mate <eos> my springtime girl , who walked with flower shoon <eos> but near me , nearer , steals a deep eyed maid <eos> with creeping glance that sees and will not see <eos> and blush that would those yea sweet eyes upbraid <eos> o , might i woo her nor inconstant be <eos> but is not autumn dreamtime of the spring <eos> ( yon scarlet fruit bell is a flower asleep <eos> and i am not forsworn if yet i keep <eos> dream faith with spring in autumn 's deeper kiss <eos> then so , brown maiden , take this true love ring <eos> and lay thy long , soft locks where my heart is <eos>
not so with thee ; for some indeed there are <eos> who would behold the truth and then return <eos> to pine among the semblances — but i <eos> divined in thee the questing foot that never <eos> revisits the cold hearth of yesterday <eos> or calls achievement home . i from afar <eos> beheld thee fashioned for one hour 's high use <eos> nor meant to slake oblivion drop by drop <eos> long , long hadst thou inhabited my dreams <eos> surprising me as harts surprise a pool <eos> stealing to drink at midnight ; i divined <eos> thee rash to reach the heart of life , and lie <eos> bosom to bosom in occasion 's arms <eos> and said : because i love thee thou shalt die <eos>
‘ man is of soul and body , formed for deeds <eos> of high resolve , on fancy 's boldest wing <eos> to soar unwearied , fearlessly to turn <eos> the keenest pangs to peacefulness , and taste <eos> the joys which mingled sense and spirit yield <eos> or he is formed for abjectness and woe <eos> to grovel on the dunghill of his fears <eos> to shrink at every sound , to quench the flame <eos> of natural love in sensualism , to know <eos> that hour as blessed when on his worthless days <eos> the frozen hand of death shall set its seal <eos> yet fear the cure , though hating the disease <eos> the one is man that shall hereafter be <eos> the other , man as vice has made him now <eos>
o wild west wind , thou breath of autumn 's being <eos> thou , from whose unseen presence the leaves dead <eos> are driven , like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing <eos> yellow , and black , and pale , and hectic red <eos> pestilence stricken multitudes : o thou <eos> who chariotest to their dark wintry bed <eos> the wing é d seeds , where they lie cold and low <eos> each like a corpse within its grave , until <eos> thine azure sister of the spring shall blow <eos> her clarion o'er the dreaming earth , and fill <eos> ( driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air <eos> with living hues and odours plain and hill <eos> wild spirit , which art moving everywhere <eos> destroyer and preserver ; hear , o hear <eos>
the stately beast the two tyrrhidae bred <eos> snatch 'd from his dams , and the tame youngling fed <eos> their father tyrrheus did his fodder bring <eos> tyrrheus , chief ranger to the latian king <eos> their sister silvia cherish 'd with her care <eos> the little wanton , and did wreaths prepare <eos> to hang his budding horns , with ribbons tied <eos> his tender neck , and comb 'd his silken hide <eos> and bathed his body . patient of command <eos> in time he grew , and , growing us 'd to hand <eos> he waited at his master 's board for food <eos> then sought his salvage kindred in the wood <eos> where grazing all the day , at night he came <eos> to his known lodgings , and his country dame <eos>

lift up your eyes ! behold these pictured walls <eos> look where the flood of western glory falls <eos> through the great sunflower disk of blazing panes <eos> in ruby , saffron , azure , emerald stains <eos> with reverent step the marble pavement tread <eos> where our proud mother 's martyr roll is read <eos> see the great halls that cluster , gathering round <eos> this lofty shrine with holiest memories crowned <eos> see the fair matron in her summer bower <eos> fresh as a rose in bright perennial flower <eos> read on her standard , always in the van <eos> “ truth , ” — the one word that makes a slave a man <eos> think whose the hands that fed her altar fires <eos> then count the debt we owe our scholar sires <eos>
care charmer sleep , son of the sable night <eos> brother to death , in silent darkness born <eos> relieve my languish , and restore the light <eos> with dark forgetting of my care return <eos> and let the day be time enough to mourn <eos> the shipwreck of my ill adventured youth <eos> let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn <eos> without the torment of the night 's untruth <eos> cease , dreams , the images of day desires <eos> to model forth the passions of the morrow <eos> never let rising sun approve you liars <eos> to add more grief to aggravate my sorrow <eos> still let me sleep , embracing clouds in vain <eos> and never wake to feel the day 's disdain <eos>
death , what hast thou to do with one for whom <eos> time is not lord , but servant ? what least part <eos> of all the fire that fed his living heart <eos> of all the light more keen than sundawn 's bloom <eos> that lit and led his spirit , strong as doom <eos> and bright as hope , can aught thy breath may dart <eos> quench ? nay , thou knowest he knew thee what thou art <eos> a shadow born of terror 's barren womb <eos> that brings not forth save shadows . what art thou <eos> to dream , albeit thou breathe upon his brow <eos> that power on him is given thee ,— that thy breath <eos> can make him less than love acclaims him now <eos> and hears all time sound back the word it saith <eos> what part hast thou then in his glory , death <eos>
a wall , a wall around my garden rear <eos> and hedge me in from the disconsolate hills <eos> give me but one of all the mountain rills <eos> enough of ocean in its voice i hear <eos> come no profane insatiate mortal near <eos> with the contagion of his passionate ills <eos> the smoke of battle all the valley fills <eos> let the eternal sunlight greet me here <eos> this spot is sacred to the deeper soul <eos> and to the piety that mocks no more <eos> in nature 's inmost heart is no uproar <eos> none in this shrine ; in peace the heavens roll <eos> in peace the slow tides pulse from shore to shore <eos> and ancient quiet broods from pole to pole <eos>
there is a booming in the forest boughs <eos> tremendous feet seem trampling through the trees <eos> the storm is at his wildman revelries <eos> and earth and heaven echo his carouse <eos> night reels with tumult ; and , from out her house <eos> of cloud , the moon looks ,— like a face one sees <eos> in nightmare ,— hurrying , with pale eyes that freeze <eos> stooping above with white , malignant brows <eos> the isolated oak upon the hill <eos> that seemed , at sunset , in terrific lands <eos> a titan head black in a sea of blood <eos> now seems a monster harp , whose wild strings thrill <eos> to the vast fingering of innumerable hands <eos> spirits of tempest and of solitude <eos>
all curses be about her , and all ill <eos> go with her ; heaven be dark above her way <eos> the gulf beneath her glad and sure of prey <eos> and , wheresoe'er her prow be pointed , still <eos> the winds of heaven have all one evil will <eos> conspirant even as hearts of kings to slay <eos> with mouths of kings to lie and smile and pray <eos> and chiefliest his whose wintrier breath makes chill <eos> with more than winter 's and more poisonous cold <eos> the horror of his kingdom toward the north <eos> the deserts of his kingdom toward the east <eos> and though death hide not in her direful hold <eos> be all stars adverse toward her that come forth <eos> nightly , by day all hours till all have ceased <eos>
pregnant with possibilities of crime <eos> and full of felons for all coming time <eos> your blood 's too precious to be lightly spilt <eos> in testimony to a venial guilt <eos> live to get whelpage and preserve a name <eos> no praise can sweeten and no lie unshame <eos> live to fulfill the vision that i see <eos> down the dim vistas of the time to be <eos> a dream of clattering beaks and burning eyes <eos> of hungry ravens glooming all the skies <eos> a dream of gleaming teeth and foetid breath <eos> of jackals wrangling at the feast of death <eos> a dream of broken necks and swollen tongues <eos> the whole world 's gibbets loaded with de youngs <eos>
there 's not a budding boy or girl , this day <eos> but is got up , and gone to bring in may <eos> a deal of youth , ere this , is come <eos> back , and with white thorn laden home <eos> some have despatched their cakes and cream <eos> before that we have left to dream <eos> and some have wept , and wooed and plighted troth <eos> and chose their priest , ere we can cast off sloth <eos> many a green gown has been given <eos> many a kiss , both odd and even <eos> many a glance , too , has been sent <eos> from out the eye , love 's firmament <eos> many a jest told of the keys betraying <eos> this night , and locks picked , yet we 're not a maying <eos>
white , glittering sunlight fills the market square <eos> spotted and sprigged with shadows . double rows <eos> of bartering booths spread out their tempting shows <eos> of globed and golden fruit , the morning air <eos> smells sweet with ripeness , on the pavement there <eos> a wicker basket gapes and overflows <eos> spilling out cool , blue plums . the market glows <eos> and flaunts , and clatters in its busy care <eos> a stately minster at the northern side <eos> lifts its twin spires to the distant sky <eos> pinnacled , carved and buttressed ; through the wide <eos> arched doorway peals an organ , suddenly <eos> crashing , triumphant in its pregnant tide <eos> quenching the square in vibrant harmony <eos>
“ oh ! adrian , my faint heart fain would dwell <eos> forever here beneath thy love 's dear spell <eos> but ah ! beyond the height where breaks the day <eos> there lives a charm that calls my soul away <eos> afar the mountains glow in pale , blue mist <eos> by fleecy clouds and summer sunshine kissed <eos> and see ! beyond them all i long to be <eos> beyond this shore , beyond the trackless sea <eos> ah ! this is why , dear adrian , we must part <eos> although it rends my grieving , restless heart <eos> forgive me if to night i 've caused thee pain <eos> if grief be thine , forgive me once again <eos> farewell ! when from thy life my love is fled <eos> henceforth to thee let hilda 's name be dead <eos>

with clytia he no longer was received <eos> than while he was a man of wealth believed <eos> balls , concerts , op'ras , tournaments , and plays <eos> expensive dresses , all engaging ways <eos> were used to captivate this lady fair <eos> while scarcely one around but in despair <eos> wife , widow , maid , his fond affection sought <eos> to gain him , ev'ry wily art was brought <eos> but all in vain :— by passion overpow'red <eos> the belle , whose conduct others would have soured <eos> to him appeared a goddess full of charms <eos> superior e'en to helen , in his arms <eos> from whence we may conclude , the beauteous dame <eos> was always deaf to fred'rick ' s ardent flame <eos>

could i but picture her — ah , you would deem <eos> my tale the figment of a poet 's dream <eos> and if you saw her , ( could such bliss be given <eos> you'ld think yourself in dreamland — or in heaven <eos> not the red rapture of new wakened roses <eos> when morning dew their soul of love uncloses <eos> ( roses that must be wooed ,— nor may be won <eos> save by the prince of lovers , the warm sun <eos> not the fair lily , nor the violet shy <eos> whose heart 's love lurks deep in her still blue eye <eos> nor any flower , the loveliest and the best <eos> can image to you half the charm compressed <eos> in those dear eyes , those lips ,— nay , every part <eos> that made that sum of witcheries — elfinhart <eos>
when i have borne in memory what has tamed <eos> great nations , how ennobling thoughts depart <eos> when men change swords for ledgers , and desert <eos> the student 's bower for gold , some fears unnamed <eos> i had , my country ! am i to be blamed <eos> but , when i think of thee , and what thou art <eos> verily , in the bottom of my heart <eos> of those unfilial fears i am ashamed <eos> but dearly must we prize thee ; we who find <eos> in thee a bulwark of the cause of men <eos> and i by my affection was beguiled <eos> what wonder , if a poet , now and then <eos> among the many movements of his mind <eos> felt for thee as a lover or a child <eos>
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem <eos> by that sweet ornament which truth doth give <eos> the rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem <eos> for that sweet odour , which doth in it live <eos> the canker blooms have full as deep a dye <eos> as the perfumed tincture of the roses <eos> hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly <eos> when summer 's breath their masked buds discloses <eos> but for their virtue only is their show <eos> they live unwooed , and unrespected fade <eos> die to themselves . sweet roses do not so <eos> of their sweet deaths , are sweetest odours made <eos> and so of you , beauteous and lovely youth <eos> when that shall vade , by verse distills your truth <eos>
god who can bind the stars eternally <eos> with but a breath of spirit speech , a thought <eos> who can within earth 's arms lay the mad sea <eos> unseverably , and count it as sheer naught <eos> with his all might could bind not you and me <eos> for tho he pressed us heart to burning heart <eos> and set then to the passion that enthralls <eos> his sanction , still our souls stood e'er apart <eos> as aliens beating fierce against the walls <eos> of dark unsympathy that would upstart <eos> stood aliens , aye ! and would tho we should meet <eos> beyond the oblivion of unnumbered births <eos> upon some world where time cannot repeat <eos> the feeblest syllable that once was earth 's <eos>

if , when we meet , i 'm cropped in awkward style <eos> by some uneven barber , then you smile <eos> you smile , if , as it haps , my gown 's askew <eos> if my shirt 's ragged while my tunic 's new <eos> how , if my mind 's inconsequent , rejects <eos> what late it longed for , what it loathed affects <eos> shifts every moment , with itself at strife <eos> and makes a chaos of an ordered life <eos> builds castles up , then pulls them to the ground <eos> keeps changing round for square and square for round <eos> you smile not ; ‘ tis an every day affair <eos> i need no doctor 's , no , nor keeper 's care <eos> yet you 're my patron , and would blush to fail <eos> in taking notice of an ill pared nail <eos>
i saw a river swift , whose fomy billowes <eos> did wash the ground work of an old great wall <eos> i saw it cover 'd all with griesly shadowes <eos> that with black horror did the ayre appall <eos> thereout a strange beast with seven heads arose <eos> that townes and castles under her brest did coure <eos> and seem 'd both milder beasts and fiercer foes <eos> alike with equall ravine to devoure <eos> much was i mazde to see this monsters kinde <eos> in hundred formes to change his fearefull hew <eos> when as at length i saw the wrathfull winde <eos> which blows cold storms , burst out of scithian mew <eos> that sperst these cloudes ; and , in so short as thought <eos> this dreadfull shape was vanished to nought <eos>
o sugared talk , wherewith my thoughts do live <eos> o brows , love 's trophy and my senses ’ shine <eos> o charming smiles , that death or life can give <eos> o heavenly kisses from a mouth divine <eos> o wreaths too strong , and trammels made of hair <eos> o pearls inclos è d in an ebon pale <eos> o rose and lilies in a field most fair <eos> where modest white doth make the red seem pale <eos> o voice whose accents live within my heart <eos> o heavenly hand that more than atlas holds <eos> o sighs perfumed , that can release my smart <eos> o happy they whom in her arms she folds <eos> now if you ask where dwelleth all this bliss <eos> seek out my love and she will tell you this <eos>
what human form is this ? what form divine <eos> and who are these that gaze upon his face <eos> mild , beautiful , and full of heavenly grace <eos> with whose reflected light the gazers shine <eos> saviour , who does not know it to be thine <eos> who does not long to fill a gazer 's place <eos> and yet there is no time , there is no space <eos> to keep away thy servants from thy shrine <eos> here if we kneel , and watch with faithful eyes <eos> thou art not too far for faithful eyes to see <eos> thou art not too far to turn and look on me <eos> to speak to me , and to receive my sighs <eos> therefore for ever i forget the skies <eos> and find an everlasting sun in thee <eos>
children of later growth , we love the play <eos> we love its heroes , be they grave or gay <eos> from squeaking , peppery , devil defying punch <eos> to roaring richard with his camel hunch <eos> adore its heroines , those immortal dames <eos> time 's only rivals , whom he never tames <eos> whose youth , unchanging , lives while thrones decay <eos> ( age spares the pyramids and dejazet <eos> the saucy aproned , razor tongued soubrette <eos> the blond haired beauty with the eyes of jet <eos> the gorgeous beings whom the viewless wires <eos> lift to the skies in strontian crimsoned fires <eos> and all the wealth of splendor that awaits <eos> the throng that enters those elysian gates <eos>
i lift my heavy heart up solemnly <eos> as once electra her sepulchral urn <eos> and , looking in thine eyes , i over turn <eos> the ashes at thy feet . behold and see <eos> what a great heap of grief lay hid in me <eos> and how the red wild sparkles dimly burn <eos> through the ashen greyness . if thy foot in scorn <eos> could tread them out to darkness utterly <eos> it might be well perhaps . but if instead <eos> thou wait beside me for the wind to blow <eos> the grey dust up , . . . those laurels on thine head <eos> o my beloved , will not shield thee so <eos> that none of all the fires shall scorch and shred <eos> the hair beneath . stand further off then ! go <eos>

“ curse thee , life , i will live with thee no more <eos> thou hast mocked me , starved me , beat my body sore <eos> and all for a pledge that was not pledged by me <eos> i have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly <eos> that i might eat again , and met thy sneers <eos> with deprecations , and thy blows with tears <eos> aye , from thy glutted lash , glad , crawled away <eos> as if spent passion were a holiday <eos> and now i go . nor threat , nor easy vow <eos> of tardy kindness can avail thee now <eos> with me , whence fear and faith alike are flown <eos> lonely i came , and i depart alone <eos> and know not where nor unto whom i go <eos> but that thou canst not follow me i know <eos>
this is my play 's last scene ; here heavens appoint <eos> my pilgrimage 's last mile ; and my race <eos> idly yet quickly run , hath this last pace <eos> my span 's last inch , my minute 's latest point <eos> and gluttonous death will instantly unjoint <eos> my body and soul , and i shall sleep a space <eos> but my ever waking part shall see that face <eos> whose fear already shakes my every joint <eos> then as my soul to heaven , her first seat , takes flight <eos> and earth born body in the earth shall dwell <eos> so fall my sins , that all may have their right <eos> to where they 're bred , and would press me to hell <eos> impute me righteous ; thus purged of evil <eos> for thus i leave the world , the flesh , the devil <eos>
the castle gate stands open now <eos> and the wanderer is welcome to the hall <eos> as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough <eos> no longer scowl the turrets tall <eos> the summer 's long siege at last is o'er <eos> when the first poor outcast went in at the door <eos> she entered with him in disguise <eos> and mastered the fortress by surprise <eos> there is no spot she loves so well on ground <eos> she lingers and smiles there the whole year round <eos> the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land <eos> has hall and bower at his command <eos> and there 's no poor man in the north countree <eos> but is lord of the earldom as much as he <eos>
see the sole bliss heaven could on all bestow <eos> which who but feels can taste , but thinks can know <eos> yet poor with fortune , and with learning blind <eos> the bad must miss ; the good , untaught , will find <eos> slave to no sect , who takes no private road <eos> but looks through nature up to nature 's god <eos> pursues that chain which links th ’ immense design <eos> joins heaven and earth , and mortal and divine <eos> sees , that no being any bliss can know <eos> but touches some above , and some below <eos> learns , from this union of the rising whole <eos> the first , last purpose of the human soul <eos> and knows where faith , law , morals , all began <eos> all end , in love of god , and love of man <eos>
fair matchless nymph , respect but what i crave <eos> my thoughts are true , and honour is my love <eos> i fainting die whom yet a smile might save <eos> you gave the wound , and can the hurt remove <eos> those eyes like stars that twinkle in the night <eos> and cheeks like rubies pale in lilies dyed <eos> those ebon hands that darting hath such might <eos> that in my soul my love and life divide <eos> accept the passions of a man possessed <eos> let love be loved and grant me leave to live <eos> disperse those clouds that darkened have my rest <eos> and let your heaven a sun like smile but give <eos> then shall i praise that heaven for such a sun <eos> that saved my life , whenas my grief begun <eos>
order is heaven 's first law : and , this confest <eos> some are and must be greater than the rest <eos> more rich , more wise ; but who infers from hence <eos> that such are happier , shocks all common sense <eos> heaven to mankind impartial we confess <eos> if all are equal in their happiness <eos> but mutual wants this happiness increase <eos> all nature 's difference keeps all nature 's peace <eos> condition , circumstance , is not the thing <eos> bliss is the same in subject or in king <eos> in who obtain defence or who defend <eos> in him who is or him who finds a friend <eos> heaven breathes through every member of the whole <eos> one common blessing , as one common soul <eos>
one spring brought me my wedding day <eos> brought me my bright eyed jeanne amray <eos> brought that night to our cabin door <eos> my old , lost comrade , nell latore <eos> her eyes swam fire , and her cheek was red <eos> her full breast heaved as she darkly said <eos> “ the coyote hides from the wind and rain <eos> the wild horse flies from the hurricane <eos> but who can flee from the half breed 's hate <eos> that rises soon and that watches late <eos> then went ; and i laughed jeanne 's fears afar <eos> but i thought that wench was our evil star <eos> be sure , when a woman 's heart gets hard <eos> it works up war like a navy yard <eos>
fair is my love , and cruel as she 's fair <eos> her brow shades frown , although her eyes are sunny <eos> her smiles are lightning , though her pride despair <eos> and her disdains are gall , her favours honey <eos> a modest maid , deck 'd with a blush of honour <eos> whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love <eos> the wonder of all eyes that look upon her <eos> sacred on earth ; design 'd a saint above <eos> chastity and beauty , which are deadly foes <eos> live reconciled friends within her brow <eos> and had she pity to conjoin with those <eos> then who had heard the plaints i utter now <eos> for had she not been fair , and thus unkind <eos> my muse had slept , and none had known my mind <eos>
lord , if i love thee and thou lovest me <eos> why need i any more these toilsome days <eos> why should i not run singing up thy ways <eos> straight into heaven , to rest myself with thee <eos> what need remains of death pang yet to be <eos> if all my soul is quickened in thy praise <eos> if all my heart loves thee , what need the amaze <eos> struggle and dimness of an agony <eos> bride whom i love , if thou too lovest me <eos> thou needs must choose my likeness for thy dower <eos> so wilt thou toil in patience , and abide <eos> hungering and thirsting for that blessed hour <eos> when i my likeness shall behold in thee <eos> and thou therein shalt waken satisfied <eos>
the last and greatest herald of heaven 's king <eos> girt with rough skins , hies to the deserts wild <eos> among that savage brood the woods forth bring <eos> which he more harmless found than man , and mild <eos> his food was locusts , and what there doth spring <eos> with honey that from virgin hives distill 'd <eos> parch 'd body , hollow eyes , some uncouth thing <eos> made him appear , long since from earth exiled <eos> there burst he forth ; ‘ all ye whose hopes rely <eos> on god , with me amidst these deserts mourn <eos> repent , repent , and from old errors turn <eos> who listen 'd to his voice , obey 'd his cry <eos> only the echoes , which he made relent <eos> rung from their flinty caves , ‘ repent , repent <eos>

milton ! thou should'st be living at this hour <eos> england hath need of thee : she is a fen <eos> of stagnant waters : altar , sword and pen <eos> fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower <eos> have forfeited their ancient english dower <eos> of inward happiness . we are selfish men <eos> oh ! raise us up , return to us again <eos> and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power <eos> thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart <eos> thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea <eos> pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free <eos> so didst thou travel on life 's common way <eos> in chearful godliness ; and yet thy heart <eos> the lowliest duties on itself did lay <eos>

one day i sought with her hart thrilling eies <eos> to make a truce , and termes to entertaine <eos> all fearlesse then of so false enimies <eos> which sought me to entrap in treasons traine <eos> so , as i then disarmed did remaine <eos> a wicked ambush , which lay hidden long <eos> in the close covert of her guilful eyen <eos> thence breaking forth , did thick about me throng <eos> too feeble i t'abide the brunt so strong <eos> was forst to yield my selfe into their hands <eos> who , me captiving streight with rigorous wrong <eos> have ever since kept me in cruell bands <eos> so , ladie , now to you i doo complaine <eos> against your eies , that iustice i may gaine <eos>
inland , within a hollow vale , i stood <eos> and saw , while sea was calm and air was clear <eos> the coast of france — the coast of france how near <eos> drawn almost into frightful neighbourhood <eos> i shrunk ; for verily the barrier flood <eos> was like a lake , or river bright and fair <eos> a span of waters ; yet what power is there <eos> what mightiness for evil and for good ! [ b <eos> even so doth god protect us if we be <eos> virtuous and wise . winds blow , and waters roll <eos> strength to the brave , and power , and deity <eos> yet in themselves are nothing ! one decree <eos> spake laws to them , and said that by the soul <eos> only , the nations shall be great and free <eos>
then was the faire dodonian tree far seene <eos> upon seaven hills to spread his gladsome gleame <eos> and conquerours bedecked with his greene <eos> along the bancks of the ausonian streame <eos> there many an auncient trophee was addrest <eos> and many a spoyle , and many a goodly show <eos> which that brave races greatnes did attest <eos> that whilome from the troyan blood did flow <eos> ravisht i was so rare a thing to vew <eos> when lo ! a barbarous troupe of clownish fone <eos> the honour of these noble boughs down threw <eos> under the wedge i heard the tronck to grone <eos> and since , i saw the roote in great disdaine <eos> a twinne of forked trees send forth againe <eos>
not from without us , only from within <eos> comes or can ever come upon us light <eos> whereby the soul keeps ever truth in sight <eos> no truth , no strength , no comfort man may win <eos> no grace for guidance , no release from sin <eos> save of his own soul 's giving . deep and bright <eos> as fire enkindled in the core of night <eos> burns in the soul where once its fire has been <eos> the light that leads and quickens thought , inspired <eos> to doubt and trust and conquer . so he said <eos> whom sidney , flower of england , lordliest head <eos> of all we love , loved : but the fates required <eos> a sacrifice to hate and hell , ere fame <eos> should set with his in heaven giordano 's name <eos>
seductive waltz !— though on thy native shore <eos> even werter 's self proclaim 'd thee half a whore <eos> werter — to decent vice though much inclined <eos> yet warm , not wanton ; dazzled , but not blind <eos> though gentle genlis , in her strife with sta ë l <eos> would even proscribe thee from a paris ball <eos> the fashion hails — from countesses to queens <eos> and maids and valets waltz behind the scenes <eos> wide and more wide thy witching circle spreads <eos> and turns — if nothing else — at least our heads <eos> with thee even clumsy cits attempt to bounce <eos> and cockneys practise what they can n't pronounce <eos> gods ! how the glorious theme my strain exalts <eos> and rhyme finds partner rhyme in praise of “ waltz <eos>

but , ah ! ye maids , beware the gipsy 's lures <eos> she opens not the womb of time , but yours <eos> oft has her hands the hapless marian wrung <eos> marian , whom gay in sweetest strains has sung <eos> the parson 's maid — sore cause had she to rue <eos> the gipsy 's tongue ; the parson 's daughter too <eos> long had that anxious daughter sighed to know <eos> what vellum 's sprucy clerk , the valley 's beau <eos> meant by those glances which at church he stole <eos> her father nodding to the psalm 's slow drawl <eos> long had she sighed ; at length a prophet came <eos> by many a sure prediction known to fame <eos> to marian known , and all she told , for true <eos> she knew the future , for the past she knew <eos>
when old jack died , it seemed to us , some way <eos> that all the other dogs in town were pained <eos> with our bereavement , and some that were chained <eos> even , unslipped their collars on that day <eos> to visit jack in state , as though to pay <eos> a last , sad tribute there , while neighbors craned <eos> their heads above the high board fence , and deigned <eos> to sigh “ poor dog ! ” remembering how they <eos> had cuffed him , when alive , perchance , because <eos> for love of them he leaped to lick their hands <eos> now , that he could not , were they satisfied <eos> we children thought that , as we crossed his paws <eos> and o'er his grave , ‘ way down the bottom lands <eos> wrote “ our first love lies here , ” when old jack died <eos>

sin of self love possesseth all mine eye <eos> and all my soul , and all my every part <eos> and for this sin there is no remedy <eos> it is so grounded inward in my heart <eos> methinks no face so gracious is as mine <eos> no shape so true , no truth of such account <eos> and for my self mine own worth do define <eos> as i all other in all worths surmount <eos> but when my glass shows me my self indeed <eos> beated and chopt with tanned antiquity <eos> mine own self love quite contrary i read <eos> self , so self loving were iniquity <eos> ‘ tis thee ( my self ) that for my self i praise <eos> painting my age with beauty of thy days <eos>

there was never a sound beside the wood but one <eos> and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground <eos> what was it it whispered ? i knew not well myself <eos> perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun <eos> something , perhaps , about the lack of sound <eos> and that was why it whispered and did not speak <eos> it was no dream of the gift of idle hours <eos> or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf <eos> anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak <eos> to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows <eos> not without feeble pointed spikes of flowers <eos> ( pale orchises ) , and scared a bright green snake <eos> the fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows <eos> my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make <eos>

earth has not anything to show more fair <eos> dull would be he of soul who could pass by <eos> a sight so touching in its majesty <eos> this city now doth , like a garment , wear <eos> the beauty of the morning ; silent , bare <eos> ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples lie <eos> open unto the fields , and to the sky <eos> all bright and glittering in the smokeless air <eos> never did sun more beautifully steep <eos> in his first splendour , valley , rock , or hill <eos> ne'er saw i , never felt , a calm so deep <eos> the river glideth at his own sweet will <eos> dear god ! the very houses seem asleep <eos> and all that mighty heart is lying still <eos>
i speak , fair licia , what my torments be <eos> but then my speech too partial do i find <eos> for hardly words can with those thoughts agree <eos> those thoughts that swarm in such a troubled mind <eos> then do i vow my tongue shall never speak <eos> nor tell my grief that in my heart doth lie <eos> but cannon like , i then surcharged do break <eos> and so my silence worse than speech i try <eos> thus speech or none , they both do breed my care <eos> i live dismayed , and kill my heart with grief <eos> in all respects my case alike doth fare <eos> to him that wants , and dare not ask relief <eos> then you , fair lucia , sovereign of my heart <eos> read to yourself my anguish and my smart <eos>

that day , to great achilles son resign 'd <eos> hermione , the fairest of her kind <eos> was sent to crown the long protracted joy <eos> espoused before the final doom of troy <eos> with steeds and gilded cars , a gorgeous train <eos> attend the nymphs to phthia 's distant reign <eos> meanwhile at home , to megapentha 's bed <eos> the virgin choir alector 's daughter led <eos> brave megapenthas from a stolen amour <eos> to great atrides ’ age his handmaid bore <eos> to helen 's bed the gods alone assign <eos> hermione , to extend the regal line <eos> on whom a radiant pomp oh graces wait <eos> resembling venus in attractive state <eos>
italia ! thou art fallen , though with sheen <eos> of battle spears thy clamorous armies stride <eos> from the north alps to the sicilian tide <eos> ay ! fallen , though the nations hail thee queen <eos> because rich gold in every town is seen <eos> and on thy sapphire lake in tossing pride <eos> of wind filled vans thy myriad galleys ride <eos> beneath one flag of red and white and green <eos> o fair and strong ! o strong and fair in vain <eos> look southward where rome 's desecrated town <eos> lies mourning for her god anointed king <eos> look heaven ward ! shall god allow this thing <eos> nay ! but some flame girt raphael shall come down <eos> and smite the spoiler with the sword of pain <eos>
i see gray teachers ,— on their work intent <eos> their lavished lives , in endless labor spent <eos> had closed at last in age and penury wrecked <eos> martyrs , not burned , but frozen in neglect <eos> save for the generous hands that stretched in aid <eos> of worn out servants left to die half paid <eos> ah , many a year will pass , i thought , ere we <eos> such kindly forethought shall rejoice to see <eos> monarchs are mindful of the sacred debt <eos> that cold republics hasten to forget <eos> i see the priest ,— if such a name he bears <eos> who without pride his sacred vestment wears <eos> and while the symbols of his tribe i seek <eos> thus my first impulse bids me think and speak <eos>
the sex inclined to follow this advice <eos> about receipts however they were not nice <eos> the entertainment greatly was admired <eos> and pure devotion all their bosoms fired <eos> a glass of cordial some apart received <eos> good cheer was given , may be well believed <eos> ten youthful dames brisk friar fripart took <eos> gay , airy , and engaging ev'ry look <eos> who paid with pleasure all the monk could wish <eos> some had fifteen :— some twelve to taste their dish <eos> good friar rock had twenty for his share <eos> and gave such satisfaction to the fair <eos> that some , to show they never grudged the price <eos> and proved their punctuality ,— paid twice <eos>
how soon hath time , the subtle thief of youth <eos> stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year <eos> my hasting days fly on with full career <eos> but my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th <eos> perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth <eos> that i to manhood am arrived so near <eos> and inward ripeness doth much less appear <eos> that some more timely happy spirits endu'th <eos> yet , be it less or more , or soon or slow <eos> it shall be still in strictest measure even <eos> to that same lot , however mean or high <eos> toward which time leads me , and the will of heaven <eos> all is , if i have grace to use it so <eos> as ever in my great task master 's eye <eos>
our love is not a fading , earthly flower <eos> its wing è d seed dropped down from paradise <eos> and , nursed by day and night , by sun and shower <eos> doth momently to fresher beauty rise <eos> to us the leafless autumn is not bare <eos> nor winter 's rattling boughs lack lusty green <eos> our summer hearts make summer 's fulness , where <eos> no leaf , or bud , or blossom may be seen <eos> for nature 's life in love 's deep life doth lie <eos> love ,— whose forgetfulness is beauty 's death <eos> whose mystic key these cells of thou and i <eos> into the infinite freedom openeth <eos> and makes the body 's dark and narrow grate <eos> the wide flung leaves of heaven 's own palace gate <eos>
one of my wishes is that those dark trees <eos> so old and firm they scarcely show the breeze <eos> were not , as ‘ twere , the merest mask of gloom <eos> but stretched away unto the edge of doom <eos> i should not be withheld but that some day <eos> into their vastness i should steal away <eos> fearless of ever finding open land <eos> or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand <eos> i do not see why i should e'er turn back <eos> or those should not set forth upon my track <eos> to overtake me , who should miss me here <eos> and long to know if still i held them dear <eos> they would not find me changed from him they knew <eos> only more sure of all i thought was true <eos>

howbeit i know not whether as he slept <eos> a voice from out the depth of dream upleapt <eos> and whispered in his ear ; or whether he <eos> grew to the knowledge blindly , as a tree <eos> waxes from bloom to fruitage , knowing not <eos> the manner of its growth : but this i wot <eos> that rising from that sleep beside the spring <eos> the prince had knowledge of a certain thing <eos> whereof he had not wist until that hour <eos> to wit , that two contending spirits had power <eos> over his spirit , ruling him with sway <eos> altern ; as ‘ twere dominion now of day <eos> and now of dark ; for one was of the light <eos> and one was of the blackness of the night <eos>
from the beginning good and fair are one <eos> but men the beauty from the truth will part <eos> and , though the truth is ever beauty 's heart <eos> after the beauty will , short breathed , run <eos> and the indwelling truth deny and shun <eos> therefore , in cottage , synagogue , and mart <eos> thy thoughts came forth in common speech , not art <eos> with voice and eye , in jewish babylon <eos> thou taughtest — not with pen or carved stone <eos> nor in thy hand the trembling wires didst take <eos> thou of the truth not less than all wouldst make <eos> for truth 's sake even her forms thou didst disown <eos> ere , through the love of beauty , truth shall fail <eos> the light behind shall burn the broidered veil <eos>
“ thus when young hercules with firm disdain <eos> braved the soft smiles of pleasure 's harlot train <eos> to valiant toils his forceful limbs assign 'd <eos> and gave to virtue all his mighty mind <eos> 495 fierce achelous rush 'd from mountain caves <eos> o'er sad etolia pour 'd his wasteful waves <eos> o'er lowing vales and bleating pastures roll 'd <eos> swept her red vineyards , and her glebes of gold <eos> mined all her towns , uptore her rooted woods <eos> 500 and famine danced upon the shining floods <eos> the youthful hero seized his curled crest <eos> and dash 'd with lifted club the watery pest <eos> with waving arm the billowy tumult quell 'd <eos> and to his course the bellowing fiend repell 'd <eos>
gone are the sensuous stars , and manifold <eos> clear sunbeams burst upon the front of night <eos> ten thousand swords of azure and of gold <eos> give darkness to the dark and welcome light <eos> across the night of ages strike the gleams <eos> and leading on the gilded host appears <eos> an old man writing in a book of dreams <eos> and telling tales of lovers for the years <eos> still troilus hears a voice that whispers , stay <eos> in nature 's garden what a mad rout sings <eos> let 's hear these motley pilgrims wile away <eos> the tedious hours with stories of old things <eos> or might some shining eagle claim <eos> these lowly numbers for the house of fame <eos>
a smile is curving o'er her creamy cheek <eos> her bosom swells with all a lover 's joy <eos> when love receives a message that the coy <eos> young love god made a strong and true heart speak <eos> from far off lands ; and like a mountain peak <eos> that loses in one avalanche its cloy <eos> of ice and snow , so doth her breast employ <eos> its hidden store of blushes ; and they wreak <eos> destruction , as they crush my aching heart <eos> destruction , wild , relentless , and as sure <eos> as the poor alpine hamlet 's ; and no art <eos> can hide my agony , no herb can cure <eos> my wound . her very blush says , “ we must part <eos> why was it always my fate to endure <eos>
the snow falls deep ; the forest lies alone <eos> the boy goes hasty for his load of brakes <eos> then thinks upon the fire and hurries back <eos> the gipsy knocks his hands and tucks them up <eos> and seeks his squalid camp , half hid in snow <eos> beneath the oak which breaks away the wind <eos> and bushes close in snow like hovel warm <eos> there tainted mutton wastes upon the coals <eos> and the half wasted dog squats close and rubs <eos> then feels the heat too strong , and goes aloof <eos> he watches well , but none a bit can spare <eos> and vainly waits the morsel thrown away <eos> tis thus they live — a picture to the place <eos> a quiet , pilfering , unprotected race <eos>
chaos , of old , was god 's dominion <eos> ‘ twas his belov è d child , his own first born <eos> and he was ag è d ere the thought of morn <eos> shook the sheer steeps of black oblivion <eos> then all the works of darkness being done <eos> through countless æ ons hopelessly forlorn <eos> out to the very utmost verge and bourn <eos> god at the last , reluctant , made the sun <eos> he loved his darkness still , for it was old <eos> he grieved to see his eldest child take flight <eos> and when his fiat lux the death knell tolled <eos> as the doomed darkness backward by him rolled <eos> he snatched a remnant flying into light <eos> and strewed it with the stars , and called it night <eos>
wait for the morning ! ah ! we wait indeed <eos> for daylight , we who toss about through stress <eos> of vacant armed desires and emptiness <eos> of all the warm , warm touches that we need <eos> and the warm kisses upon which we feed <eos> our famished lips in fancy ! may god bless <eos> the starved lips of us with but one caress <eos> warm as the yearning blood our poor hearts bleed <eos> a wild prayer —! bite thy pillow , praying so <eos> toss this side , and whirl that , and moan for dawn <eos> let the clock 's seconds dribble out their woe <eos> and time be drained of sorrow ! long ago <eos> we heard the crowing cock , with answer drawn <eos> as hoarsely sad at throat as sobs ... pray on <eos>
then awful sights began to be reveal 'd <eos> which death 's dark dungeons had so long conceal 'd <eos> each grave its doomsday prisoner resign 'd <eos> bursting in noises like a hollow wind <eos> and spirits , mingling with the living then <eos> thrill 'd fearful voices with the cries of men <eos> all flying furious , grinning deep despair <eos> shaped dismal shadows on the troubled air <eos> red lightning shot its flashes as they came <eos> and passing clouds seem 'd kindling into flame <eos> and strong and stronger came the sulphury smell <eos> with demons following in the breath of hell <eos> laughing in mockery as the doom 'd complain 'd <eos> losing their pains in seeing others pain 'd <eos>
behold ! the tabernacle of god 's will <eos> this woman 's form enshrineth . what is this <eos> more glorious than all our age long bliss <eos> which shines within the shadow of her sill <eos> how shall we lift this strangeness which doth fill <eos> her human heart to breaking ,— we who miss <eos> in our immortal joy , the enlight'ning kiss <eos> of sorrow 's bitter lips whence comforts thrill <eos> how shall we sing to her of joys to come <eos> to her who bears upon her breast the sum <eos> of death 's dread gloom and heaven 's undying light <eos> lean close , ah , close , about her from above <eos> behold upon the mildness of her love <eos> enthroned the terrors of his holy might <eos>
if that one care had our two hearts possessed <eos> or you once ( felt ) what i long suffer è d <eos> then should thy heart accuse in my heart 's stead <eos> the rigour of itself for mine unrest <eos> then should thine arm upon my shoulder rest <eos> and weight of grief sway down thy troubled head <eos> then should thy tears upon my sheet be shed <eos> and then thy heart should pant upon my breast <eos> but when that other cares thy heart do seize <eos> alas , what succour gain i then by this <eos> but double grief for thine and mine unease <eos> yet when thou see'st thy hurts to wound my heart <eos> and so art taught by me what pity is <eos> perhaps thy heart will learn to feel my smart <eos>

when night first spread her curtain o'er the deep <eos> firm based beneath the waves the lighthouse tower <eos> rose to the clouds , and mariners once more <eos> blest the bright gleam that o'er them ward would keep <eos> when rose the moon , the sea lay all asleep <eos> it 's dreaming waves enfolded by the shore <eos> and founded on the rock , of iron its door <eos> the beacon flashed its light across the deep <eos> then rose the storm and lashed the waves until <eos> they roared like wounded lions , and there raved <eos> the elemental forces , shock on shock <eos> and all the great sea 's batteries worked their will <eos> that never more should ship through it be saved <eos> the rising sun looked out and saw — the rock <eos>
if in the spirit glows no spark divine <eos> if soulless dust return to dust again <eos> if , after life , but death and dark remain <eos> then it were well to make the moment thine <eos> bacchante steeping soul and sense in wine <eos> in lotus lulling languors , fond desires <eos> that heat the heart with fierce , unhallowed fires <eos> till pleasure , circe like , transform us into swine <eos> but if some subtler spirit thrill our clay <eos> some god like flame illume this fleeting dust <eos> promethean fire snatched from the olympian height <eos> then must we choose the nobler , higher way <eos> seeking the beautiful , the pure , the just <eos> the ultimate crowned triumph of the right <eos>
eastward was built a gate of marble white <eos> the like adorn 'd the western opposite <eos> a nobler object than this fabric was <eos> rome never saw ; nor of so vast a space <eos> for rich with spoils of many a conquer 'd land <eos> all arts and artists theseus could command <eos> who sold for hire , or wrought for better fame <eos> the master painters , and the carvers came <eos> so rose within the compass of the year <eos> an age 's work , a glorious theatre <eos> then o'er its eastern gate was raised above <eos> a temple , sacred to the queen of love <eos> an altar stood below : on either hand <eos> a priest with roses crown 'd , who held a myrtle wand <eos>

weary of love , my thoughts of love complained <eos> till reason told them there was no such power <eos> and bade me view fair beauty 's richest flower <eos> to see if there a naked boy remained <eos> dear , to thine eyes , eyes that my soul hath pained <eos> thoughts turned them back in that unhappy hour <eos> to see if love kept there his royal bower <eos> for if not there , then no place him contained <eos> there was he not , nor boy , nor golden bow <eos> yet as thou turned thy chaste fair eye aside <eos> a flame of fire did from thine eyelids go <eos> which burnt my heart through my sore wounded side <eos> then with a sigh , reason made thoughts to cry <eos> “ there is no god of love , save that thine eye <eos>
at length the awful revelation came <eos> crushing at once his pride of birth and name <eos> the hopes his yearning bosom forward cast <eos> and the ancestral glories of the past <eos> all fell together , crumbling in disgrace <eos> a turret rent from battlement to base <eos> his daughters talking in the dead of night <eos> in their own chamber , and without a light <eos> listening , as he was wont , he overheard <eos> and learned the dreadful secret , word by word <eos> and hurrying from his castle , with a cry <eos> he raised his hands to the unpitying sky <eos> repeating one dread word , till bush and tree <eos> caught it , and shuddering answered , “ heresy <eos>

since we must sleep the endless sleep at last <eos> since life 's grim juggernaut ‘ neath ruthless wheels <eos> crushes the heart ; since age like winter steals <eos> on youth 's fair flowered fields with blighting blast <eos> then to the gods our doubts and fears be cast <eos> enough of sorrow ! joyance is our due <eos> gather the roses ! spurn th ’ envenomed rue <eos> fling to the waiting winds the pallid past <eos> steep thee in mellow moods and dear desires <eos> pluck love 's flame hearted flower ere it dies <eos> cull nectared kisses sweet as morning 's breath <eos> warm chastity at passion 's purple fires <eos> nepenthe quaff — till drained the chalice lies <eos> after ... the shrouded sleep , the dreamless dark of death <eos>

at length he said :— i know not what to do <eos> undressing , by myself , i can n't pursue <eos> shall i your valet call ? rejoined the fair <eos> on no account , said he , with looks of care <eos> i would not have you in my chamber seen <eos> nor thought that here , by night , a girl had been <eos> your caution is enough , the belle replied <eos> myself between the wall and bed i 'll hide <eos> ‘ twill what you fear prevent , and ills avoid <eos> but bolt the door : you 'll then be not annoyed <eos> let no one come ; for once i 'll do my best <eos> and as your valet act till you 're undressed <eos> to am'rous constance this permission grant <eos> the honour would her throbbing breast enchant <eos>
had she not been so excellently fair <eos> my muse had never mourned in lines of woe <eos> but i did too inestimable weigh her <eos> and that 's the cause i now lament me so <eos> yet not for her contempt do i complain me <eos> complaints may ease the mind , but that is all <eos> therefore though she too constantly disdain me <eos> i can but sigh and grieve , and so i shall <eos> yet grieve i not because i must grieve ever <eos> and yet , alas , waste tears away , in vain <eos> i am resolv è d truly to pers è ver <eos> though she persisteth in her old disdain <eos> but that which grieves me most is that i see <eos> those which most fair , the most unkindest be <eos>

go now , my friend , drink in with all your eyes <eos> bronze , silver , marble , gems , and tyrian dyes <eos> feel pride when speaking in the sight of rome <eos> go early out to ‘ change and late come home <eos> for fear your income drop beneath the rate <eos> that comes to mutus from his wife 's estate <eos> and ( shame and scandal !) , though his line is new <eos> you give the pas to him , not he to you <eos> whate'er is buried mounts at last to light <eos> while things get hid in turn that once looked bright <eos> so when agrippa 's mall and appius ’ way <eos> have watched your well known figure day by day <eos> at length the summons comes , and you must go <eos> to numa and to ancus down below <eos>
how can i then return in happy plight <eos> that am debarred the benefit of rest <eos> when day 's oppression is not eased by night <eos> but day by night and night by day oppressed <eos> and each ( though enemies to either 's reign <eos> do in consent shake hands to torture me <eos> the one by toil , the other to complain <eos> how far i toil , still farther off from thee <eos> i tell the day to please him thou art bright <eos> and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven <eos> so flatter i the swart complexioned night <eos> when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even <eos> but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer <eos> and night doth nightly make grief 's length seem stronger <eos>
were i the poet laureate of the fairies <eos> who in a rose leaf finds too broad a page <eos> or could i , like your beautiful canaries <eos> sing with free heart and happy , in a cage <eos> perhaps i might within this little space <eos> ( as in some eastern tale , by magic power <eos> a giant is imprisoned in a flower <eos> have told you something with a poet 's grace <eos> but i need wider limits , ampler scope <eos> a world of freedom for a world of passion <eos> and even then , the glory of my hope <eos> would not be uttered in its stateliest fashion <eos> yet , lady , when fit language shall have told it <eos> you 'll find one little heart enough to hold it <eos>

mild arch of promise ! on the evening sky <eos> thou shinest fair with many a lovely ray <eos> each in the other melting . much mine eye <eos> delights to linger on thee ; for the day <eos> changeful and many weather 'd , seem 'd to smile <eos> flashing brief splendor thro ’ its clouds awhile <eos> that deepen 'd dark anon and fell in rain <eos> but pleasant is it now to pause , and view <eos> thy various tints of frail and watery hue <eos> and think the storm shall not return again <eos> such is the smile that piety bestows <eos> on the good man 's pale cheek , when he in peace <eos> departing gently from a world of woes <eos> anticipates the realm where sorrows cease <eos>
being your slave what should i do but tend <eos> upon the hours , and times of your desire <eos> i have no precious time at all to spend <eos> nor services to do till you require <eos> nor dare i chide the world without end hour <eos> whilst i ( my sovereign ) watch the clock for you <eos> nor think the bitterness of absence sour <eos> when you have bid your servant once adieu <eos> nor dare i question with my jealous thought <eos> where you may be , or your affairs suppose <eos> but like a sad slave stay and think of nought <eos> save where you are , how happy you make those <eos> so true a fool is love , that in your will <eos> ( though you do any thing ) he thinks no ill <eos>

lo , the poor indian ! whose untutor 'd mind <eos> sees god in clouds , or hears him in the wind <eos> his soul , proud science never taught to stray <eos> far as the solar walk , or milky way <eos> yet simple nature to his hope has giv'n <eos> behind the cloud topt hill , an humbler heav'n <eos> some safer world in depth of woods embrac 'd <eos> some happier island in the watry waste <eos> where slaves once more their native land behold <eos> no fiends torment , no christians thirst for gold <eos> to be , contents his natural desire <eos> he asks no angel 's wing , no seraph 's fire <eos> but thinks , admitted to that equal sky <eos> his faithful dog shall bear him company <eos>

i must not think of thee ; and , tired yet strong <eos> i shun the thought that lurks in all delight <eos> the thought of thee — and in the blue heaven 's height <eos> and in the dearest passage of a song <eos> oh , just beyond the fairest thoughts that throng <eos> this breast the thought of thee waits , hidden yet bright <eos> but it must never , never come in sight <eos> i must stop short of thee the whole day long <eos> but when sleep comes to close each difficult day <eos> when night gives pause to the long watch i keep <eos> and all my bonds i needs must loose apart <eos> must doff my will as raiment laid away <eos> with the first dream that comes with the first sleep <eos> i run , i run , i am gathered to thy heart <eos>
then came a postscript dashed across the rest <eos> see that there be no traitors in your camp <eos> we seem a nest of traitors — none to trust <eos> since our arms failed — this egypt plague of men <eos> almost our maids were better at their homes <eos> than thus man girdled here : indeed i think <eos> our chiefest comfort is the little child <eos> of one unworthy mother ; which she left <eos> she shall not have it back : the child shall grow <eos> to prize the authentic mother of her mind <eos> i took it for an hour in mine own bed <eos> this morning : there the tender orphan hands <eos> felt at my heart , and seemed to charm from thence <eos> the wrath i nursed against the world : farewell <eos>
fair helen to the scaean portals came <eos> where sat the elders , peers of priamus <eos> thymoetas , hiketaon , panthous <eos> and many another of a noble name <eos> famed warriors , now in council more of fame <eos> always above the gates , in converse thus <eos> they chattered like cicalas garrulous <eos> who marking helen , swore “ it is no shame <eos> that armed achaean knights , and ilian men <eos> for such a woman 's sake should suffer long <eos> fair as a deathless goddess seemeth she <eos> nay , but aboard the red prowed ships again <eos> home let her pass in peace , not working wrong <eos> to us , and children 's children yet to be <eos>
the knell of whitehead tolls !— his cares are past <eos> the hapless tribute of his purchas 'd lays <eos> his servile , his egyptian tasks of praise <eos> if not sublime his strains , fame justly plac 'd <eos> their power above their work .— now , with wide gaze <eos> of much indignant wonder , she surveys <eos> to the life labouring oar assiduous haste <eos> a glowing bard , by every muse embrac 'd <eos> o , warton ! chosen priest of ph œ bus ’ choir <eos> shall thy rapt song be venal ? hymn the throne <eos> whether its edicts just applause inspire <eos> or patriot virtue view them with a frown <eos> what needs for this the golden stringed lyre <eos> the snowy tunic , and the sun bright zone <eos>
then in her tears she slept , but sleeping sighed <eos> as if that vision passed again — “ the time <eos> the time is come ! ” whereat siddartha turned <eos> and , lo ! the moon shone by the crab ! the stars <eos> in that same silver order long foretold <eos> stood ranged to say : “ this is the night !— choose thou <eos> the way of greatness or the way of good <eos> to reign a king of kings , or wander lone <eos> crownless and homeless , that the world be helped <eos> moreover , with the whispers of the gloom <eos> came to his ears again that warning song <eos> as when the devas spoke upon the wind <eos> and surely gods were round about the place <eos> watching our lord , who watched the shining stars <eos>
“ so saying , he strode on — kunti 's strong son <eos> and bh í ma , and arjuna followed him <eos> and nakula , and the hound ; leaving behind <eos> sahadev in the sands . but nakula <eos> weakened and grieved to see sahadev fall <eos> his loved twin brother — lagged and stayed ; and next <eos> prone on his face he fell , that noble face <eos> which had no match for beauty in the land <eos> glorious and godlike nakula ! then sighed <eos> bh í ma anew : ‘ brother and lord ! the man <eos> who never erred from virtue , never broke <eos> our fellowship , and never in the world <eos> was matched for goodly perfectness of form <eos> or gracious feature ,— nakula has fallen <eos>
with eager haste descending on the coast <eos> thro the glad states they march their veteran host <eos> from sea nursed newport file o'er western roads <eos> pitch many a camp , and bridge a hundred floods <eos> pass the full towns , where joyful crowds admire <eos> their foreign speech , gay mien and gilt attire <eos> applaud their generous deeds , the zeal that draws <eos> their swords untried in freedom 's doubtful cause <eos> thro hartford plains , on litchfield hills they gleam <eos> wave their white flags o'er hudson 's loaded stream <eos> band after band with delaware 's current pour <eos> shade schuylkill 's wave and elk 's indented shore <eos> join their new friends , where allied banners lead <eos> demand the foe and bid the war proceed <eos>
one spirit it is that stirs the fathomless deep <eos> of human minds , that shakes the elms in storm <eos> that sings in passionate music , or on warm <eos> still evenings bosoms forth the tufted sleep <eos> of thistle seeds that wait a travelling wind <eos> one spirit shapes the subtle rhythms of thought <eos> and the long thundering seas ; the soul is wrought <eos> of one stuff with the body — matter and mind <eos> woven together in so close a mesh <eos> that flowers may blossom into a song , that flesh <eos> may strangely teach the loveliest holiest things <eos> to watching spirits . truth is brought to birth <eos> not in some vacant heaven : its beauty springs <eos> from the dear bosom of material earth <eos>
when the dread trumpet sounds , the slumbering dust <eos> not unattentive to the call , shall wake <eos> and every joint possess its proper place <eos> with a new elegance of form unknown <eos> to its first state . nor shall the conscious soul <eos> mistake its partner , but , amidst the crowd <eos> singling its other half , into its arms <eos> shall rush with all the impatience of a man <eos> that 's new come home , who having long been absent <eos> with haste runs over every different room <eos> in pain to see the whole . thrice happy meeting <eos> nor time nor death shall part them ever more <eos> ‘ tis but a night , a long and moonless night <eos> we make the grave our bed , and then are gone <eos>
delight in your bright eyes my death did breed <eos> as light and glittering weapons babes allure <eos> to play with fire and sword , and so procure <eos> then to be burnt and hurt ere they take heed <eos> thy beauty so hath made me burn and bleed <eos> yet shall my ashes and my blood assure <eos> thy beauty 's fame forever to endure <eos> for thy fame 's life from my death doth proceed <eos> because my heart to ashes burn è d giveth <eos> life to thy fame , thou right a phoenix art <eos> and like a pelican thy beauty liveth <eos> by sucking blood out of my breast and heart <eos> lo why with wonder we may thee compare <eos> unto the pelican and phoenix rare <eos>
they pass me by like shadows , crowds on crowds <eos> dim ghosts of men , that hover to and fro <eos> hugging their bodies round them like thin shrouds <eos> wherein their souls were buried long ago <eos> they trampled on their youth , and faith , and love <eos> they cast their hope of human kind away <eos> with heaven 's clear messages they madly strove <eos> and conquered ,— and their spirits turned to clay <eos> lo ! how they wander round the world , their grave <eos> whose ever gaping maw by such is fed <eos> gibbering at living men , and idly rave <eos> ‘ we only truly live , but ye are dead <eos> alas ! poor fools , the anointed eye may trace <eos> a dead soul 's epitaph in every face <eos>
“ but if you suffer from a chill attack <eos> or other chance should lay you on your back <eos> you then have one who 'll sit by your bed side <eos> will see the needful remedies applied <eos> and call in a physician , to restore <eos> your health , and give you to your friends once more <eos> nor wife nor son desires your welfare : all <eos> detest you , neighbours , gossips , great and small <eos> what marvel if , when wealth 's your one concern <eos> none offers you the love you never earn <eos> nay , would you win the kinsmen nature sends <eos> made ready to your hand , and keep them friends <eos> ‘ twere but lost labour , as if one should train <eos> a donkey for the course by bit and rein <eos>
amid the florid multitude her face <eos> was like the full moon seen behind the lace <eos> of orchard boughs where clouded blossoms part <eos> when spring shines in the world and in the heart <eos> as the full moon beams to the ferny floor <eos> of summer woods through flower and foliage pour <eos> so to my being 's innermost recess <eos> flooded the light of so much loveliness <eos> she held as in a vase of priceless ware <eos> the wine that over arid ways and bare <eos> my youth was the pathetic thirsting for <eos> and where she moved the veil of nature grew <eos> diaphanous and that radiance mantled through <eos> which , when i see , i tremble and adore <eos>
superb and sole , upon a plumed spray <eos> that o'er the general leafage boldly grew <eos> he summ 'd the woods in song ; or typic drew <eos> the watch of hungry hawks , the lone dismay <eos> of languid doves when long their lovers stray <eos> and all birds ’ passion plays that sprinkle dew <eos> at morn in brake or bosky avenue <eos> what e'er birds did or dreamed , this bird could say <eos> then down he shot , bounced airily along <eos> the sward , twitched in a grasshopper , made song <eos> midflight , perched , prinked , and to his art again <eos> sweet science , this large riddle read me plain <eos> how may the death of that dull insect be <eos> the life of yon trim shakspere on the tree <eos>
are there two things , of all which men possess <eos> that are so like each other and so near <eos> as mutual love seems like to happiness <eos> dear asra , woman beyond utterance dear <eos> this love which ever welling at my heart <eos> now in its living fount doth heave and fall <eos> now overflowing pours thro ’ every part <eos> of all my frame , and fills and changes all <eos> like vernal waters springing up through snow <eos> this love that seeming great beyond the power <eos> of growth , yet seemeth ever more to grow <eos> could i transmute the whole to one rich dower <eos> of happy life , and give it all to thee <eos> thy lot , methinks , were heaven , thy age , eternity <eos>
some say thy fault is youth , some wantonness <eos> some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport <eos> both grace and faults are loved of more and less <eos> thou mak'st faults graces , that to thee resort <eos> as on the finger of a throned queen <eos> the basest jewel will be well esteemed <eos> so are those errors that in thee are seen <eos> to truths translated , and for true things deemed <eos> how many lambs might the stern wolf betray <eos> if like a lamb he could his looks translate <eos> how many gazers mightst thou lead away <eos> if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state <eos> but do not so , i love thee in such sort <eos> as thou being mine , mine is thy good report <eos>
o me ! what eyes hath love put in my head <eos> which have no correspondence with true sight <eos> or if they have , where is my judgment fled <eos> that censures falsely what they see aright <eos> if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote <eos> what means the world to say it is not so <eos> if it be not , then love doth well denote <eos> love 's eye is not so true as all men 's : no <eos> how can it ? o how can love 's eye be true <eos> that is so vexed with watching and with tears <eos> no marvel then though i mistake my view <eos> the sun it self sees not , till heaven clears <eos> o cunning love , with tears thou keep'st me blind <eos> lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find <eos>
so is it not with me as with that muse <eos> stirred by a painted beauty to his verse <eos> who heaven it self for ornament doth use <eos> and every fair with his fair doth rehearse <eos> making a couplement of proud compare <eos> with sun and moon , with earth and sea 's rich gems <eos> with april 's first born flowers and all things rare <eos> that heaven 's air in this huge rondure hems <eos> o let me true in love but truly write <eos> and then believe me , my love is as fair <eos> as any mother 's child , though not so bright <eos> as those gold candles fixed in heaven 's air <eos> let them say more that like of hearsay well <eos> i will not praise that purpose not to sell <eos>
and you as well must die , beloved dust <eos> and all your beauty stand you in no stead <eos> this flawless , vital hand , this perfect head <eos> this body of flame and steel , before the gust <eos> of death , or under his autumnal frost <eos> shall be as any leaf , be no less dead <eos> than the first leaf that fell ,— this wonder fled <eos> altered , estranged , disintegrated , lost <eos> nor shall my love avail you in your hour <eos> in spite of all my love , you will arise <eos> upon that day and wander down the air <eos> obscurely as the unattended flower <eos> it mattering not how beautiful you were <eos> or how beloved above all else that dies <eos>
they say a man ne'er bore such love to man <eos> or , if he did , ‘ twere but a cause for shame <eos> but , speaking so , they their own measure scan <eos> and blot their censure with self blaming blame <eos> for , thou being beauty 's best , the best of me <eos> worshipp 'd but beauty 's self and beauty 's worth <eos> my fire and air , my spirit , ador è d thee <eos> unmix 'd with gross compounding of my earth <eos> and thou wert best of truth , the first in grace <eos> of all rich gems in virtue 's carcanet <eos> then should i not love thee and give thee place <eos> above all love of sense on woman set <eos> in love of beauty , whate'er shape ‘ tis in <eos> there 's nought of truth , if it must think of sin <eos>
i love to rise ere gleams the tardy light <eos> winter 's pale dawn ;— and as warm fires illume <eos> and cheerful tapers shine around the room <eos> thro ’ misty windows bend my musing sight <eos> where , round the dusky lawn , the mansions white <eos> with shutters clos 'd , peer faintly thro ’ the gloom <eos> that slow recedes ; while yon grey spires assume <eos> rising from their dark pile , an added height <eos> by indistinctness given .— then to decree <eos> the grateful thoughts to god , ere they unfold <eos> to friendship , or the muse , or seek with glee <eos> wisdom 's rich page !— o , hours ! more worth than gold <eos> by whose blest use we lengthen life , and free <eos> from drear decays of age , outlive the old <eos>
wilt thou love god as he thee ? then digest <eos> my soul ! this wholesome meditation <eos> how god the spirit , by angels waited on <eos> in heaven , doth make his temple in thy breast <eos> the father having begot a son most blest <eos> and still begetting , ( for he ne'er begun <eos> hath deigned to choose thee by adoption <eos> co heir to his glory , and sabbath 's endless rest <eos> and as a robbed man , which by search doth find <eos> his stol'n stuff sold , must lose or buy ‘ t again <eos> the sun of glory came down and was slain <eos> us , whom he had made , and satan stole , to unbind <eos> ‘ twas much that man was made like god before <eos> but that god should be made like man much more <eos>
as in the twilight brown , on hillside bare <eos> useth to go the little shepherd maid <eos> watering some strange fair plant , poorly displayed <eos> ill thriving in unwonted soil and air <eos> far from its native springtime 's genial care <eos> so on my ready tongue hath love assayed <eos> in a strange speech to wake new flower and blade <eos> while i of thee , proud yet so debonair <eos> sing songs whose sense is to my people lost <eos> yield the fair thames , and the fair arno gain <eos> love willed it so , and i , at others ’ cost <eos> already knew love never willed in vain <eos> would my heart slow and bosom hard were found <eos> to him who plants from heaven so fair a ground <eos>
o true , they have a cause , and woe for us <eos> while still they have a cause too piteous <eos> yet , happy for us when , their cause defined <eos> they walk no longer with a stumbler blind <eos> and quicken in the virtue of their cause <eos> to think me a poor mouther of old saws <eos> i wait the issue of a battling age <eos> the toilers with your ‘ troughsters ’ now engage <eos> instructing them , through their acutest sense <eos> how close the dangers of indifference <eos> already have my people shown their worth <eos> more love they light , which folds the love of earth <eos> that love to love of labour leads : thence love <eos> of humankind — earth 's incense flung above <eos>
great ajax telamon first hyrtius smote <eos> the son of gyrtius , who to battle led <eos> the warlike mysians ; next antilochus <eos> from mermerus and phalces stripp 'd their arms <eos> meriones hippotion gave to death <eos> and morys ; teucer periphetes slew <eos> and prothoon ; menelaus , through the flank <eos> smote hyperenor ; as the grinding spear <eos> drain 'd all his vitals , through the gaping wound <eos> his spirit escap 'd , and darkness clos 'd his eyes <eos> but chiefest slaughter of the trojans wrought <eos> oileus ’ active son ; of all the greeks <eos> no foot so swift as his , when jove had fill 'd <eos> their souls with fear , to chase the flying foe <eos>
‘ my friends , ’ he cried ( and cast a mournful look <eos> around the room , and sigh 'd before he spoke <eos> ‘ beneath the weight of threescore years i bend <eos> and , worn with cares , am hastening to my end <eos> how i have lived , alas ! you know too well <eos> in worldly follies which i blush to tell <eos> but gracious heaven has oped my eyes at last <eos> with due regret i view my vices past <eos> and , as the precept of the church decrees <eos> will take a wife , and live in holy ease <eos> but since by counsel all things should be done <eos> and many heads are wiser still than one <eos> choose you for me , who best shall be content <eos> when my desire 's approved by your consent <eos>
two loves i have of comfort and despair <eos> which like two spirits do suggest me still <eos> the better angel is a man right fair <eos> the worser spirit a woman coloured ill <eos> to win me soon to hell my female evil <eos> tempteth my better angel from my side <eos> and would corrupt my saint to be a devil <eos> wooing his purity with her foul pride <eos> and whether that my angel be turned fiend <eos> suspect i may , yet not directly tell <eos> but being both from me both to each friend <eos> i guess one angel in another 's hell <eos> yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt <eos> till my bad angel fire my good one out <eos>
now that we 've done our best and worst , and parted <eos> i would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend <eos> ( o heart , i do not dare go empty hearted <eos> i 'll think of love in books , love without end <eos> women with child , content ; and old men sleeping <eos> and wet strong ploughlands , scarred for certain grain <eos> and babes that weep , and so forget their weeping <eos> and the young heavens , forgetful after rain <eos> and evening hush , broken by homing wings <eos> and song 's nobility and wisdom holy <eos> that live , we dead . i would think of a thousand things <eos> lovely and durable , and taste them slowly <eos> one after one , like tasting a sweet food <eos> i have need to busy my heart with quietude <eos>
what shall i say to you ? what can i say <eos> better than silence is ? when i survey <eos> this throng of faces turned to meet my own <eos> friendly and fair , and yet to me unknown <eos> transformed the very landscape seems to be <eos> it is the same , yet not the same to me <eos> so many memories crowd upon my brain <eos> so many ghosts are in the wooded plain <eos> i fain would steal away , with noiseless tread <eos> as from a house where some one lieth dead <eos> i cannot go ;— i pause ;— i hesitate <eos> my feet reluctant linger at the gate <eos> as one who struggles in a troubled dream <eos> to speak and cannot , to myself i seem <eos>
his brother thus with counsels wise dismiss 'd <eos> the king to aged nestor took his way <eos> him by his tent and dark ribb 'd ship he found <eos> on a soft couch ; beside him lay his arms <eos> his shield , two lances , and a glitt'ring helm <eos> there lay the rich wrought belt the old man wore <eos> when to the battle , arm 'd , he led his troops <eos> for nought to age 's weakness would he yield <eos> raising his head , and on his elbow propp 'd <eos> he question 'd thus atrides : “ who art thou <eos> that wand'rest through th ’ encampment thus alone <eos> in the dark night , when other mortals sleep <eos> seek'st thou some mule broke loose , or comrade lost <eos> speak , nor in silence come ; what wouldst thou here <eos>
lady ! where'er you roam , whatever land <eos> woos the bright touches of that artist hand <eos> whether you sketch the valley 's golden meads <eos> where mazy linth his lingering current leads <eos> enamored catch the mellow hues that sleep <eos> at eve , on meillerie 's immortal steep <eos> or musing o'er the lake , at day 's decline <eos> mark the last shadow on that holy shrine <eos> where , many a night , the shade of tell complains <eos> of gallia 's triumph and helvetia 's chains <eos> oh ! lay the pencil for a moment by <eos> turn from the canvas that creative eye <eos> and let its splendor , like the morning ray <eos> upon a shepherd 's harp , illume my lay <eos>
and then with her round , brown arms she pressed <eos> his phantom form to her throbbing breast <eos> and whispered the name , in her happy sleep <eos> of her h ó h é hunter so fair and far <eos> and then she saw in her dreams the deep <eos> where the spirit wailed , and a falling star <eos> then stealthily crouching under the trees <eos> by the light of the moon , the kan ó ti dan <eos> the little , wizened , mysterious man <eos> with his long locks tossed by the moaning breeze <eos> then a flap of wings , like a thunder bird <eos> and a wailing spirit the sleeper heard <eos> and lo , through the mists of the moon , she saw <eos> the hateful visage of h â rpstin à. <eos>
all day i 've bent my heart beneath the yoke <eos> of goading toil , remembering to forget <eos> to still upon my lips his kiss that woke <eos> me in elysian love one word has broke <eos> one stinging word of severance and regret <eos> all day i 've blotted from my eyes his face <eos> but now at evening tide it comes again <eos> and memories into my darkened soul <eos> rush as the stars into high heaven 's space <eos> as the bright stars ! but , ah , tomorrow ! when <eos> once more i must forget and see life 's goal <eos> that was so green , with sering laurel hung <eos> tomorrow and tomorrow ! till is wrung <eos> peace from the piteous hours i strive among <eos>
point to the summits where the brave have bled <eos> where every village claims its glorious dead <eos> say , when their bosoms met the bayonet 's shock <eos> their only corselet was the rustic frock <eos> say , when they mustered to the gathering horn <eos> the titled chieftain curled his lip in scorn <eos> yet , when their leader bade his lines advance <eos> no musket wavered in the lion 's glance <eos> say , when they fainted in the forced retreat <eos> they tracked the snow drifts with their bleeding feet <eos> yet still their banners , tossing in the blast <eos> bore ever ready , faithful to the last <eos> through storm and battle , till they waved again <eos> on yorktown 's hills and saratoga 's plain <eos>
once in a dream ( for once i dreamed of you <eos> we stood together in an open field <eos> above our heads two swift winged pigeons wheeled <eos> sporting at ease and courting full in view <eos> when loftier still a broadening darkness flew <eos> down swooping , and a ravenous hawk revealed <eos> too weak to fight , too fond to fly , they yield <eos> so farewell life and love and pleasures new <eos> then as their plumes fell fluttering to the ground <eos> their snow white plumage flecked with crimson drops <eos> i wept , and thought i turned towards you to weep <eos> but you were gone ; while rustling hedgerow tops <eos> bent in a wind which bore to me a sound <eos> of far off piteous bleat of lambs and sheep <eos>
‘ tis gross to squander hundreds upon fish <eos> yet pen them cooked within too small a dish <eos> so too it turns the stomach , if there sticks <eos> dirt to the bowl wherein your wine you mix <eos> or if the servant , who behind you stands <eos> has fouled the beaker with his greasy hands <eos> brooms , dish cloths , saw dust , what a mite they cost <eos> neglect them though , your reputation 's lost <eos> what ? sweep with dirty broom a floor inlaid <eos> spread unwashed cloths o'er tapestry and brocade <eos> forgetting , sure , the less such things entail <eos> of care and cost , the more the shame to fail <eos> worse than fall short in luxuries , which one sees <eos> at no man 's table but your rich grandees <eos>
and hither does one poet sometimes row <eos> his pinnace , a small vagrant barge , up piled <eos> with plenteous store of heath and wither 'd fern <eos> a lading which he with his sickle cuts <eos> among the mountains , and beneath this roof <eos> he makes his summer couch , and here at noon <eos> spreads out his limbs , while , yet unborn , the sheep <eos> panting beneath the burthen of their wool <eos> lie round him , even as if they were a part <eos> of his own household : nor , while from his bed <eos> he through that door place looks toward the lake <eos> and to the stirring breezes , does he want <eos> creations lovely as the work of sleep <eos> fair sights , and visions of romantic joy <eos>
with that delight the royal captiv 's < 46. 2 > brought <eos> before the throne , to breath his farewell thought <eos> to tel his last tale , and so end with it <eos> which gladly he esteemes a benefit <eos> when the brave victor , at his great soule dumbe <eos> findes something there fate cannot overcome <eos> cals the chain 'd prince , and by his glory led <eos> first reaches him his crowne , and then his head <eos> who ne 're ‘ til now thinks himself slave and poor <eos> for though nought else , he had himselfe before <eos> he weepes at this faire chance , nor wil allow <eos> but that the diadem doth brand his brow <eos> and under rates himselfe below mankinde <eos> who first had lost his body , now his minde <eos>
such to the rabble may appear inspir 'd <eos> by coxcombs envy 'd , and by fools admir 'd <eos> i pity madmen who attempt to fly <eos> and raise their airy babel to the sky <eos> who , arm 'd with gabble , to create a name <eos> design a beauty , and a monster frame <eos> not so the seat of phoebus role , which lay <eos> in ruins buried , and a long decay <eos> to britany the temple was convey 'd <eos> by natures utmost force , and more than human aid <eos> built from the basis by a noble few <eos> the stately fabrick in perfection view <eos> while nature gazes on the polish 'd piece <eos> the work of many rowling centuries <eos>
the chief hung up :— the princess soon appeared <eos> her spirits presently our champion cheered <eos> the pirate scarcely had her bosom moved <eos> no tears at least a marked affection proved <eos> but , by her prayers she pardon sought to gain <eos> for some who were not in the conflict slain <eos> consoled the dying , and lamented those <eos> who , by the sword , had closed their book of woes <eos> then left the place without the least regret <eos> where such adventures and alarms she 'd met <eos> ‘ tis said , indeed , she presently forgot <eos> the two gallants who last became her lot <eos> and i can easily the fact believe <eos> removed from sight , but few for lovers grieve <eos>
“ the angels , o my brother ! and this clime <eos> wherein thou art , impassible and pure <eos> i call created , as indeed they are <eos> in their whole being . but the elements <eos> which thou hast nam 'd , and what of them is made <eos> are by created virtue ’ inform 'd : create <eos> their substance , and create the ’ informing virtue <eos> in these bright stars , that round them circling move <eos> the soul of every brute and of each plant <eos> the ray and motion of the sacred lights <eos> with complex potency attract and turn <eos> but this our life the ’ eternal good inspires <eos> immediate , and enamours of itself <eos> so that our wishes rest for ever here <eos>
th ’ expense of spirit in a waste of shame <eos> is lust in action , and till action , lust <eos> is perjured , murd'rous , bloody full of blame <eos> savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust <eos> enjoyed no sooner but despised straight <eos> past reason hunted , and no sooner had <eos> past reason hated as a swallowed bait <eos> on purpose laid to make the taker mad <eos> mad in pursuit and in possession so <eos> had , having , and in quest , to have extreme <eos> a bliss in proof and proved , a very woe <eos> before a joy proposed behind a dream <eos> all this the world well knows yet none knows well <eos> to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell <eos>
because i oft in dark abstracted guise <eos> seem most alone in greatest company <eos> with dearth of words , or answers quite awry <eos> to them that would make speech of speech arise <eos> they deem , and of their doom the rumour flies <eos> that poison foul of bubbling pride doth lie <eos> so in my swelling breast , that only i <eos> fawn on myself , and others do despise <eos> yet pride , i think , doth not my soul possess <eos> which looks too oft in his unflattering glass <eos> but one worse fault , ambition , i confess <eos> that makes me oft my best friends overpass <eos> unseen , unheard , while thought to highest place <eos> bends all his powers , even unto stella 's grace <eos>
the stars die out on avon 's watchful breast <eos> while simple shepherds climb through shadows grey <eos> with beating bosoms up the wrekin 's crest <eos> to see the sun “ dance in ” an easter day <eos> whose dawning consummates three centuries <eos> since shakespeare 's death and entrance to the skies <eos> resolved the radiant miracle not to miss <eos> reserved alone to earliest opened eyes <eos> we , too , with faces set towards the east <eos> our joyful orison offerings yielding up <eos> keep with our risen lord his pascal feast <eos> from paten blest and consecrated cup <eos> and give him thanks who of all realms of earth <eos> made england richest by her shakespeare 's birth <eos>
the church bells tolled , the chant of monks drew near <eos> loud trumpets stammered forth their notes of fear <eos> a line of torches smoked along the street <eos> there was a stir , a rush , a tramp of feet <eos> and , with its banners floating in the air <eos> slowly the long procession crossed the square <eos> and , to the statues of the prophets bound <eos> the victims stood , with fagots piled around <eos> then all the air a blast of trumpets shook <eos> and louder sang the monks with bell and book <eos> and the hidalgo , lofty , stern , and proud <eos> lifted his torch , and , bursting through the crowd <eos> lighted in haste the fagots , and then fled <eos> lest those imploring eyes should strike him dead <eos>
some foreign writers , some our own despise <eos> the ancients only , or the moderns prize <eos> thus wit , like faith , by each man is applied <eos> to one small sect , and all are damned beside <eos> meanly they seek the blessing to confine <eos> and force that sun but on a part to shine <eos> which not alone the southern wit sublimes <eos> but ripens spirits in cold northern climes <eos> which from the first has shone on ages past <eos> enlights the present , and shall warm the last <eos> though each may feel increases and decays <eos> and see now clearer and now darker days <eos> regard not , then , if wit be old or new <eos> but blame the false , and value still the true <eos>
yet , oh ! believe me , mid this mingled maze <eos> of nature 's beauties , where the fancy strays <eos> from charm to charm , where every floweret 's hue <eos> hath something strange , and every leaf is new <eos> i never feel a joy so pure and still <eos> so inly felt , as when some brook or hill <eos> or veteran oak , like those remembered well <eos> some mountain echo or some wild flower 's smell <eos> ( for , who can say by what small fairy ties <eos> the memory clings to pleasure as it flies <eos> reminds my heart of many a silvan dream <eos> i once indulged by trent 's inspiring stream <eos> of all my sunny morns and moonlight nights <eos> on donington 's green lawns and breezy heights <eos>
despised ! rejected by the priest led roar <eos> of the multitude ! the imperial purple flung <eos> about the form the hissing scourge had stung <eos> witnessing naked to the truth it bore <eos> true son of father true , i thee adore <eos> even the mocking purple truthful hung <eos> on thy true shoulders , bleeding its folds among <eos> for thou wast king , art king for evermore <eos> i know the father : he knows me the truth <eos> truth witness , therefore the one essential king <eos> with thee i die , with thee live worshipping <eos> o human god , o brother , eldest born <eos> never but thee was there a man in sooth <eos> never a true crown but thy crown of thorn <eos>

edith ( rising and breaking into a kind of chant <eos> truly we do but grope here in the dark <eos> near the partition wall of life and death <eos> at every moment dreading or desiring <eos> to lay our hands upon the unseen door <eos> let us , then , labor for an inward stillness <eos> an inward stillness and an inward healing <eos> that perfect silence where the lips and heart <eos> are still , and we no longer entertain <eos> our own imperfect thoughts and vain opinions <eos> but god alone speaks in us , and we wait <eos> in singleness of heart , that we may know <eos> his will , and in the silence of our spirits <eos> that we may do his will , and do that only <eos>
the palid thunderstricken sigh for gain <eos> down an ideal stream they ever float <eos> and sailing on pactolus in a boat <eos> drown soul and sense , while wistfully they strain <eos> weak eyes upon the glistering sands that robe <eos> the understream . the wise could he behold <eos> cathedralled caverns of thick ribb è d gold <eos> and branching silvers of the central globe <eos> would marvel from so beautiful a sight <eos> how scorn and ruin , pain and hate could flow <eos> but hatred in a gold cave sits below <eos> pleached with her hair , in mail of argent light <eos> shot into gold , a snake her forehead clips <eos> and skins the colour from her trembling lips <eos>
be my companion under cool arcades <eos> that frame some drowsy street and dazzling square <eos> beyond whose flowers and palm tree promenades <eos> white belfries burn in the blue tropic air <eos> lie near me in dim forests where the croon <eos> of wood doves sounds and moss banked water flows <eos> or musing late till the midsummer moon <eos> breaks through some ruined abbey 's empty rose <eos> sweetest of those to day whose pious hands <eos> tend the sequestered altar of romance <eos> where fewer offerings burn , and fewer kneel <eos> pour there your passionate beauty on my heart <eos> and , gladdening such solitudes , impart <eos> how sweet the fellowship of those who feel <eos>
methinks i hear the thoughtful reader ask <eos> “ why was the man , at once , not ta'en to task <eos> why did the other men not take a part <eos> with that poor boy , and show a feeling heart <eos> i am informed they all enjoyed the joke <eos> not one reproachful word they ever spoke <eos> i blush to think that any of my trade <eos> should of such monsters ever be afraid <eos> the very thought still makes my blood to boil <eos> and shuddering , from such thoughts i back recoil <eos> i would have dragged the fiend unto a jail <eos> or had him fastened to a wagon 's tail <eos> laid bare his back , and let the lash descend <eos> and , doing this , would still my act defend <eos>
sweet hand , the sweet but cruel bow thou art <eos> from whence at me five ivory arrows fly <eos> so with five wounds at once i wounded lie <eos> bearing my breast the print of every dart <eos> saint francis had the like , yet felt no smart <eos> where i in living torments never die <eos> his wounds were in his hands and feet ; where i <eos> all these five helpless wounds feel in my heart <eos> now , as saint francis , if a saint am i <eos> the bow that shot these shafts a relic is <eos> i mean the hand , which is the reason why <eos> so many for devotion thee would kiss <eos> and some thy glove kiss as a thing divine <eos> this arrows ’ quiver , and this relic 's shrine <eos>
“ go forth , my knight of love , o'er land and sea <eos> and purify your spirit and your life <eos> and seek until you find the holy grail <eos> keeping the vision ever in your thought <eos> the inspiration ever in your soul <eos> let tristram yield his loyalty and honour <eos> for fair isoud , and die inglorious <eos> let launcelot in guenever 's embrace <eos> forget the consecrated vows he swore <eos> and bring dark desolation on the land <eos> my knight must grow the greater through his love <eos> the better for my favour , the more pure <eos> more than all gifts , or wealth of royal dower <eos> i want , i crave , i claim this boon of thee <eos>
i served my sentence — a bitter pill <eos> some fellows should take who never will <eos> and then i decided to go “ out west <eos> concludin ’ ‘ twould suit my health the best <eos> where , how i prospered , i never could tell <eos> but fortune seemed to like me well <eos> an ’ somehow every vein i struck <eos> was always bubbling over with luck <eos> an ’ , better than that , i was steady an ’ true <eos> an ’ put my good resolutions through <eos> but i wrote to a trusty old neighbor , an ’ said <eos> “ you tell ‘ em , old fellow , that i am dead <eos> an ’ died a christian ; ‘ twill please ‘ em more <eos> than if i had lived the same as before <eos>
the kind instructor in these words began <eos> “ ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now <eos> i ’ th ’ second round , and shalt be , till thou come <eos> upon the horrid sand : look therefore well <eos> around thee , and such things thou shalt behold <eos> as would my speech discredit . ” on all sides <eos> i heard sad plainings breathe , and none could see <eos> from whom they might have issu 'd . in amaze <eos> fast bound i stood . he , as it seem 'd , believ 'd <eos> that i had thought so many voices came <eos> from some amid those thickets close conceal 'd <eos> and thus his speech resum 'd : “ if thou lop off <eos> a single twig from one of those ill plants <eos> the thought thou hast conceiv 'd shall vanish quite <eos>
at length they thought of those poor hearts at home <eos> mother and sister , watching through the night <eos> waiting and watching through the livelong day <eos> startled at every step , at every sound <eos> startled at every bier that came in view <eos> in that great city of the stranger dead <eos> that city where the living come to die <eos> and home returned when evening 's rose and gold <eos> had faded from the sky , and myriad lamps <eos> danced on the sacred stream , and moon and stars <eos> hung quivering in its dark and silent depths <eos> but day by day returned , eager to hear <eos> more of that truth that sweetens daily life <eos> yet reaches upward to eternal day <eos>
in all my wanderings round this world of care <eos> in all my griefs — and god has given my share <eos> i still had hopes , my latest hours to crown <eos> amidst these humble bowers to lay me down <eos> to husband out life 's taper at the close <eos> and keep the flame from wasting by repose <eos> i still had hopes , for pride attends us still <eos> amidst the swains to show my book learned skill <eos> around my fire an evening group to draw <eos> and tell of all i felt , and all i saw <eos> and , as an hare whom hounds and horns pursue <eos> pants to the place from whence at first she flew <eos> i still had hopes , my long vexations past <eos> here to return — and die at home at last <eos>
straightway did andrew answer him again <eos> “ my lord , how can i o'er the ocean deep <eos> my course accomplish , to that distant shore <eos> as speedily as thou , o king of glory <eos> creator of the heavens , dost command <eos> that road thine angel can more easily <eos> traverse from heaven ; he knows the watery ways <eos> the salt sea streams , the wide path of the swan <eos> the battle of the surf against the shore <eos> the terror of the waters , and the tracks <eos> across the boundless land . these foreign men <eos> are not my trusty friends , nor do i know <eos> in any wise the counsels of this folk <eos> to me the cold sea highways are unknown <eos>
look in my face ; my name is might have been <eos> i am also called no more , too late , farewell <eos> unto thine ear i hold the dead sea shell <eos> cast up thy life 's foam fretted feet between <eos> unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen <eos> which had life 's form and love 's , but by my spell <eos> is now a shaken shadow intolerable <eos> of ultimate things unuttered the frail screen <eos> mark me , how still i am ! but should there dart <eos> one moment through thy soul the soft surprise <eos> of that winged peace which lulls the breath of sighs <eos> then shalt thou see me smile , and turn apart <eos> thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart <eos> sleepless with cold commemorative eyes <eos>
the poetry of earth is never dead <eos> when all the birds are faint with the hot sun <eos> and hide in cooling trees , a voice will run <eos> from hedge to hedge about the new mown mead <eos> that is the grasshopper 's — he takes the lead <eos> in summer luxury ,— he has never done <eos> with his delights , for when tired out with fun <eos> he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed <eos> the poetry of earth is ceasing never <eos> on a lone winter evening , when the frost <eos> has wrought a silence , from the stove there shrills <eos> the cricket 's song , in warmth increasing ever <eos> and seems to one in drowsiness half lost <eos> the grasshopper 's among the grassy hills <eos>

when lost francesca sobbed her broken tale <eos> of love and sin and boundless agony <eos> while that wan spirit by her side did wail <eos> and bite his lips for utter misery <eos> the grief which could not speak , nor hear , nor see <eos> so tender grew the superhuman face <eos> of one who listened , that a mighty trace <eos> of superhuman woe gave way , and pale <eos> the sudden light up struggled to its place <eos> while all his limbs began to faint and fail <eos> with such excess of pity . but , behind <eos> the roman virgil stood — the calm , the wise <eos> with not a shadow in his regal eyes <eos> a stately type of all his stately kind <eos>
hope , like the hyaena , coming to be old <eos> alters his shape , is turned into despair <eos> pity my hoary hopes , maid of clear mould <eos> think not that frowns can ever make thee fair <eos> what harm is it to kiss , to laugh , to play <eos> beauty 's no blossom , if it be not used <eos> sweet dalliance keeps the wrinkles long away <eos> repentance follows them that have refused <eos> to bring you to the knowledge of your good <eos> i seek , i sue . o try and then believe <eos> each image can be chaste that 's carved of wood <eos> you show you live , when men you do relieve <eos> iron with wearing shines ; rust wasteth treasure <eos> on earth but love there is no other pleasure <eos>

i pray you not , leuconoe , to pore <eos> with unpermitted eyes on what may be <eos> appointed by the gods for you and me <eos> nor on chaldean figures any more <eos> ‘ t were infinitely better to implore <eos> the present only : — whether jove decree <eos> more winters yet to come , or whether he <eos> make even this , whose hard , wave eaten shore <eos> shatters the tuscan seas to day , the last <eos> be wise withal , and rack your wine , nor fill <eos> your bosom with large hopes ; for while i sing <eos> the envious close of time is narrowing <eos> so seize the day , — or ever it be past <eos> and let the morrow come for what it will <eos>

take all my loves , my love , yea take them all <eos> what hast thou then more than thou hadst before <eos> no love , my love , that thou mayst true love call <eos> all mine was thine , before thou hadst this more <eos> then if for my love , thou my love receivest <eos> i cannot blame thee , for my love thou usest <eos> but yet be blamed , if thou thy self deceivest <eos> by wilful taste of what thy self refusest <eos> i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief <eos> although thou steal thee all my poverty <eos> and yet love knows it is a greater grief <eos> to bear love 's wrong , than hate 's known injury <eos> lascivious grace , in whom all ill well shows <eos> kill me with spites yet we must not be foes <eos>
i lift mine eyes , and all the windows blaze <eos> with forms of saints and holy men who died <eos> here martyred and hereafter glorified <eos> and the great rose upon its leaves displays <eos> christ 's triumph , and the angelic roundelays <eos> with splendor upon splendor multiplied <eos> and beatrice again at dante 's side <eos> no more rebukes , but smiles her words of praise <eos> and then the organ sounds , and unseen choirs <eos> sing the old latin hymns of peace and love <eos> and benedictions of the holy ghost <eos> and the melodious bells among the spires <eos> o'er all the house tops and through heaven above <eos> proclaim the elevation of the host <eos>
the sirens once were maidens innocent <eos> that through the water meads with proserpine <eos> plucked no fire hearted flowers , but were content <eos> cool fritillaries and flag flowers to twine <eos> with lilies woven and with wet woodbine <eos> till once they sought the bright aetnaean flowers <eos> and their glad mistress fled from summer hours <eos> with hades , far from olive , corn , and vine <eos> and they have sought her all the wide world through <eos> till many years , and wisdom , and much wrong <eos> have filled and changed their song , and o'er the blue <eos> rings deadly sweet the magic of the song <eos> and whoso hears must listen till he die <eos> far on the flowery shores of sicily <eos>
unchanged within , to see all changed without <eos> is a blank lot and hard to bear , no doubt <eos> yet why at others ’ wanings should'st thou fret <eos> then only might'st thou feel a just regret <eos> hadst thou withheld thy love or hid thy light <eos> in selfish forethought of neglect and slight <eos> o wiselier then , from feeble yearnings freed <eos> while , and on whom , thou may'st — shine on ! nor heed <eos> whether the object by reflected light <eos> return thy radiance or absorb it quite <eos> and though thou notest from thy safe recess <eos> old friends burn dim , like lamps in noisome air <eos> love them for what they are ; nor love them less <eos> because to thee they are not what they were <eos>

of whist or cribbage mark th ’ amusing game <eos> the partners changing , but the sport the same <eos> else would the gamester 's anxious ardour cool <eos> dull every deal , and stagnant every pool <eos> — yet must one man , with one unceasing wife <eos> play the long rubber of connubial life <eos> yes ! human laws , and laws esteemed divine <eos> the generous passion straighten and confine <eos> and , as a stream , when art constrains its course <eos> pours its fierce torrent with augmented force <eos> so passion , narrowed to one channel small <eos> unlike the former ,— does not flow at all <eos> for love then only flaps his purple wings <eos> when uncontrolled by priestcraft or by kings <eos>
“ this circuit , ” said my teacher , “ knots the scourge <eos> for envy , and the cords are therefore drawn <eos> by charity 's correcting hand . the curb <eos> is of a harsher sound , as thou shalt hear <eos> ( if i deem rightly ) , ere thou reach the pass <eos> where pardon sets them free . but fix thine eyes <eos> intently through the air , and thou shalt see <eos> a multitude before thee seated , each <eos> along the shelving grot . ” then more than erst <eos> i op 'd my eyes , before me view 'd , and saw <eos> shadows with garments dark as was the rock <eos> and when we pass 'd a little forth , i heard <eos> a crying , “ blessed mary ! pray for us <eos> michael and peter ! all ye saintly host <eos>

so many a year had borne its own bright bees <eos> and slain them since thy honey bees were hived <eos> john day , in cells of flower sweet verse contrived <eos> so well with craft of moulding melodies <eos> thy soul perchance in amaranth fields at ease <eos> thought not to hear the sound on earth revived <eos> of summer music from the spring derived <eos> when thy song sucked the flower of flowering trees <eos> but thine was not the chance of every day <eos> time , after many a darkling hour , grew sunny <eos> and light between the clouds ere sunset swam <eos> laughing , and kissed their darkness all away <eos> when , touched and tasted and approved , thy honey <eos> took subtler sweetness from the lips of lamb <eos>
here one is happy if the fickle crowd <eos> his name the threefold honor has allowed <eos> and there another , if into his stores <eos> comes what is swept from libyan threshing floors <eos> he who delights to till his father 's lands <eos> and grasps the delving hoe with willing hands <eos> can never to attalic offers hark <eos> or cut the myrtoan sea with cyprian bark <eos> the merchant , timorous of afric 's breeze <eos> when fiercely struggling with icarian seas <eos> praises the restful quiet of his home <eos> nor wishes from the peaceful fields to roam <eos> ah , speedily his shattered ships he mends <eos> to poverty his lesson ne'er extends <eos>
waves trough , rebound , and furious boil again <eos> like plunging monsters rising underneath <eos> who at the top curl up a shaggy mane <eos> a moment catching at a surer breath <eos> then plunging headlong down and down , and on <eos> each following whirls the shadow of the last <eos> and other monsters rise when those are gone <eos> crest their fringed waves , plunge onward and are past <eos> the chill air comes around me oceanly <eos> from bank to bank the waterstrife is spread <eos> strange birds like snowspots oer the whizzing sea <eos> hang where the wild duck hurried past and fled <eos> on roars the flood , all restless to be free <eos> like trouble wandering to eternity <eos>
flowers i would bring if flowers could make thee fairer <eos> and music , if the muse were dear to thee <eos> ( for loving these would make thee love the bearer <eos> but sweetest songs forget their melody <eos> and loveliest flowers would but conceal the wearer <eos> a rose i marked , and might have plucked ; but she <eos> blushed as she bent , imploring me to spare her <eos> nor spoil her beauty by such rivalry <eos> alas ! and with what gifts shall i pursue thee <eos> what offerings bring , what treasures lay before thee <eos> when earth with all her floral train doth woo thee <eos> and all old poets and old songs adore thee <eos> and love to thee is naught ; from passionate mood <eos> secured by joy 's complacent plenitude <eos>

with clytia he no longer was received <eos> than while he was a man of wealth believed <eos> balls , concerts , op'ras , tournaments , and plays <eos> expensive dresses , all engaging ways <eos> were used to captivate this lady fair <eos> while scarcely one around but in despair <eos> wife , widow , maid , his fond affection sought <eos> to gain him , ev'ry wily art was brought <eos> but all in vain :— by passion overpow'red <eos> the belle , whose conduct others would have soured <eos> to him appeared a goddess full of charms <eos> superior e'en to helen , in his arms <eos> from whence we may conclude , the beauteous dame <eos> was always deaf to fred'rick ' s ardent flame <eos>
go thou into thy closet ; shut thy door <eos> and pray to him in secret : he will hear <eos> but think not thou , by one wild bound , to clear <eos> the numberless ascensions , more and more <eos> of starry stairs that must be climbed , before <eos> thou comest to the father 's likeness near <eos> and bendest down to kiss the feet so dear <eos> that , step by step , their mounting flights passed o'er <eos> be thou content if on thy weary need <eos> there falls a sense of showers and of the spring <eos> a hope that makes it possible to fling <eos> sickness aside , and go and do the deed <eos> for highest aspiration will not lead <eos> unto the calm beyond all questioning <eos>
one day the doctor found the bottle full <eos> and , being thirsty , took a vigorous pull <eos> put back the “ elixir ” where ‘ t was always found <eos> and had old dobbin saddled and brought round <eos> — you know those old time rhubarb colored nags <eos> that carried doctors and their saddle bags <eos> sagacious beasts ! they stopped at every place <eos> where blinds were shut — knew every patient 's case <eos> looked up and thought — the baby 's in a fit <eos> that wo n't last long — he 'll soon be through with it <eos> but shook their heads before the knockered door <eos> where some old lady told the story o'er <eos> whose endless stream of tribulation flows <eos> for gastric griefs and peristaltic woes <eos>

when to the public school compelled to go <eos> what novel scenes did on my senses flow <eos> there in each breast each active power dilates <eos> which ‘ broils whole nations , and convulses states <eos> their reigns , by turns alternate , love and hate <eos> ambition burns , and factious rebels prate <eos> and in a smaller range , a smaller sphere <eos> the dark deformities of man appear <eos> yet there the gentler virtues kindred claim <eos> there friendship lights her pure untainted flame <eos> there mild benevolence delights to dwell <eos> and sweet contentment rests without her cell <eos> and there , ‘ mid many a stormy soul , we find <eos> the good of heart , the intelligent of mind <eos>
and through the long , still nights this cry was hers <eos> as on her couch she lay till dreary dawn <eos> her large eyes dark with horror looking out <eos> upon the pitchy darkness unafraid <eos> and as the breathings of the new spring breeze <eos> soft sights of sad complaint , to autumn 's storms <eos> that hold the burdened sorrow of a year <eos> was this , her sigh of , “ oh , the happy world <eos> to this despairing cry of , “ oh , my heart <eos> and as the year 's late winds leave pale and chill <eos> the earth , so did this weary cry of hers <eos> so oft repeated leave her lips like snow <eos> and oft the lonely midnight heard her moan <eos> of hopes foregone , that women hold most dear <eos>
some infidel , i fancy , in my ear <eos> would whisper probabilities , i fear <eos> are rather wanting to support the fact <eos> however perfectly gallants may act <eos> to gain a heart requires full many a day <eos> if more be requisite i cannot say <eos> ‘ tis not my plan to dupe or young or old <eos> but such to me , howe'er the tale is told <eos> and ariosto never truth forsakes <eos> yet , if at ev'ry step a writer takes <eos> he 's closely question 'd as to time and place <eos> he ne'er can end his work with easy grace <eos> to those , from whom just credence i receive <eos> their tales i promise fully to believe <eos>
‘ andromache ! my soul 's far better part <eos> why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart <eos> no hostile hand can antedate my doom <eos> till fate condemns me to the silent tomb <eos> fixed is the term to all the race of earth <eos> and such the hard condition of our birth <eos> no force can then resist , no flight can save <eos> all sink alike , the fearful and the brave <eos> no more — but hasten to thy tasks at home <eos> there guide the spindle , and direct the loom <eos> me glory summons to the martial scene <eos> the field of combat is the sphere for men <eos> where heroes war , the foremost place i claim <eos> the first in danger as the first in fame <eos>
the squire had wished his trusty man , no doubt <eos> had not , at cudgelling , been quite so stout <eos> but since he showed himself so true a friend <eos> and with his actions could such prudence blend <eos> the master fully pardoned what he knew <eos> and quickly to his wife in bed he flew <eos> when he related every thing that passed <eos> were we , cried he , a hundred years to last <eos> my lovely dear , we ne'er on earth could find <eos> a man so faithful , and so well inclined <eos> i 'd have him take within our town a wife <eos> and you and i 'll regard him during life <eos> in that , replied the lady , we agree <eos> and heartily thereto i pledged will be <eos>
here learning , too , shall rear unnumbered domes <eos> here shakspeares — tassos — find more happy homes <eos> here homer 's fire , and virgil 's polished grace <eos> a sacred charm shall give to many a place <eos> each shady hill shall be a muse 's haunt <eos> by each pure spring aerial nymphs shall chant <eos> chant the sweet song to heavenly liberty <eos> while thundering cataracts peal it to the sea <eos> she spake no more ;— or i too much opprest <eos> by wondrous visions , needed welcome rest <eos> and when i waked , the day had now unfurled <eos> his rosy banners o'er the laughing world <eos> and while the glorious prospect charmed my view <eos> i felt columbia 's prophecy was true <eos>
an arid daylight shines along the beach <eos> dried to a grey monotony of tone <eos> and stranded jelly fish melt soft upon <eos> the sun baked pebbles , far beyond their reach <eos> sparkles a wet , reviving sea . here bleach <eos> the skeletons of fishes , every bone <eos> polished and stark , like traceries of stone <eos> the joints and knuckles hardened each to each <eos> and they are dead while waiting for the sea <eos> the moon pursuing sea , to come again <eos> their hearts are blown away on the hot breeze <eos> only the shells and stones can wait to be <eos> washed bright . for living things , who suffer pain <eos> may not endure till time can bring them ease <eos>
there was a cry of terror in the hall <eos> of peru 's monarch , and a startling call <eos> but no reply — iola sure was gone <eos> yet none knew why or whither she had flown <eos> her inca father put his crown aside <eos> and filled the temple with loud prayer — a tide <eos> of lamentation rolled along the fair <eos> and blooming realm ; heaven wore a dim despair <eos> she ne'er was found ; but how or when she died <eos> none knew ; by her own hand ; or if she cried <eos> vainly , in wild beasts ’ clutch ;— but ne'er before <eos> din wail so wild resound along the shore <eos> of fair peru ; her father lived not long <eos> after this chord was snapped in his life 's song <eos>
this is the golden book of spirit and sense <eos> the holy writ of beauty ; he that wrought <eos> made it with dreams and faultless words and thought <eos> that seeks and finds and loses in the dense <eos> dim air of life that beauty 's excellence <eos> wherewith love makes one hour of life distraught <eos> and all hours after follow and find not aught <eos> here is that height of all love 's eminence <eos> where man may breathe but for a breathing space <eos> and feel his soul burn as an altar fire <eos> to the unknown god of unachieved desire <eos> and from the middle mystery of the place <eos> watch lights that break , hear sounds as of a quire <eos> but see not twice unveiled the veiled god 's face <eos>
but as thou earnest forth to bring the poor <eos> whose hearts were nearer faith and verity <eos> spiritual childhood , thy philosophy <eos> so taught'st the a , b , c of heavenly lore <eos> because thou sat'st not , lonely evermore <eos> with mighty thoughts informing language high <eos> but , walking in thy poem continually <eos> didst utter acts , of all true forms the core <eos> instead of parchment , writing on the soul <eos> high thoughts and aspirations , being so <eos> thine own ideal ; poet and poem , lo <eos> one indivisible ; thou didst reach thy goal <eos> triumphant , but with little of acclaim <eos> even from thine own , escaping not their blame <eos>
god made my lady lovely to behold <eos> above the painter 's dream he set her face <eos> and wrought her body in divinest grace <eos> he touched the brown hair with a sense of gold <eos> and in the perfect form he did enfold <eos> what was alone as perfect , the sweet heart <eos> knowledge most rare to her he did impart <eos> and filled with love and worship all her days <eos> and then god thought him how it would be well <eos> to give her music , and to love he said <eos> “ bring thou some minstrel now that he may tell <eos> how fair and sweet a thing my hands have made <eos> then at love 's call i came , bowed down my head <eos> and at his will my lyre grew audible <eos>
like as the seeded field greene grasse first showes <eos> then from greene grasse into a stalke doth spring <eos> and from a stalke into an eare forth growes <eos> which eare the frutefull graine doth shortly bring <eos> and as in season due the husband * mowes <eos> the waving lockes of those faire yeallow heares <eos> which , bound in sheaves , and layd in comely rowes <eos> upon the naked fields in stalkes he reares <eos> so grew the romane empire by degree <eos> till that barbarian hands it quite did spill <eos> and left of it but these olde markes to see <eos> of which all passers by doo somewhat pill <eos> as they which gleane , the reliques use to gather <eos> which th'husbandman behind him chanst to scater <eos>
aye , you may see their graves — you who have toiled <eos> and tripped and thirsted , like these men of ours <eos> for , verily , i say that not so deep <eos> their bones are that the scattered drift and dust <eos> of gusty days will never leave them bare <eos> o dear , dead , bleaching bones ! i know of those <eos> who have the wild , strong will to go and sit <eos> outside all things with you , and keep the ways <eos> aloof from bats , and snakes , and trampling feet <eos> that smite your peace and theirs — who have the heart <eos> without the lusty limbs , to face the fire <eos> and moonless midnights , and to be , indeed <eos> for very sorrow , like a moaning wind <eos> in wintry forests with perpetual rain <eos>
two voices are there ; one is of the sea <eos> one of the mountains ; each a mighty voice <eos> in both from age to age thou didst rejoice <eos> they were thy chosen music , liberty <eos> there came a tyrant , and with holy glee <eos> thou fought'st against him ; but hast vainly striven <eos> thou from thy alpine holds at length art driven <eos> where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee <eos> of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft <eos> then cleave , o cleave to that which still is left <eos> for , high soul 'd maid , what sorrow would it be <eos> that mountain floods should thunder as before <eos> and ocean bellow from his rocky shore <eos> and neither awful voice be heard by thee <eos>
the goddess answer 'd : “ father , i obey <eos> and point the wandering traveller his way <eos> well known to me the palace you inquire <eos> for fast beside it dwells my honour 'd sire <eos> but silent march , nor greet the common train <eos> with question needless , or inquiry vain <eos> a race of ragged mariners are these <eos> unpolish 'd men , and boisterous as their seas <eos> the native islanders alone their care <eos> and hateful he who breathes a foreign air <eos> these did the ruler of the deep ordain <eos> to build proud navies , and command the main <eos> on canvas wings to cut the watery way <eos> no bird so light , no thought so swift as they <eos>
the city slept beneath the moonbeam 's glance <eos> her white walls gleaming through the vines of france <eos> and all was hushed , save where the footsteps fell <eos> on some high tower , of midnight sentinel <eos> but one still watched ; no self encircled woes <eos> chased from his lids the angel of repose <eos> he watched , he wept , for thoughts of bitter years <eos> bowed his dark lashes , wet with burning tears <eos> his country 's sufferings and her children 's shame <eos> streamed o'er his memory like a forest 's flame <eos> each treasured insult , each remembered wrong <eos> rolled through his heart and kindled into song <eos> his taper faded ; and the morning gales <eos> swept through the world the war song of marseilles <eos>
the sister nuns so vigilant had been <eos> one night when darkness overspread the scene <eos> and all was proper mysteries to hide <eos> some words escaped her cell that doubts supplied <eos> and other matters too were heard around <eos> that in her breviary could not be found <eos> ‘ tis her gallant ! said they : he 's clearly caught <eos> alarm pervaded ; swarms were quickly brought <eos> rage seemed to triumph ; sentinels were placed <eos> the abbess too must know they were disgraced <eos> away they hastened to convey surprise <eos> and , thund'ring at her door , cried , madam rise <eos> for sister isabella , in her cell <eos> has got a man , which surely can n't be well <eos>
“ ‘ close by , a rock of less enormous height <eos> breaks the wild waves , and forms a dangerous strait <eos> full on its crown a fig 's green branches rise <eos> and shoot a leafy forest to the skies <eos> beneath , charybdis holds her boisterous reign <eos> ‘ midst roaring whirlpools , and absorbs the main <eos> thrice in her gulfs the boiling seas subside <eos> thrice in dire thunders she refunds the tide <eos> oh , if thy vessel plough the direful waves <eos> when seas retreating roar within her caves <eos> ye perish all ! though he who rules the main <eos> lends his strong aid , his aid he lends in vain <eos> ah , shun the horrid gulf ! by scylla fly <eos> ‘ tis better six to lose , than all to die <eos>
her gay descent the man perceived afar <eos> wondering he ran to catch the falling star <eos> but so surprised , as none but he can tell <eos> who loved so quickly , and who loved so well <eos> o'er all his veins the wandering passion burns <eos> he calls her nymph , and every nymph by turns <eos> her form to lovely venus he prefers <eos> or swears that venus must be such as hers <eos> she , proud to rule , yet strangely framed to tease <eos> neglects his offers while her airs she plays <eos> shoots scornful glances from the bended frown <eos> in brisk disorder trips it up and down <eos> then hums a careless tune to lay the storm <eos> and sits and blushes , smiles , and yields in form <eos>
but be contented when that fell arrest <eos> without all bail shall carry me away <eos> my life hath in this line some interest <eos> which for memorial still with thee shall stay <eos> when thou reviewest this , thou dost review <eos> the very part was consecrate to thee <eos> the earth can have but earth , which is his due <eos> my spirit is thine the better part of me <eos> so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life <eos> the prey of worms , my body being dead <eos> the coward conquest of a wretch 's knife <eos> too base of thee to be remembered <eos> the worth of that , is that which it contains <eos> and that is this , and this with thee remains <eos>
“ hear me , ye countless tribes , that dwelling round <eos> assist our cause ! you from your sev'ral homes <eos> not for display of numbers have i call 'd <eos> but that with willing hearts ye should defend <eos> our wives and infants from the warlike greeks <eos> for this i drain my people 's stores , for food <eos> and gifts for you , exalting your estate <eos> then , who will boldly onward , he may fall <eos> or safe escape , such is the chance of war <eos> but who within our valiant trojans ’ ranks <eos> shall but the body of patroclus bring <eos> despite the might of ajax ; half the spoils <eos> to him i give , the other half myself <eos> retaining ; and his praise shall equal mine <eos>

oh , cruel liquor ! thou hast millions slain <eos> and still their death throes cry to thee in vain <eos> ten thousand broken hearts may soon be found <eos> in almost every land the world around <eos> millions of orphans ’ cries thine ears assail <eos> while parents ’ early death they loud bewail <eos> the prisons and asylums which we build <eos> from thy sad victims ’ ranks are chiefly filled <eos> war 's dreadful ravages are justly blamed <eos> but war with thee deserves not to be named <eos> and still , insatiate monster ! thy dread jaws <eos> are daily filled — being unrestrained by laws <eos> when will the day , the happy day , arrive <eos> when thee the injured nations forth shall drive <eos>
nor can i not believe but that hereby <eos> great gains are mine : for thus i live remote <eos> from evil speaking ; rancour , never sought <eos> comes to me not ; malignant truth , or lie <eos> hence have i genial seasons , hence have i <eos> smooth passions , smooth discourse , and joyous thought <eos> and thus from day to day my little boat <eos> rocks in its harbour , lodging peaceably <eos> blessings be with them , and eternal praise <eos> who gave us nobler loves , and nobler cares <eos> the poets , who on earth have made us heirs <eos> of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays <eos> oh ! might my name be numbered among theirs <eos> then gladly would i end my mortal days <eos>
in vain he sigh 'd , and oft with tears desired <eos> some reasonable suit might be required <eos> but still the crone was constant to her note <eos> the more he spoke , the more she stretch 'd her throat <eos> in vain he proffer 'd all his goods , to save <eos> his body destined to that living grave <eos> the liquorish hag rejects the pelf with scorn <eos> and nothing but the man would serve her turn <eos> not all the wealth of eastern kings , said she <eos> have power to part my plighted love , and me <eos> and , old and ugly as i am , and poor <eos> yet never will i break the faith i swore <eos> for mine thou art by promise , during life <eos> and i thy loving and obedient wife <eos>
“ mother , ” he said , “ thou askest no great thing <eos> some wretch too bad for death i soon shall find <eos> who round her perfect neck his arms shall wind <eos> she shall be driven from the palace gate <eos> where once her crowd of worshippers would wait <eos> from earliest morning till the dew was dry <eos> on chance of seeing her gold gown glancing by <eos> there through the storm of curses shall she go <eos> in evil raiment midst the winter snow <eos> or in the summer in rough sheepskins clad <eos> and thus , o mother , shall i make thee glad <eos> remembering all the honour thou hast brought <eos> unto mine altars ; since as thine own thought <eos> my thought is grown , my mind as thy dear mind <eos>

take of the first fruits , father , of thy care <eos> wrapped in the fresh leaves of my gratitude <eos> late waked for early gifts ill understood <eos> claiming in all my harvests rightful share <eos> whether with song that mounts the joyful air <eos> i praise my god , or , in yet deeper mood <eos> sit dumb because i know a speechless good <eos> needing no voice , but all the soul for prayer <eos> thou hast been faithful to my highest need <eos> and i , thy debtor , ever , evermore <eos> shall never feel the grateful burden sore <eos> yet most i thank thee , not for any deed <eos> but for the sense thy living self did breed <eos> of fatherhood still at the great world 's core <eos>
in heaven was dole among the immortal ones <eos> even all that helped the stalwart danaans ’ cause <eos> in clouds like mountains piled they veiled their heads <eos> for grief of soul . but glad those others were <eos> who fain would speed troy to a happy goal <eos> then unto cronos ’ son great hera spake <eos> “ zeus , lightning father , wherefore helpest thou <eos> troy , all forgetful of the fair haired bride <eos> whom once to peleus thou didst give to wife <eos> midst pelion 's glens ? thyself didst bring to pass <eos> those spousals of a goddess : on that day <eos> all we immortals feasted there , and gave <eos> gifts passing fair . all this dost thou forget <eos> and hast devised for hellas heaviest woe <eos>
i reached the alps : the soul within me burned <eos> italia , my italia , at thy name <eos> and when from out the mountain 's heart i came <eos> and saw the land for which my life had yearned <eos> i laughed as one who some great prize had earned <eos> and musing on the marvel of thy fame <eos> i watched the day , till marked with wounds of flame <eos> the turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned <eos> the pine trees waved as waves a woman 's hair <eos> and in the orchards every twining spray <eos> was breaking into flakes of blossoming foam <eos> but when i knew that far away at rome <eos> in evil bonds a second peter lay <eos> i wept to see the land so very fair <eos>
disciple of the bright aonian maid <eos> in thy life 's blossom , a resistless spell <eos> amid the wild wood , and irriguous dell <eos> o'er thymy hill , and thro ’ illumin 'd glade <eos> led thee , for her thy votive wreaths to braid <eos> where flaunts the musk rose , and the azure bell <eos> nods o'er loquacious brook , or silent well <eos> thus woo 'd her inspirations , their rapt aid <eos> liberal she gave ; nor only thro ’ thy strain <eos> breath 'd their pure spirit , while her charms beguil 'd <eos> the languid hours of sorrow , and of pain <eos> but when youth 's tide ran high , and tempting smil 'd <eos> circean pleasure , rescuing did she stand <eos> broke the enchantress ’ cup and snapt her wand <eos>
hearkening to her they called their sire to mind <eos> his deeds for helen 's sake , and how the sons <eos> of zeus the thunderer in the old time smote <eos> aphidnae , when , because these were but babes <eos> their nurses hid them far from peril of fight <eos> and aethra they remembered — all she endured <eos> through wars , as mother in law at first , and thrall <eos> thereafter of helen . dumb for joy were they <eos> till spake demophoon to that wistful one <eos> “ even now the gods fulfil thine heart 's desire <eos> we whom thou seest are the sons of him <eos> thy noble son : thee shall our loving hands <eos> bear to the ships : with joy to hellas ’ soil <eos> thee will we bring , where once thou wast a queen <eos>
seeker of truth !— long hast thou striven to find <eos> this only boon that satisfies the mind <eos> through nature 's stores the treasure hast thou sought <eos> hast traversed all the boundless fields of thought <eos> questioned the lonely night , the laughing day <eos> the ocean depths , the founts that ceaseless play <eos> old hoary mountains , cliffs , and caverns lone <eos> earth 's secret depths — mysterious , unknown <eos> asked of the past , the present , future , striven <eos> to pierce the mysteries unrevealed of heaven <eos> yet weary and unsatisfied remained <eos> longing for truth , still far off , unattained <eos> that truth which satisfies the anxious quest <eos> and with the attainment , bringeth perfect rest <eos>

i go from colonnade to colonnade <eos> in streets that dante trod , and past the towers <eos> aslant toward heaven , and listen to the hours <eos> chimed by the bells of choirs where dante prayed <eos> they cease ; then lo ! the foot of time seems stayed <eos> five hundred years and more , i find me bowers <eos> where sweet and noble ladies weave them flowers <eos> for one who reads boccaccio in the shade <eos> the cowl è d students halt by two and threes <eos> to hear the voice come thrilling through the trees <eos> then tear themselves away to themes more trite <eos> anon i mark the diligent hands that turn <eos> unlovely parchment scrolls whereby to learn <eos> the beauty of inexorable right <eos>
the kind instructor in these words began <eos> “ ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now <eos> i ’ th ’ second round , and shalt be , till thou come <eos> upon the horrid sand : look therefore well <eos> around thee , and such things thou shalt behold <eos> as would my speech discredit . ” on all sides <eos> i heard sad plainings breathe , and none could see <eos> from whom they might have issu 'd . in amaze <eos> fast bound i stood . he , as it seem 'd , believ 'd <eos> that i had thought so many voices came <eos> from some amid those thickets close conceal 'd <eos> and thus his speech resum 'd : “ if thou lop off <eos> a single twig from one of those ill plants <eos> the thought thou hast conceiv 'd shall vanish quite <eos>
“ all selfishness ! ” cried linda ; “ selfishness <eos> i seek my happiness , and others theirs <eos> only my tastes are different ; more plebeian <eos> haply , they 'd say ; but , husband mine , reflect <eos> you , too , i fear , are lacking in refinement <eos> would this have been , had you not acquiesced <eos> in all these vulgar freaks , and found content <eos> like me , in giving pleasure to the needy <eos> and tell me — passing to another point <eos> where would have been the monarch of this joy <eos> that little child ,— that antepast of bliss <eos> such as the angels taste ,— had i recoiled <eos> from daring as i did , even when i knew <eos> he i most wished to win would think me bold <eos>
“ such are the men who , with instinctive dread <eos> whenever freedom lifts her drooping head <eos> make prophet tripods of their office stools <eos> and scare the nurseries and the village schools <eos> with dire presage of ruin grim and great <eos> a broken union and a foundered state <eos> such are the patriots , self bound to the stake <eos> of office , martyrs for their country 's sake <eos> who fill themselves the hungry jaws of fate <eos> and by their loss of manhood save the state <eos> in the wide gulf themselves like cortius throw <eos> and test the virtues of cohesive dough <eos> as tropic monkeys , linking heads and tails <eos> bridge o'er some torrent of ecuador 's vales <eos>
when my love swears that she is made of truth <eos> i do believe her though i know she lies <eos> that she might think me some untutored youth <eos> unlearned in the world 's false subtleties <eos> thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young <eos> although she knows my days are past the best <eos> simply i credit her false speaking tongue <eos> on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed <eos> but wherefore says she not she is unjust <eos> and wherefore say not i that i am old <eos> o love 's best habit is in seeming trust <eos> and age in love , loves not to have years told <eos> therefore i lie with her , and she with me <eos> and in our faults by lies we flattered be <eos>
i know , indeed , that sons of thine have died <eos> in lissa 's waters , by the mountain side <eos> of aspromonte , on novara 's plain <eos> nor have thy children died for thee in vain <eos> and yet , methinks , thou hast not drunk this wine <eos> from grapes new crushed of liberty divine <eos> thou hast not followed that immortal star <eos> which leads the people forth to deeds of war <eos> weary of life , thou liest in silent sleep <eos> as one who marks the lengthening shadows creep <eos> careless of all the hurrying hours that run <eos> mourning some day of glory , for the sun <eos> of freedom hath not shewn to thee his face <eos> and thou hast caught no flambeau in the race <eos>
a satyr spied a goddess in her bath <eos> unseen of her attendant nymphs ; none knew <eos> forthwith the creature to his fellows drew <eos> and looking backward on the curtained path <eos> he strove to tell ; he could but heave a breast <eos> too full , and point to mouth , with failing leers <eos> vainly he danced for speech , he giggled tears <eos> made as if torn in two , as if tight pressed <eos> as if cast prone ; then fetching whimpered tunes <eos> for words , flung heel and set his hairy flight <eos> through forest hollows , over rocky height <eos> the green leaves buried him three rounds of moons <eos> a senatorial satyr named what herb <eos> had hurried him outrunning reason 's curb <eos>
giddings , far rougher names than thine have grown <eos> smoother than honey on the lips of men <eos> and thou shalt aye be honorably known <eos> as one who bravely used his tongue and pen <eos> as best befits a freeman ,— even for those <eos> to whom our law 's unblushing front denies <eos> a right to plead against the lifelong woes <eos> which are the negro 's glimpse of freedom 's skies <eos> fear nothing , and hope all things , as the right <eos> alone may do securely ; every hour <eos> the thrones of ignorance and ancient night <eos> lose somewhat of their long usurp è d power <eos> and freedom 's lightest word can make them shiver <eos> with a base dread that clings to them forever <eos>
rare is the loveliness of slow decay <eos> with youth and beauty all must be desired <eos> but ‘ tis the charm of things long past away <eos> they leave , alone , the light they have inspired <eos> the calmness of a picture ; memory now <eos> is the sole life among the ruins grey <eos> and like a phantom in fantastic play <eos> she wanders with rank weeds stuck on her brow <eos> over grass hidden caves and turret tops <eos> herself almost as tottering as they <eos> while , to the steps of time , her latest props <eos> fall stone by stone , and in the sun 's hot ray <eos> all that remains stands up in rugged pride <eos> and bridal vines drink in his juices on each side <eos>
sweet spirits of the beautiful ! where'er ye dwell <eos> whether upon the misty mountain tops <eos> with mantling crags about ye , or in dell <eos> and sunny valley , by the hazel copse <eos> wherein the ring dove nestles , or by streams <eos> that wander amid woodlands , with the sheen <eos> of noontide trembling through the leafy screen <eos> down to their mossy banks in fitful gleams <eos> that murmur with the linnets and at e'en <eos> sigh with the plaintive nightingale , and oft <eos> mirror your bright eyes in the sparkling dew <eos> circle me ever with your joyous crew <eos> bring inspirations to me bland and soft <eos> and sun my slumbers still with happy dreams <eos>
well , when in summer afternoons you see <eos> men fain to listen , tell them about me <eos> tell them that , born a freedman 's son , possessed <eos> of slender means , i soared beyond my nest <eos> that so whate'er ' s deducted for my birth <eos> may count as assets on the score of worth <eos> say that i pleased the greatest of my day <eos> then draw my picture ;— prematurely grey <eos> of little person , fond of sunny ease <eos> lightly provoked , but easy to appease <eos> last , if my age they ask you , let them know <eos> that i was forty four not long ago <eos> in the december of last year , the same <eos> that goes by lepidus ’ and lollius ’ name <eos>
“ o plant ! from whence i spring ! rever 'd and lov 'd <eos> who soar'st so high a pitch , thou seest as clear <eos> as earthly thought determines two obtuse <eos> in one triangle not contain 'd , so clear <eos> dost see contingencies , ere in themselves <eos> existent , looking at the point whereto <eos> all times are present , i , the whilst i scal 'd <eos> with virgil the soul purifying mount <eos> and visited the nether world of woe <eos> touching my future destiny have heard <eos> words grievous , though i feel me on all sides <eos> well squar 'd to fortune 's blows . therefore my will <eos> were satisfied to know the lot awaits me <eos> the arrow , seen beforehand , slacks its flight <eos>
of all the causes which conspire to blind <eos> man 's erring judgment , and misguide the mind <eos> what the weak head with strongest bias rules <eos> is pride , the never failing voice of fools <eos> whatever nature has in worth denied <eos> she gives in large recruits of needful pride <eos> for as in bodies , thus in souls , we find <eos> what wants in blood and spirits , swell 'd with wind <eos> pride , where wit fails , steps in to our defence <eos> and fills up all the mighty void of sense <eos> if once right reason drives that cloud away <eos> truth breaks upon us with resistless day <eos> trust not yourself ; but your defects to know <eos> make use of ev'ry friend — and ev'ry foe <eos>
haunted of beauty , like the marvellous youth <eos> who sang saint agnes ’ eve ! how passing fair <eos> her shapes took color in thy homestead air <eos> how on thy canvas even her dreams were truth <eos> magician ! who from commonest elements <eos> called up divine ideals , clothed upon <eos> by mystic lights soft blending into one <eos> womanly grace and child like innocence <eos> teacher i thy lesson was not given in vain <eos> beauty is goodness ; ugliness is sin <eos> art 's place is sacred : nothing foul therein <eos> may crawl or tread with bestial feet profane <eos> if rightly choosing is the painter 's test <eos> thy choice , o master , ever was the best <eos>
man rising to the doom that shall not err <eos> which hath most dread : the arouse of all or each <eos> all kindreds of all nations of all speech <eos> or one by one of him and him and her <eos> while dust reanimate begins to stir <eos> here , there , beyond , beyond , reach beyond reach <eos> while every wave refashions on the beach <eos> alive or dead in life some seafarer <eos> now meeting doth not join or parting part <eos> true meeting and true parting wait till then <eos> when whoso meet are joined for evermore <eos> face answering face and heart at rest in heart <eos> god bring us all rejoicing to the shore <eos> of happy heaven , his sheep home to the pen <eos>
said he , we now are in a place retired <eos> unknown to man , ( such spots how oft desired <eos> let 's take advantage of the present hour <eos> no joys , but those of love , are in our pow'r <eos> all others see withdrawn ! and no one knows <eos> we even live ; perhaps both friends and foes <eos> believe us in the belly of a whale <eos> allow me , lovely princess , to prevail <eos> bestow your kindness , or , without delay <eos> those charms to mamolin let me convey <eos> yet , why go thither ?— happy you could make <eos> the man , whose constancy no perils shake <eos> what would you more ?— his passion 's ardent grown <eos> and surely you 've enough resistance shown <eos>
alas ! we poured into the wavy sea <eos> the strength of our two founts in vain <eos> for two opposing powers hold it concealed <eos> lest it go rolling aimlessly adown <eos> the strength unmeasured of the burning heart <eos> withholds a passage to the lofty streams <eos> barring their twofold course unto the sea <eos> nature abhors the covered ground . [ w <eos> now say , afflicted heart , what canst thou bring <eos> to oppose against us with an equal force <eos> oh , where is he , will boast himself to be <eos> exalted by this most unhappy love <eos> if of thy pain and mine it can be said <eos> the greater they , the less it may be seen <eos>
then blushed and brake the morning of the jousts <eos> and this was called ‘ the tournament of youth <eos> for arthur , loving his young knight , withheld <eos> his older and his mightier from the lists <eos> that pelleas might obtain his lady 's love <eos> according to her promise , and remain <eos> lord of the tourney . and arthur had the jousts <eos> down in the flat field by the shore of usk <eos> holden : the gilded parapets were crowned <eos> with faces , and the great tower filled with eyes <eos> up to the summit , and the trumpets blew <eos> there all day long sir pelleas kept the field <eos> with honour : so by that strong hand of his <eos> the sword and golden circlet were achieved <eos>
wilt thou love god as he thee ? then digest <eos> my soul ! this wholesome meditation <eos> how god the spirit , by angels waited on <eos> in heaven , doth make his temple in thy breast <eos> the father having begot a son most blest <eos> and still begetting , ( for he ne'er begun <eos> hath deigned to choose thee by adoption <eos> co heir to his glory , and sabbath 's endless rest <eos> and as a robbed man , which by search doth find <eos> his stol'n stuff sold , must lose or buy ‘ t again <eos> the sun of glory came down and was slain <eos> us , whom he had made , and satan stole , to unbind <eos> ‘ twas much that man was made like god before <eos> but that god should be made like man much more <eos>

nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance <eos> to watch the gate was warlike nisus ’ chance <eos> his father hyrtacus of noble blood <eos> his mother was a huntress of the wood <eos> and sent him to the wars . well could he bear <eos> his lance in fight , and dart the flying spear <eos> but better skill 'd unerring shafts to send <eos> beside him stood euryalus , his friend <eos> euryalus , than whom the trojan host <eos> no fairer face , or sweeter air , could boast  <eos> scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun <eos> one was their care , and their delight was one <eos> one common hazard in the war they shar 'd <eos> and now were both by choice upon the guard <eos>
look , when the rose to deep vermilion hue <eos> adds that sweet odour gracious nature gives <eos> when his proud glory gladdens every view <eos> and no base worm within his beauties lives <eos> we nothing question of what sex it be <eos> nor ask more of it than that it should lend <eos> his lovely gaze for ravish 'd eye to see <eos> and on the blessed air his fragrance spend <eos> we ask not that the star which lights the heaven <eos> should be or male or female to our sense <eos> suffic 'd in this , that it empearls the even <eos> and happies all our under reverence <eos> then might'st not thou , who wert both rose and star <eos> be pure to me as these to others are <eos>

when i consider life and its few years <eos> a wisp of fog betwixt us and the sun <eos> a call to battle , and the battle done <eos> ere the last echo dies within our ears <eos> a rose choked in the grass ; an hour of fears <eos> the gusts that past a darkening shore do beat <eos> the burst of music down an unlistening street <eos> i wonder at the idleness of tears <eos> ye old , old dead , and ye of yesternight <eos> chieftains , and bards , and keepers of the sheep <eos> by every cup of sorrow that you had <eos> loose me from tears , and make me see aright <eos> how each hath back what once he stayed to weep <eos> homer his sight , david his little lad <eos>
with careful step to keep his balance up <eos> he reels on warily along the street <eos> slabbering at mouth and with a staggering stoop <eos> mutters an angry look at all he meets <eos> bumptious and vain and proud he shoulders up <eos> and would be something if he knew but how <eos> to any man on earth he will not stoop <eos> but cracks of work , of horses and of plough <eos> proud of the foolish talk , the ale he quaffs <eos> he never heeds the insult loud that laughs <eos> with rosy maid he tries to joke and play <eos> who shrugs and nettles deep his pomp and pride <eos> and calls him “ drunken beast ” and runs away <eos> king to himself and fool to all beside <eos>
so oft have i invoked thee for my muse <eos> and found such fair assistance in my verse <eos> as every alien pen hath got my use <eos> and under thee their poesy disperse <eos> thine eyes , that taught the dumb on high to sing <eos> and heavy ignorance aloft to fly <eos> have added feathers to the learned 's wing <eos> and given grace a double majesty <eos> yet be most proud of that which i compile <eos> whose influence is thine , and born of thee <eos> in others ’ works thou dost but mend the style <eos> and arts with thy sweet graces graced be <eos> but thou art all my art , and dost advance <eos> as high as learning , my rude ignorance <eos>

i served my sentence — a bitter pill <eos> some fellows should take who never will <eos> and then i decided to go “ out west <eos> concludin ’ ‘ twould suit my health the best <eos> where , how i prospered , i never could tell <eos> but fortune seemed to like me well <eos> an ’ somehow every vein i struck <eos> was always bubbling over with luck <eos> an ’ better than that , i was steady an ’ true <eos> an ’ put my good resolutions through <eos> but i wrote to a trusty old neighbour , an ’ said <eos> “ you tell ‘ em , old fellow , that i am dead <eos> an ’ died a christian ; ‘ twill please ‘ em more <eos> than if i had lived the same as before <eos>
“ ‘ tis now the dead of night , ” and i will go <eos> to where the brook soft murmuring glides along <eos> in the still wood ; yet does the plaintive song <eos> of philomela through the welkin flow <eos> and while pale cynthia carelessly doth throw <eos> her dewy beams the verdant boughs among <eos> will sit beneath some spreading oak tree strong <eos> and intermingle with the streams my woe <eos> hush 'd in deep silence every gentle breeze <eos> no mortal breath disturbs the awful gloom <eos> cold , chilling dewdrops trickle down the trees <eos> and every flower withholds its rich perfume <eos> ‘ tis sorrow leads me to that sacred ground <eos> where henry moulders in a sleep profound <eos>
strong son of fergus , with thy latest breath <eos> thou hast lent a joy unto the funeral knell <eos> welcoming with thy whispered “ all is well <eos> the awful aspect of the angel death <eos> as , strong in life , thou couldst not brook to shun <eos> the heat and burthen of the fiery day <eos> fronting defeat with stalwart undismay <eos> and wearing meekly honours stoutly won <eos> pure lips , pure hands , pure heart were thine , as aye <eos> erin demanded from her bards of old <eos> and , therefore , on thy harpstrings of pure gold <eos> has waked once more her high heroic lay <eos> what shoulders now shall match the mighty fold <eos> of ossian 's mantle ? thou hast passed away <eos>
not in our dreams , not even in our dreams <eos> may we return to that sweet land of youth <eos> that home of hope , of innocence , and truth <eos> which as we farther roam but fairer seems <eos> in that dim shadowy world , where the soul strays <eos> when she has laid her mortal charge to rest <eos> we oft behold far future hours and days <eos> but ne'er live o'er the past , the happiest <eos> how oft will fancy 's wild imaginings <eos> bear us in sleep to times and worlds unseen <eos> but ah ! not e'en unfettered fancy 's wings <eos> can lead us back to aught that we have been <eos> or waft us to that smiling , sunny shore <eos> which e'en in slumber we may tread no more <eos>
against that time ( if ever that time come <eos> when i shall see thee frown on my defects <eos> when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum <eos> called to that audit by advised respects <eos> against that time when thou shalt strangely pass <eos> and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye <eos> when love converted from the thing it was <eos> shall reasons find of settled gravity <eos> against that time do i ensconce me here <eos> within the knowledge of mine own desert <eos> and this my hand , against my self uprear <eos> to guard the lawful reasons on thy part <eos> to leave poor me , thou hast the strength of laws <eos> since why to love , i can allege no cause <eos>
to know thee is all wisdom , and old age <eos> is but to know thee : dimly we behold thee <eos> athwart the veils of evil which enfold thee <eos> we beat upon our aching hearts with rage <eos> we cry for thee : we deem the world thy tomb <eos> as dwellers in lone planets look upon <eos> the mighty disk of their majestic sun <eos> hallowed in awful chasms of wheeling gloom <eos> making their day dim , so we gaze on thee <eos> come , thou of many crowns , white rob è d love <eos> oh ! rend the veil in twain : all men adore thee <eos> heaven crieth after thee ; earth waileth for thee <eos> breathe on thy wing è d throne , and it shall move <eos> in music and in light o'er land and sea <eos>

happy the first of men , ere yet confined <eos> to smoky cities ; who in sheltering groves <eos> warm caves , and deep sunk valleys lived and loved <eos> by cares unwounded ; what the sun and showers <eos> and genial earth untillaged , could produce <eos> they gathered grateful , or the acorn brown <eos> or blushing berry ; by the liquid lapse <eos> of murmuring waters called to slake their thirst <eos> or with fair nymphs their sun brown limbs to bathe <eos> with nymphs who fondly clasped their favourite youths <eos> unawed by shame , beneath the beechen shade <eos> nor wiles nor artificial coyness knew <eos> then doors and walls were not ; the melting maid <eos> nor frown of parents feared , nor husband 's threats <eos>

against my love shall be as i am now <eos> with time 's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn <eos> when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow <eos> with lines and wrinkles , when his youthful morn <eos> hath travelled on to age 's steepy night <eos> and all those beauties whereof now he 's king <eos> are vanishing , or vanished out of sight <eos> stealing away the treasure of his spring <eos> for such a time do i now fortify <eos> against confounding age 's cruel knife <eos> that he shall never cut from memory <eos> my sweet love 's beauty , though my lover 's life <eos> his beauty shall in these black lines be seen <eos> and they shall live , and he in them still green <eos>

o gracious mother , whose benignant breast <eos> wakes us to life , and lulls us all to rest <eos> how thy sweet features , kind to every clime <eos> mock with their smile the wrinkled front of time <eos> we stain thy flowers ,— they blossom o'er the dead <eos> we rend thy bosom , and it gives us bread <eos> o'er the red field that trampling strife has torn <eos> waves the green plumage of thy tasselled corn <eos> our maddening conflicts sear thy fairest plain <eos> still thy soft answer is the growing grain <eos> yet , o our mother , while uncounted charms <eos> steal round our hearts in thine embracing arms <eos> let not our virtues in thy love decay <eos> and thy fond sweetness waste our strength away <eos>
how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame <eos> which like a canker in the fragrant rose <eos> doth spot the beauty of thy budding name <eos> o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose <eos> that tongue that tells the story of thy days <eos> ( making lascivious comments on thy sport <eos> cannot dispraise , but in a kind of praise <eos> naming thy name , blesses an ill report <eos> o what a mansion have those vices got <eos> which for their habitation chose out thee <eos> where beauty 's veil doth cover every blot <eos> and all things turns to fair , that eyes can see <eos> take heed ( dear heart ) of this large privilege <eos> the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge <eos>
sierra 's poet ! high and pure thy muse <eos> enthroned doth sit amongst the stars and snows <eos> and from thy harp olympian music flows <eos> of glacier heights and gleaming mountain dews <eos> of western sea and burning sunset hues <eos> and we who look up — who on the plain repose <eos> and catch faint glimpses of the mount that throws <eos> athwart thy poet sight diviner views <eos> and not alone from starry shrine is strung <eos> thy lyre , but timed to gentler lay <eos> that sings of children , motherhood and home <eos> and lifts our hearts and lives to sweeter day <eos> oh , bard of nature 's heart ! thy name will rest <eos> immortal in thy land — our golden west <eos>
he said , and with the pliant lash he touch 'd <eos> the sleek skinn 'd horses ; springing at the sound <eos> between the greeks and trojans , light they bore <eos> the flying car , o'er bodies of the slain <eos> and broken bucklers trampling ; all beneath <eos> was plash 'd with blood the axle , and the rails <eos> around the car , as from the horses ’ feet <eos> and from the felloes of the wheels , were thrown <eos> the bloody gouts ; yet on he sped , to join <eos> the strife of men , and break th ’ opposing ranks <eos> his coming spread confusion ‘ mid the greeks <eos> his spear awhile withheld ; then through the rest <eos> with sword , and spear , and pond'rous stones he rush 'd <eos> but shunn 'd the might of ajax telamon <eos>
fayre ye be sure , but cruell and unkind <eos> as is a tygre , that with greedinesse <eos> hunts after bloud ; when he by chance doth find <eos> a feeble beast , doth felly him oppresse <eos> fayre be ye sure , but proud and pitilesse <eos> as is a storme , that all things doth prostrate <eos> finding a tree alone all comfortlesse <eos> beats on it strongly , it to ruinate <eos> fayre be ye sure , but hard and obstinate <eos> as is a rocke amidst the raging floods <eos> gaynst which a ship , of succour desolate <eos> doth suffer wreck both of her selfe and goods <eos> that ship , that tree , and that same beast , am i <eos> whom ye doe wreck , doe ruine , and destroy <eos>
i shall forget you presently , my dear <eos> so make the most of this , your little day <eos> your little month , your little half a year <eos> ere i forget , or die , or move away <eos> and we are done forever ; by and by <eos> i shall forget you , as i said , but now <eos> if you entreat me with your loveliest lie <eos> i will protest you with my favorite vow <eos> i would indeed that love were longer lived <eos> and oaths were not so brittle as they are <eos> but so it is , and nature has contrived <eos> to struggle on without a break thus far <eos> whether or not we find what we are seeking <eos> is idle , biologically speaking <eos>
the thridde day , this marchant up aryseth <eos> and on his nedes sadly him avyseth <eos> and up in to his countour hous goth he <eos> to rekene with him self , as wel may be <eos> of thilke yeer , how that it with him stood <eos> and how that he despended hadde his good <eos> and if that he encressed were or noon <eos> his bokes and his bagges many oon <eos> he leith biforn him on his counting bord <eos> ful riche was his tresor and his hord <eos> for which ful faste his countour dore he shette <eos> and eek he nolde that no man sholde him lette <eos> of his accountes , for the mene tyme <eos> and thus he sit til it was passed pryme <eos>
she turned away ; he turned again to sleep <eos> that no god troubled now , and , wondering <eos> what matters were afoot among the sidhe <eos> maeve walked through that great hall , and with a sigh <eos> lifted the curtain of her sleeping room <eos> remembering that she too had seemed divine <eos> to many thousand eyes , and to her own <eos> one that the generations had long waited <eos> that work too difficult for mortal hands <eos> might be accomplished . bunching the curtain up <eos> she saw her husband ailell sleeping there <eos> and thought of days when he 'd had a straight body <eos> and of that famous fergus , nessa 's husband <eos> who had been the lover of her middle life <eos>
men see their god , an immanence divine <eos> smile through the curve of flesh or moulded clay <eos> in bare ploughed lands that go sloping away <eos> to meet the sky in one clean exquisite line <eos> out of the short seen dawns of ecstasy <eos> they draw new beauty , whence new thoughts are born <eos> and in their turn conceive , as grains of corn <eos> germ and create new life and endlessly <eos> shall live creating . out of earthly seeds <eos> springs the aerial flower . one spirit proceeds <eos> through change , the same in body and in soul <eos> the spirit of life and love that triumphs still <eos> in its slow struggle towards some far off goal <eos> through lust and death and the bitterness of will <eos>
and now it would content me to yield up <eos> those lofty hopes awhile , for present gifts <eos> of humbler industry . but , oh , dear friend <eos> the poet , gentle creature as he is <eos> hath , like the lover , his unruly times <eos> his fits when he is neither sick nor well <eos> though no distress be near him but his own <eos> unmanageable thoughts : his mind , best pleased <eos> while she as duteous as the mother dove <eos> sits brooding , lives not always to that end <eos> but like the innocent bird , hath goadings on <eos> that drive her as in trouble through the groves ; [ l <eos> with me is now such passion , to be blamed <eos> no otherwise than as it lasts too long <eos>
spit in my face , you jews , and pierce my side <eos> buffet and scoff , scourge and crucify me <eos> for i have sinned , and sinned , and only he <eos> who could do no iniquity hath died <eos> but by my death cannot be satisfied <eos> my sins , which pass the jews ’ impiety <eos> they killed once an inglorious man , but i <eos> crucify him daily , being now glorified <eos> o let me then his strange love still admire <eos> kings pardon , but he bore our punishment <eos> and jacob came , clothed in vile harsh attire <eos> but to supplant , and with gainful intent <eos> god clothed himself in vile man 's flesh , that so <eos> he might be weak enough to surfer woe <eos>
ye too , dim watchfires of some darkling hour <eos> whose fame forlorn time saves not nor proclaims <eos> for ever , but forgetfulness defames <eos> and darkness and the shadow of death devour <eos> lift up ye too your light , put forth your power <eos> let the far twilight feel your soft small flames <eos> and smile , albeit night name not even their names <eos> ghost by ghost passing , flower blown down on flower <eos> that sweet tongued shadow , like a star 's that passed <eos> singing , and light was from its darkness cast <eos> to paint the face of painting fair with praise <eos> and that wherein forefigured smiles the pure <eos> fraternal face of wordsworth 's elidure <eos> between two child faced masks of merrier days <eos>
now powerful but inconstant in its course <eos> the tempest varies with uncertain force <eos> like doleful wailings on the lonely waste <eos> solemn and dreary sounds the weaning blast <eos> exhausted gusts recoiling growl away <eos> and , wak 'd anew , return with feebler sway <eos> save where between the ridgy mountains pent <eos> the fierce imprison 'd current strives for vent <eos> with hollow howl , and lamentation deep <eos> then rushes o'er the plain with partial sweep <eos> a parting gust o'erscours the weary land <eos> and lowly growls along the distant strand <eos> light thro ’ the wood the shiv'ring branches play <eos> and on the ocean far it slowly dies away <eos>
make me thy lyre , ev'n as the forest is <eos> what if my leaves are falling like its own <eos> the tumult of thy mighty harmonies <eos> will take from both a deep autumnal tone <eos> sweet though in sadness . be thou , spirit fierce <eos> my spirit ! be thou me , impetuous one <eos> drive my dead thoughts over the universe <eos> like wither 'd leaves to quicken a new birth <eos> and , by the incantation of this verse <eos> scatter , as from an unextinguish 'd hearth <eos> ashes and sparks , my words among mankind <eos> be through my lips to unawaken 'd earth <eos> the trumpet of a prophecy ! o , wind <eos> if winter comes , can spring be far behind <eos>
brave little people , of large aims , you bow <eos> too often , and too low before the past <eos> you sit too long in worship of the dead <eos> yet have you risen , open eyed , to greet <eos> the great material present . now salute <eos> the greater future , blazing its bold trail <eos> through old traditions . leave your dead to sleep <eos> in quiet peace with god . let your concern <eos> be with the living , and the yet unborn <eos> bestow on them your thoughts , and waste no time <eos> in costly honours to insensate dust <eos> unlock the doors of usefulness , and lead <eos> your lovely daughters forth to larger fields <eos> away from jungles of the ancient sin <eos>
these plaintive verse , the posts of my desire <eos> which haste for succour to her slow regard <eos> bear not report of any slender fire <eos> forging a grief to win a fame 's reward <eos> nor are my passions limned for outward hue <eos> for that no colours can depaint my sorrows <eos> delia herself , and all the world may view <eos> best in my face where cares have tilled deep furrows <eos> no bays i seek to deck my mourning brow <eos> o clear eyed rector of the holy hill <eos> my humble accents bear the olive bough <eos> of intercession but to move her will <eos> these lines i use t'unburden mine own heart <eos> my love affects no fame nor ‘ steems of art <eos>
the glorious image of the makers beautie <eos> my soverayne saynt , the idoll of my thought <eos> dare not henceforth , above the bounds of dewtie <eos> t'accuse of pride , or rashly blame for ought <eos> for being , as she is , divinely wrought <eos> and of the brood of angels heavenly born <eos> and with the crew of blessed saynts upbrought <eos> each of which did her with theyr guifts adorne <eos> the bud of ioy , the blossome of the morne <eos> the beame of light , whom mortal eyes admyre <eos> what reason is it then but she should scorne <eos> base things , that to her love too bold aspire <eos> such heavenly formes ought rather worshipt be <eos> then dare be lov 'd by men of meane degree <eos>
we soon approach 'd it . o thou lombard spirit <eos> how didst thou stand , in high abstracted mood <eos> scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes <eos> it spoke not aught , but let us onward pass <eos> eyeing us as a lion on his watch <eos> but virgil with entreaty mild advanc 'd <eos> requesting it to show the best ascent <eos> it answer to his question none return 'd <eos> but of our country and our kind of life <eos> demanded . when my courteous guide began <eos> “ mantua , ” the solitary shadow quick <eos> rose towards us from the place in which it stood <eos> and cry 'd , “ mantuan ! i am thy countryman <eos> sordello . ” each the other then embrac 'd <eos>
“ not all ” — the echoes answer me — “ not all <eos> “ prophetic sounds and loud , arise forever <eos> “ from us , and from all ruin , unto the wise <eos> “ as melody from memnon to the sun <eos> “ we rule the hearts of mightiest men — we rule <eos> “ with a despotic sway all giant minds <eos> “ we are not impotent — we pallid stones <eos> “ not all our power is gone — not all our fame <eos> “ not all the magic of our high renown <eos> “ not all the wonder that encircles us <eos> “ not all the mysteries that in us lie <eos> “ not all the memories that hang upon <eos> “ and cling around about us as a garment <eos> “ clothing us in a robe of more than glory <eos>
stay mee with saffron , underneath me set <eos> full banks of roses , beds of violet <eos> refresh mee with the choicest fruit , and spread <eos> the whitest lillies round about my head <eos> for the delay of the seene pow ’ re divine <eos> in sacred flames , consumes this breast of mine <eos> yee daughters of that holy citie , yee <eos> yee sisters ! i , ’ tis i , that humbly pray <eos> o , i , intreat you , by each hind , and roe <eos> that straying o ’ re the tops of hills doe goe <eos> yee stock of ancient isaac , yee that move <eos> with nimble foot through lebanus sweet grove <eos> o ’ re carmels fragrant top ! yee nymphs so faire <eos> the glory of the noble hills that are <eos>
the sister nuns so vigilant had been <eos> one night when darkness overspread the scene <eos> and all was proper mysteries to hide <eos> some words escaped her cell that doubts supplied <eos> and other matters too were heard around <eos> that in her breviary could not be found <eos> ‘ tis her gallant ! said they : he 's clearly caught <eos> alarm pervaded ; swarms were quickly brought <eos> rage seemed to triumph ; sentinels were placed <eos> the abbess too must know they were disgraced <eos> away they hastened to convey surprise <eos> and , thund'ring at her door , cried , madam rise <eos> for sister isabella , in her cell <eos> has got a man , which surely can n't be well <eos>
there was a touching paleness on her face <eos> which chased her smiles , but such sweet union made <eos> of pensive majesty and heavenly grace <eos> as if a passing cloud had veil 'd her with its shade <eos> then knew i how the blessed ones above <eos> gaze on each other in their perfect bliss <eos> for never yet was look of mortal love <eos> so pure , so tender , so serene as this <eos> the softest glance fond woman ever sent <eos> to him she loved , would cold and rayless be <eos> compared to this , which she divinely bent <eos> earthward , with angel sympathy , on me <eos> that seem 'd with speechless tenderness to say <eos> “ who takes from me my faithful friend away <eos>
my angel sister , tho ’ thy lovely form <eos> perish 'd in youth 's gay morning , yet is mine <eos> this precious ringlet !— still the soft hairs shine <eos> still glow the nut brown tints , all bright and warm <eos> with sunny gleam !— alas ! each kindred charm <eos> vanish 'd long since ; deep in the silent shrine <eos> wither 'd to shapeless dust !— and of their grace <eos> memory alone retains the faithful trace <eos> dear lock , had thy sweet owner liv 'd , ere now <eos> time on her brow had faded thee !— my care <eos> screen 'd from the sun and dew thy golden glow <eos> and thus her early beauty dost thou wear <eos> thou all of that fair frame my love cou 'd save <eos> from the resistless ravage of the grave <eos>
thus graced , thus glorified , shall shakspeare crave <eos> the sculptor 's skill , the pageant of the grave <eos> he needs it not — but gratitude demands <eos> this votive offering at his country 's hands <eos> haply , e'er now , from blissful bowers on high <eos> from some parnassus of the empyreal sky <eos> pleased , o'er this dome the gentle spirit bends <eos> accepts the gift , and hails us as his friends <eos> yet smiles , perchance , to think when envious time <eos> o'er bust and urn shall bid his ivies climb <eos> when palaces and pyramids shall fall <eos> his page shall triumph — still surviving all <eos> ‘ till earth itself , “ like breath upon the wind <eos> shall melt away , “ nor leave a rack behind <eos>
“ even in a palace , life may be led well <eos> so spoke the imperial sage , purest of men <eos> marcus aurelius . but the stifling den <eos> of common life , where , crowded up pell mell <eos> our freedom for a little bread we sell <eos> and drudge under some foolish master 's ken <eos> who rates us if we peer outside our pen <eos> matched with a palace , is not this a hell <eos> “ even in a palace ! ” on his truth sincere <eos> who spoke these words no shadow ever came <eos> and when my ill schooled spirit is aflame <eos> some nobler , ampler stage of life to win <eos> i 'll stop and say : “ there were no succor here <eos> the aids to noble life are all within <eos>
who lists to see what ever nature , arte <eos> and heaven could doo , o rome , thee let him see <eos> in case thy greatnes he can gesse in harte <eos> by that which but the picture is of thee <eos> rome is no more : but if the shade of rome <eos> may of the bodie yeeld a seeming sight <eos> it 's like a corse drawne forth out of the tombe <eos> by magicke skill out of eternall night <eos> the corpes of rome in ashes is entombed <eos> and her great spirite , reioyned to the spirite <eos> of this great masse , is in the same enwombed <eos> but her brave writings , which , her famous merite <eos> in spight of time out of the dust doth reare <eos> doo make her idole * through the world appeare <eos>
oh , thou whose melody the heart obeys <eos> thou who can'st all its subject passions move <eos> whose notes to heav'n the list'ning soul can raise <eos> can thrill with pity , or can melt with love <eos> happy ! whom nature lent this native charm <eos> whose melting tones can shed with magic power <eos> a sweeter pleasure o'er the social hour <eos> the breast to softness sooth , to virtue warm — but <eos> yet more happy ! that thy life as clear <eos> from discord , as thy perfect cadence flows <eos> that tun 'd to sympathy , thy faithful tear <eos> in mild accordance falls for others woes <eos> that all the tender , pure affections bind <eos> in chains of harmony , thy willing mind <eos>
my own beloved , who hast lifted me <eos> from this drear flat of earth where i was thrown <eos> and in betwixt the languid ringlets , blown <eos> a life breath , till the forehead hopefully <eos> shines out again , as all the angels see <eos> before thy saving kiss ! my own , my own <eos> who camest to me when the world was gone <eos> and i who looked for only god , found thee <eos> i find thee : i am safe , and strong , and glad <eos> as one who stands in dewless asphodel <eos> looks backward on the tedious time he had <eos> in the upper life ... so i , with bosom swell <eos> make witness here between the good and bad <eos> that love , as strong as death , retrieves as well <eos>
the light of life has faded from thy cause <eos> high priest of heaven and hell and purgatory <eos> thy lips are loud with strains of oldworld story <eos> but the red prey was rent out of thy paws <eos> long since : and they that dying brake down thy laws <eos> have with the fires of death enkindled glory <eos> put out the flame that faltered on thy hoary <eos> high altars , waning with the world 's applause <eos> this italy was dante 's : bruno died <eos> here : campanella , too sublime for pride <eos> endured thy god 's worst here , and hence went home <eos> and what art thou , that time 's full tide should shrink <eos> for thy sake downward ? what art thou , to think <eos> thy god shall give thee back for birthright rome <eos>
through the hushed street , along the silent plain <eos> the spectral future leads its mourning train <eos> dark with the shadows of uncounted bands <eos> where man 's white lips and woman 's wringing hands <eos> track the still burden , rolling slow before <eos> that love and kindness can protect no more <eos> the smiling babe that , called to mortal strife <eos> shuts its meek eyes and drops its little life <eos> the drooping child who prays in vain to live <eos> and pleads for help its parent cannot give <eos> the pride of beauty stricken in its flower <eos> the strength of manhood broken in an hour <eos> age in its weakness , bowed by toil and care <eos> traced in sad lines beneath its silvered hair <eos>
and now , amid the ruin 's darkest shade <eos> the virgin 's eye beheld where pale blue flames <eos> rose wavering , now just gleaming from the earth <eos> and now in darkness drown 'd . an aged man <eos> sat near , seated on what in long past days <eos> had been some sculptur 'd monument , now fallen <eos> and half obscured by moss , and gathered heaps <eos> of withered yew leaves and earth mouldering bones <eos> and shining in the ray was seen the track <eos> of slimy snail obscene . composed his look <eos> his eye was large and rayless , and fix 'd full <eos> upon the maid ; the blue flames on his face <eos> stream 'd a pale light ; his face was of the hue <eos> of death ; his limbs were mantled in a shroud <eos>
did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye <eos> ‘ gainst whom the world could not hold argument <eos> persuade my heart to this false perjury <eos> vows for thee broke deserve not punishment <eos> a woman i forswore ; but i will prove <eos> thou being a goddess , i forswore not thee <eos> my vow was earthly , thou a heavenly love <eos> thy grace being gain 'd cures all disgrace in me <eos> my vow was breath , and breath a vapour is <eos> then , thou fair sun , that on this earth doth shine <eos> exhale this vapour vow ; in thee it is <eos> if broken , then it is no fault of mine <eos> if by me broke , what fool is not so wise <eos> to break an oath , to win a paradise <eos>
“ sic semper tyrannis ! ” the assassin cried <eos> as lincoln fell . o villain ! who than he <eos> more lived to set both slave and tyrant free <eos> or so enrapt with plans of freedom died <eos> that even thy treacherous deed shall glance aside <eos> and do the dead man 's will by land and sea <eos> win bloodless battles , and make that to be <eos> which to his living mandate was denied <eos> peace to that gentle heart ! the peace he sought <eos> for all mankind , nor for it dies in vain <eos> rest to the uncrowned king , who , toiling , brought <eos> his bleeding country through that dreadful reign <eos> who , living , earned a world 's revering thought <eos> and , dying , leaves his name without a stain <eos>
the knightly legend on thy shield betrays <eos> the moral of thy life ; a forecast wise <eos> and that large honor that deceit defies <eos> inspired thy fathers in the elder days <eos> who decked thy scutcheon with that sturdy phrase <eos> to be , rather than seem . as eve 's red skies <eos> surpass the morning 's rosy prophecies <eos> thy life to that proud boast its answer pays <eos> scorning thy faith and purpose to defend <eos> the ever mutable multitude at last <eos> will hail the power they did not comprehend <eos> thy fame will broaden through the centuries <eos> as , storm and billowy tumult overpast <eos> the moon rules calmly o'er the conquered seas <eos>
thou art the rock of empire , set mid seas <eos> between the east and west , that god has built <eos> advance thy roman borders where thou wilt <eos> while run thy armies true with his decrees <eos> law , justice , liberty ,— great gifts are these <eos> watch that they spread where english blood is spilt <eos> lest , mixt and sullied with his country 's guilt <eos> the soldier 's life stream flow and heaven displease <eos> two swords there are : one naked , apt to smite <eos> thy blade of war ; and , battled storied , one <eos> rejoices in the sheath and hides from light <eos> american i am ; would wars were done <eos> now westward look , my country bids good night <eos> peace to the world from ports without a gun <eos>
when i had chosen on the river 's edge <eos> such station , that the distance of the stream <eos> alone did separate me ; there i stay 'd <eos> my steps for clearer prospect , and beheld <eos> the flames go onward , leaving , as they went <eos> the air behind them painted as with trail <eos> of liveliest pencils ! so distinct were mark 'd <eos> all those sev'n listed colours , whence the sun <eos> maketh his bow , and cynthia her zone <eos> these streaming gonfalons did flow beyond <eos> my vision ; and ten paces , as i guess <eos> parted the outermost . beneath a sky <eos> so beautiful , came foul and twenty elders <eos> by two and two , with flower de luces crown 'd <eos>
with shame repulsed , with grief and fury driven <eos> the frantic asius thus accuses heaven <eos> “ in powers immortal who shall now believe <eos> can those too flatter , and can jove deceive <eos> what man could doubt but troy ’ s victorious power <eos> should humble greece , and this her fatal hour <eos> but like when wasps from hollow crannies drive <eos> to guard the entrance of their common hive <eos> darkening the rock , while with unwearied wings <eos> they strike the assailants , and infix their stings <eos> a race determined , that to death contend <eos> so fierce these greeks their last retreats defend <eos> gods ! shall two warriors only guard their gates <eos> repel an army , and defraud the fates <eos>
when erst her hand the crust of chaos thirl 'd <eos> and forced from his black breast the bursting world <eos> high swell 'd the huge existence crude and crass <eos> a formless dark impermeated mass <eos> no light nor heat nor cold nor moist nor dry <eos> but all concocting in their causes lie <eos> millions of periods , such as these her spheres <eos> learn since to measure and to call their years <eos> she broods the mass ; then into motion brings <eos> and seeks and sorts the principles of things <eos> pours in the attractive and repulsive force <eos> whirls forth her globes in cosmogyral course <eos> by myriads and by millions , scaled sublime <eos> to scoop their skies , and curve the rounds of time <eos>
umbrageous woods , green dells , and mountains high <eos> and bright cascades , and wide cerulean seas <eos> slumbering , or snow wreathed by the freshening breeze <eos> and isles like motionless clouds upon the sky <eos> in silent summer noons , late charmed mine eye <eos> until my soul was stirred like wind touched trees <eos> and passionate love and speechless ecstasies <eos> up raised the thoughts in spiritual depths that lie <eos> fair scenes , ye haunt me still ! yet i behold <eos> this sultry city on the level shore <eos> not all unmoved ; for here our fathers bold <eos> won proud historic names in days of yore <eos> and here are generous hearts that ne'er grow cold <eos> and many a friendly hand and open door <eos>
from records true my legends i rehearse <eos> and string the pearls of wisdom in my verse <eos> that in the glimmering days of life 's decline <eos> its fruits , in wealth and honor , may be mine <eos> my verse , a structure pointing to the skies <eos> whose solid strength destroying time defies <eos> all praise the noble work , save only those <eos> of impious life , or base malignant foes <eos> all blest with learning read , and read again <eos> the sovereign smiles , and thus approves my strain <eos> “ richer by far , firdusi , than a mine <eos> of precious gems , is this bright lay of thine <eos> centuries may pass away , but still my page <eos> will be the boast of each succeeding age <eos>
is it a reed that 's shaken by the wind <eos> or what is it that ye go forth to see <eos> lords , lawyers , statesmen , squires of low degree <eos> men known , and men unknown , sick , lame , and blind <eos> post forward all , like creatures of one kind <eos> with first fruit offerings crowd to bend the knee <eos> in france , before the new born majesty <eos> ‘ tis ever thus . ye men of prostrate mind <eos> a seemly reverence may be paid to power <eos> but that 's a loyal virtue , never sown <eos> in haste , nor springing with a transient shower <eos> when truth , when sense , when liberty were flown <eos> what hardship had it been to wait an hour <eos> shame on you , feeble heads , to slavery prone <eos>

the crimson panes like blood drops stigmatise <eos> the western floor . the aisles are mute and cold <eos> a rigid fetich in her robe of gold <eos> the virgin of the pillar , with blank eyes <eos> enthroned beneath her votive canopies <eos> gathers a meagre remnant to her fold <eos> the rest is solitude ; the church , grown old <eos> stands stark and grey beneath the burning skies <eos> well nigh again its mighty framework grows <eos> to be a part of nature 's self , withdrawn <eos> from hot humanity 's impatient woes <eos> the floor is ridged like some rude mountain lawn <eos> and in the east one giant window shows <eos> the roseate coldness of an alp at dawn <eos>
all childhood , reverence clothed thee , undefined <eos> as for some being of another race <eos> ah , not with it , departing — growing apace <eos> as years did bring me manhood 's loftier mind <eos> able to see thy human life behind <eos> the same hid heart , the same revealing face <eos> my own dim contest settling into grace <eos> of sorrow , strife , and victory combined <eos> so i beheld my god , in childhood 's morn <eos> a mist , a darkness , great , and far apart <eos> moveless and dim — i scarce could say thou art <eos> my manhood came , of joy and sadness born <eos> full soon the misty dark , asunder torn <eos> revealed man 's glory , god 's great human heart <eos>
the sea was sapphire coloured , and the sky <eos> burned like a heated opal through the air <eos> we hoisted sail ; the wind was blowing fair <eos> for the blue lands that to the eastward lie <eos> from the steep prow i marked with quickening eye <eos> zakynthos , every olive grove and creek <eos> ithaca 's cliff , lycaon 's snowy peak <eos> and all the flower strewn hills of arcady <eos> the flapping of the sail against the mast <eos> the ripple of the water on the side <eos> the ripple of girls ’ laughter at the stern <eos> the only sounds : when ‘ gan the west to burn <eos> and a red sun upon the seas to ride <eos> i stood upon the soil of greece at last <eos>
now other hands take up that mother 's task <eos> another breast nurses that sweet young child <eos> with growing love ; for who can nurse a child <eos> feel its warm breath , and little dimpled hands <eos> kiss its soft lips , look in its laughing eyes <eos> hear its low cooing love notes soft and sweet <eos> and not feel something of that miracle <eos> a mother 's love — so old yet ever new <eos> stronger than death , bravest among the brave <eos> gentle as brave , watchful both night and day <eos> that never changes , never tires nor sleeps <eos> whence comes this wondrous and undying love <eos> whence can it come , unless it comes from heaven <eos> whose life is love — eternal , perfect love <eos>
thus the poor ass whose appetite has ne'er <eos> known than the thistle any sweeter fare <eos> thinks all the world eats thistles . thus the clown <eos> the wit and mentor of the country town <eos> grins through the collar of a horse and thinks <eos> others for pleasure do as he for drinks <eos> though secretly , because unwilling still <eos> in public to attest their lack of skill <eos> each dunce whose life and mind all follies mar <eos> believes as he is all men living are <eos> his vices theirs , their understandings his <eos> naught that he knows not , all he fancies , is <eos> how odd that any mind such stuff should boast <eos> how natural to write it in the post <eos>
homes of our sires , where learning 's temple rose <eos> while vet they struggled with their banded foes <eos> as in the west thy century 's sun descends <eos> one parting gleam its dying radiance lends <eos> darker and deeper though the shadows fall <eos> from the gray towers on doubting castle 's wall <eos> though pope and pagan re array their hosts <eos> and her new armor youthful science boasts <eos> truth , for whose altar rose this holy shrine <eos> shall fly for refuge to these bowers of thine <eos> no past shall chain her with its rusted vow <eos> no jew 's phylactery bind her christian brow <eos> but faith shall smile to find her sister free <eos> and nobler manhood draw its life from thee <eos>
must all of worth be travailled for , and those <eos> life 's brightest stars rise from a troubled sea <eos> must years go by in sad uncertainty <eos> leaving us doubting whose the conquering blows <eos> are we or fate the victors ? time which shows <eos> all inner meanings will reveal , but we <eos> shall never know the upshot . ours to be <eos> wasted with longing , shattered in the throes <eos> the agonies of splendid dreams , which day <eos> dims from our vision , but each night brings back <eos> we strive to hold their grandeur , and essay <eos> to be the thing we dream . sudden we lack <eos> the flash of insight , life grows drear and gray <eos> and hour follows hour , nerveless , slack <eos>
first , most , to thee , my son , i give this book <eos> in which a friend 's and brother 's verses blend <eos> with mine ; for not son only — brother , friend <eos> art thou , through sonship which no veil can brook <eos> between the eyes that in each other look <eos> or any shadow ‘ twixt the hearts that tend <eos> still nearer , with divine approach , to end <eos> in love eternal that cannot be shook <eos> when all the shakable shall cease to be <eos> with growing hope i greet the coming day <eos> when from thy journey done i welcome thee <eos> who sharest in the names of all the three <eos> and take thee to the two , and humbly say <eos> let this man be the fourth with us , i pray <eos>
there had been phantoms , pale remembered shapes <eos> of this and this occasion , sisterly <eos> in their resemblances , each effigy <eos> crowned with the same bright hair above the nape 's <eos> white rounded firmness , and each body alert <eos> with such swift loveliness , that very rest <eos> seemed a poised movement : ... phantoms that impressed <eos> but a faint influence and could bless or hurt <eos> no more than dreams . and these ghost things were she <eos> for formless still , without identity <eos> not one she seemed , not clear , but many and dim <eos> one face among the legions of the street <eos> indifferent mystery , she was for him <eos> something still uncreated , incomplete <eos>
a life so sacred , such serene repose <eos> seem 'd heaven itself , till one suggestion rose <eos> that vice should triumph , virtue vice obey <eos> this sprung some doubt of providence 's sway <eos> his hopes no more a certain prospect boast <eos> and all the tenor of his soul is lost <eos> so when a smooth expanse receives impress 'd <eos> calm nature 's image on its watery breast <eos> down bend the banks , the trees depending grow <eos> and skies beneath with answering colours glow <eos> but if a stone the gentle scene divide <eos> swift ruffling circles curl on every side <eos> and glimmering fragments of a broken sun <eos> banks , trees , and skies , in thick disorder run <eos>
contented evening ; comfortable joys <eos> the snoozing fire , and all the fields are still <eos> tranquil delight , no purpose , and no noise <eos> unless the slow wind flowing round the hill <eos> ‘ murry ’ ( the kettle ) dozes ; little mouse <eos> is rambling prudently about the floor <eos> there 's lovely conversation in this house <eos> words become princes that were slaves before <eos> what a sweet atmosphere for you and me <eos> the people that have been here left behind <eos> oh , but i fear it may turn out to be <eos> built of a dream , erected in the mind <eos> so if we speak too loud , we may awaken <eos> to find it vanished , and ourselves mistaken <eos>
science ! true daughter of old time thou art <eos> who alterest all things with thy peering eyes <eos> why preyest thou thus upon the poet 's heart <eos> vulture , whose wings are dull realities <eos> how should he love thee ? or how deem thee wise <eos> who wouldst not leave him in his wandering <eos> to seek for treasure in the jewelled skies <eos> albeit he soared with an undaunted wing <eos> hast thou not dragged diana from her car <eos> and driven the hamadryad from the wood <eos> to seek a shelter in some happier star <eos> hast thou not torn the naiad from her flood <eos> the elfin from the green grass , and from me <eos> the summer dream beneath the tamarind tree <eos>
to one who has been long in city pent <eos> ‘ tis very sweet to look into the fair <eos> and open face of heaven ,— to breathe a prayer <eos> full in the smile of the blue firmament <eos> who is more happy , when , with heart 's content <eos> fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair <eos> of wavy grass , and reads a debonair <eos> and gentle tale of love and languishment <eos> returning home at evening , with an ear <eos> catching the notes of philomel ,— and eye <eos> watching the sailing cloudlet 's bright career <eos> he mourns that day so soon has glided by <eos> e'en like the passage of an angel 's tear <eos> that falls through the clear ether silently <eos>
so i once thought ! oh , once my very soul <eos> was filled and thrilled with dreaming of that role <eos> life seemed so wonderful ; it held for me <eos> no purpose , no ambition , but to be <eos> loving and loved . my highest thought of fame <eos> was some day bearing my dear lover 's name <eos> alone , i ofttimes uttered it aloud <eos> or wrote it down , half timid , and all proud <eos> to see myself lost utterly in him <eos> as some small star might joy in growing dim <eos> when sinking in the sun ; or as the dew <eos> forgetting the brief little life it knew <eos> in space , might on the ocean 's bosom fall <eos> and ask for nothing — only to give all <eos>
hail ! gifted youth , whose passion breathing lay <eos> portrays a mind attuned to noblest themes <eos> a mind , which , wrapt in fancy 's high wrought dreams <eos> to nature 's veriest bounds its daring way <eos> can wing : what charms throughout thy pages shine <eos> to win with fairy thrill the melting soul <eos> for though along impassion 'd grandeur roll <eos> yet in full power simplicity is thine <eos> proceed , sweet bard ! and the heaven granted fire <eos> of pity , glowing in thy feeling breast <eos> may nought destroy , may nought thy soul divest <eos> of joy — of rapture in the living lyre <eos> thou tunest so magically : but may fame <eos> each passing year add honours to thy name <eos>
no other choice belphegor now had got <eos> than — try himself the hymeneal knot <eos> in florence he beheld a certain fair <eos> with charming face and smart engaging air <eos> of noble birth , but puffed with empty pride <eos> some marks of virtue , though not much beside <eos> for roderick was asked this lofty dame <eos> the father said honesta * ( such her name <eos> had many eligible offers found <eos> but , ‘ mong the num'rous band that hovered round <eos> perhaps his daughter , rod'rick ' s suit might take <eos> though he should wish for time the choice to make <eos> this approbation met , and rod'rick ‘ gan <eos> to use his arts and execute his plan <eos>
new england ! proudly may thy children claim <eos> their honored birthright by its humblest name <eos> cold are thy skies , but , ever fresh and clear <eos> no rank malaria stains thine atmosphere <eos> no fungous weeds invade thy scanty soil <eos> scarred by the ploughshares of unslumbering toil <eos> long may the doctrines by thy sages taught <eos> raised from the quarries where their sires have wrought <eos> be like the granite of thy rock ribbed land <eos> as slow to rear , as obdurate to stand <eos> and as the ice that leaves thy crystal mine <eos> chills the fierce alcohol in the creole 's wine <eos> so may the doctrines of thy sober school <eos> keep the hot theories of thy neighbors cool <eos>
the silent room , the heavy creeping shade <eos> the dead that travel fast , the opening door <eos> the murdered brother rising through the floor <eos> the ghost 's white fingers on thy shoulders laid <eos> and then the lonely duel in the glade <eos> the broken swords , the stifled scream , the gore <eos> thy grand revengeful eyes when all is o'er <eos> these things are well enough ,    but thou wert made <eos> for more august creation ! frenzied lear <eos> should at thy bidding wander on the heath <eos> with the shrill fool to mock him , romeo <eos> for thee should lure his love , and desperate fear <eos> pluck richard 's recreant dagger from its sheath   <eos> thou trumpet set for shakespeare 's lips to blow <eos>
false hope prolongs my ever certain grief <eos> traitor to me , and faithful to my love <eos> a thousand times it promised me relief <eos> yet never any true effect i prove <eos> oft when i find in her no truth at all <eos> i banish her , and blame her treachery <eos> yet soon again i must her back recall <eos> as one that dies without her company <eos> thus often , as i chase my hope from me <eos> straightway she hastes her unto delia 's eyes <eos> fed with some pleasing look , there shall she be <eos> and so sent back . and thus my fortune lies <eos> looks feed my hope , hope fosters me in vain <eos> hopes are unsure when certain is my pain <eos>
o gracious mother , whose benignant breast <eos> wakes us to life , and lulls us all to rest <eos> how thy sweet features , kind to every clime <eos> mock with their smile the wrinkled front of time <eos> we stain thy flowers ,— they blossom o'er the dead <eos> we rend thy bosom , and it gives us bread <eos> o'er the red field that trampling strife has torn <eos> waves the green plumage of thy tasselled corn <eos> our maddening conflicts sear thy fairest plain <eos> still thy soft answer is the growing grain <eos> yet , o our mother , while uncounted charms <eos> steal round our hearts in thine embracing arms <eos> let not our virtues in thy love decay <eos> and thy fond sweetness waste our strength away <eos>
and there she would have lain for evermore <eos> a marble image on the shadowy shore <eos> in outward seeming , but within oppressed <eos> with torments , knowing neither hope nor rest <eos> but as she lay the phoenix flew along <eos> going to egypt , and knew all her wrong <eos> and pitied her , beholding her sweet face <eos> and flew to love and told him of her case <eos> and love , in guerdon of the tale he told <eos> changed all the feathers of his neck to gold <eos> and he flew on to egypt glad at heart <eos> but love himself gat swiftly for his part <eos> to rocky t æ narus , and found her there <eos> laid half a furlong from the outer air <eos>
from all the mischiefs that i mention here <eos> preserve us , heaven , in this approaching year <eos> from civil wars and those uncivil things <eos> that hate the race of all our queens and kings <eos> from those who for self ends would all betray <eos> from saints that curse and flatter when they pray <eos> from those that hold it merit to rebel <eos> in treason , murthers , and in theft excel <eos> from those new teachers have destroy 'd the old <eos> and those that turn the gospel into gold <eos> from a high court , and that rebellious crew <eos> that did their hands in royal blood imbrue <eos> defend us , heaven , and to the throne restore <eos> the rightful heir , and we will ask no more <eos>
gold , and fair marbles , and again more gold <eos> and space of halls afloat that glance and gleam <eos> like the green heights of sunset heaven , or seem <eos> the golden steeps of sunrise red and cold <eos> on deserts where dark exile keeps the fold <eos> fast of the flocks of torment , where no beam <eos> falls of kind light or comfort save in dream <eos> these we far off behold not , who behold <eos> the cordage woven of curses , and the decks <eos> with mortal hate and mortal peril paven <eos> from stem to stern the lines of doom engraven <eos> that mark for sure inevitable wrecks <eos> those sails predestinate , though no storm vex <eos> to miss on earth and find in hell their haven <eos>
then blue smoke haze of the cooking rose <eos> and tent peg answered to hammer nose <eos> and the picketed ponies , shag and wild <eos> strained at their ropes as the feed was piled <eos> and the bubbling camels beside the load <eos> sprawled for a furlong adown the road <eos> and the persian pussy cats , brought for sale <eos> spat at the dogs from the camel bale <eos> and the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food <eos> and the camp fires twinkled by fort jumrood <eos> and there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk <eos> a savour of camels and carpets and musk <eos> a murmur of voices , a reek of smoke <eos> to tell us the trade of the khyber woke <eos>
whilst by thy eyes pursued , my poor heart flew <eos> into the sacred refuge of thy breast <eos> thy rigour in that sanctuary slew <eos> that which thy succ'ring mercy should have blest <eos> no privilege of faith could it protect <eos> faith being with blood and five years witness signed <eos> wherein no show gave cause of least suspect <eos> for well thou saw'st my love and how i pined <eos> yet no mild comfort would thy brow reveal <eos> no lightning looks which falling hopes erect <eos> what boots to laws of succour to appeal <eos> ladies and tyrants never laws respect <eos> then there i die from whence my life should come <eos> and by that hand whom such deeds ill become <eos>
yet take the colder copy from my hand <eos> not for its own but for the master 's sake <eos> take it , as thou , returning home , wilt take <eos> from that divinest soft italian land <eos> fixed shadows of the beautiful and grand <eos> in sunless pictures that the sun doth make <eos> reflections that may pleasant memories wake <eos> of all that raffael touched , or angelo planned <eos> as these may keep what memory else might lose <eos> so may this photograph of verse impart <eos> an image , though without the native hues <eos> of calderon 's fire , and yet with calderon 's art <eos> of what thou lovest through a kindred muse <eos> that sings in heaven , yet nestles in the heart <eos>
the star of my mishap imposed this pain <eos> to spend the april of my years in grief <eos> finding my fortune ever in the wane <eos> with still fresh cares , supplied with no relief <eos> yet thee i blame not , though for thee ‘ tis done <eos> but these weak wings presuming to aspire <eos> which now are melted by thine eyes ’ bright sun <eos> that makes me fall from off my high desire <eos> and in my fall i cry for help with speed <eos> no pitying eye looks back upon my fears <eos> no succour find i now when most i need <eos> my heats must drown in th'ocean of my tears <eos> which still must bear the title of my wrong <eos> caused by those cruel beams that were so strong <eos>
thus near the gates conferring as they drew <eos> argus , the dog , his ancient master knew <eos> he , not unconscious of the voice and tread <eos> lifts to the sound his ear , and rears his head <eos> bred by ulysses , nourished at his board <eos> but , ah ! not fated long to please his lord <eos> to him , his swiftness and his strength were vain <eos> the voice of glory called him o'er the main <eos> till then , in every sylvan chase renowned <eos> with argus , argus , rung the woods around <eos> with him the youth pursued the goat or fawn <eos> or traced the mazy leveret o'er the lawn <eos> now left to man 's ingratitude he lay <eos> unhoused , neglected in the public way <eos>
“ forward , and stretch ye to your utmost speed <eos> i ask you not with those of diomed <eos> in vain to strive , whom pallas hath endued <eos> with added swiftness , and his triumph will 'd <eos> but haste ye , and o'ertake atrides ’ car <eos> nor be by aethe , by a mare , disgrac 'd <eos> why , my brave horses , why be left behind <eos> this too i warn ye , and will make it good <eos> no more at nestor 's hand shall ye receive <eos> your provender , but with the sword be slain <eos> if by your faults a lower prize be ours <eos> then rouse ye now , and put forth all your speed <eos> and i will so contrive , as not to fail <eos> of slipping past them in the narrow way <eos>
night is the true democracy . when day <eos> like some great monarch with his train has passed <eos> in regal pomp and splendor to the last <eos> the stars troop forth along the milky way <eos> a jostling crowd , in radiant disarray <eos> on heaven 's broad boulevard in pageants vast <eos> and things of earth , the hunted and outcast <eos> come from their haunts and hiding places ; yea <eos> even from the nooks and crannies of the mind <eos> visions uncouth and vagrant fancies start <eos> and specters of dead joy , that shun the light <eos> and impotent regrets and terrors blind <eos> each one , in form grotesque , playing its part <eos> in the fantastic mardi gras of night <eos>
thine eyes i love , and they as pitying me <eos> knowing thy heart torment me with disdain <eos> have put on black , and loving mourners be <eos> looking with pretty ruth upon my pain <eos> and truly not the morning sun of heaven <eos> better becomes the grey cheeks of the east <eos> nor that full star that ushers in the even <eos> doth half that glory to the sober west <eos> as those two mourning eyes become thy face <eos> o let it then as well beseem thy heart <eos> to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace <eos> and suit thy pity like in every part <eos> then will i swear beauty herself is black <eos> and all they foul that thy complexion lack <eos>
my hungry eyes , through greedy covetize <eos> still to behold the obiect of their paine <eos> with no contentment can themselves suffize <eos> but having , pine , and having not , complaine <eos> for lacking it , they cannot lyfe sustayne <eos> and having it , they gaze on it the more <eos> in their amazement lyke narcissus vaine <eos> whose eyes him starv 'd : so plenty makes me poore <eos> yet are mine eyes so filled with the store <eos> of that faire sight , that nothing else they brooke <eos> but lothe the things which they did like before <eos> and can no more endure on them to looke <eos> all this worlds glory seemeth vayne to me <eos> and all their showes but shadowes , saving she <eos>
rise then , my son , first partner of my fame <eos> with early toils to build thy sacred name <eos> in high behest , for his own legate known <eos> proclaim the bounties of our sire the sun <eos> tell how his fruits beneath our culture rise <eos> his stars , how glorious , gem our cloudless skies <eos> and how to us his hand hath kindly given <eos> his peaceful laws , the purest grace of heaven <eos> with power to widen his terrestrial sway <eos> and give our blessings where he gives the day <eos> yet , should the stubborn nations still prepare <eos> the shaft of slaughter for the barbarous war <eos> tell them we know to tread the crimson plain <eos> and god 's own children never yield to man <eos>
unhappy wit , like most mistaken things <eos> atones not for that envy which it brings <eos> in youth alone its empty praise we boast <eos> but soon the short liv 'd vanity is lost <eos> like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies <eos> that gaily blooms , but ev'n in blooming dies <eos> what is this wit , which must our cares employ <eos> the owner 's wife , that other men enjoy <eos> then most our trouble still when most admir 'd <eos> and still the more we give , the more requir 'd <eos> whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease <eos> sure some to vex , but never all to please <eos> ‘ tis what the vicious fear , the virtuous shun <eos> by fools't is hated , and by knaves undone <eos>
but o thou cruel stepmother and hard <eos> to thy poor fenceless , naked child , the bard <eos> a thing unteachable in worldly skill <eos> and half an idiot too , more helpless still <eos> no heels to bear him from the op'ning dun <eos> no claws to dig , his hated sight to shun <eos> no horns , but those by luckless hymen worn <eos> and those , alas ! not amalthea 's horn <eos> no nerves olfact'ry , true to mammon 's foot <eos> or grunting , grub sagacious , evil 's root <eos> the silly sheep that wanders wild astray <eos> is not more friendless , is not more a prey <eos> vampyre — booksellers drain him to the heart <eos> and viper — critics cureless venom dart <eos>
since fate relentless stopp 'd their heavenly voice <eos> no more the forests ring , or groves rejoice <eos> who now shall charm the shades , where cowley strung <eos> his living harp , and lofty denham sung <eos> but hark ! the groves rejoice , the forest rings <eos> are these revived ? or is it granville sings <eos> ‘ tis yours , my lord , to bless our soft retreats <eos> and call the muses to their ancient seats <eos> to paint anew the flowery sylvan scenes <eos> to crown the forest with immortal greens <eos> make windsor hills in lofty numbers rise <eos> and lift her turrets nearer to the skies <eos> to sing those honours you deserve to wear <eos> and add new lustre to her silver star <eos>
they that have power to hurt , and will do none <eos> that do not do the thing , they most do show <eos> who moving others , are themselves as stone <eos> unmoved , cold , and to temptation slow <eos> they rightly do inherit heaven 's graces <eos> and husband nature 's riches from expense <eos> tibey are the lords and owners of their faces <eos> others , but stewards of their excellence <eos> the summer 's flower is to the summer sweet <eos> though to it self , it only live and die <eos> but if that flower with base infection meet <eos> the basest weed outbraves his dignity <eos> for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds <eos> lilies that fester , smell far worse than weeds <eos>
those pretty wrongs that liberty commits <eos> when i am sometime absent from thy heart <eos> thy beauty , and thy years full well befits <eos> for still temptation follows where thou art <eos> gentle thou art , and therefore to be won <eos> beauteous thou art , therefore to be assailed <eos> and when a woman woos , what woman 's son <eos> will sourly leave her till he have prevailed <eos> ay me , but yet thou mightst my seat forbear <eos> and chide thy beauty , and thy straying youth <eos> who lead thee in their riot even there <eos> where thou art forced to break a twofold truth <eos> hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee <eos> thine by thy beauty being false to me <eos>
i wish i could remember that first day <eos> first hour , first moment of your meeting me <eos> if bright or dim the season , it might be <eos> summer or winter for aught i can say <eos> so unrecorded did it slip away <eos> so blind was i to see and to foresee <eos> so dull to mark the budding of my tree <eos> that would not blossom yet for many a may <eos> if only i could recollect it , such <eos> a day of days ! i let it come and go <eos> as traceless as a thaw of bygone snow <eos> it seemed to mean so little , meant so much <eos> if only now i could recall that touch <eos> first touch of hand in hand — did one but know <eos>
then arthur rose and lancelot followed him <eos> and while they stood without the doors , the king <eos> turned to him saying , ‘ is it then so well <eos> or mine the blame that oft i seem as he <eos> of whom was written , “ a sound is in his ears <eos> the foot that loiters , bidden go ,— the glance <eos> that only seems half loyal to command <eos> a manner somewhat fallen from reverence <eos> or have i dreamed the bearing of our knights <eos> tells of a manhood ever less and lower <eos> or whence the fear lest this my realm , upreared <eos> by noble deeds at one with noble vows <eos> from flat confusion and brute violences <eos> reel back into the beast , and be no more <eos>
thou drowsy god , whose blurred eyes , half awink <eos> muse on me —, drifting out upon thy dreams <eos> i lave my soul as in enchanted streams <eos> where revelling satyrs pipe along the brink <eos> and tipsy with the melody they drink <eos> uplift their dangling hooves , and down the beams <eos> of sunshine dance like motes . thy languor seems <eos> an ocean depth of love wherein i sink <eos> like some fond argonaut , right willingly <eos> because of wooing eyes upturned to mine <eos> and siren arms that coil their sorcery <eos> about my neck , with kisses so divine <eos> the heavens reel above me , and the sea <eos> swallows and licks its wet lips over me <eos>
o lords our gods , the times are evil : you <eos> redeem the time , because of evil days <eos> while abject souls in servitude of praise <eos> bow down to heads untitled , and the crew <eos> whose honour dwells but in the deeds they do <eos> from loftier hearts your nobler servants raise <eos> more manful salutation : yours are bays <eos> that not the dawn 's plebeian pearls bedew <eos> yours , laurels plucked not of such hands as wove <eos> old age its chaplet in colonos ’ grove <eos> our time , with heaven and with itself at odds <eos> makes all lands else as seas that seethe and boil <eos> but yours are yet the corn and wine and oil <eos> and yours our worship yet , o lords our gods <eos>
xii . and by such living witness didst thou preach <eos> not with blind hands of groping forward thrust <eos> into the darkness , gathering only dust <eos> but by this real sign — that thou didst reach <eos> in natural order , rising each from each <eos> thy own ideals of the true and just <eos> and that as thou didst live , even so he must <eos> who would aspire his fellow men to teach <eos> looking perpetual from new heights of thought <eos> on his old self . of art no scorner thou <eos> instead of leafy chaplet , on thy brow <eos> wearing the light of manhood , thou hast brought <eos> death unto life ! above all statues now <eos> immortal artist , hail ! thy work is wrought <eos>
within a thick and spreading hawthorn bush <eos> that overhung a molehill large and round <eos> i heard from morn to morn a merry thrush <eos> sing hymns to sunrise , and i drank the sound <eos> with joy ; and , often an intruding guest <eos> i watched her secret toils from day to day <eos> how true she warped the moss , to form a nest <eos> and modelled it within with wood and clay <eos> and by and by , like heath bells gilt with dew <eos> there lay her shining eggs , as bright as flowers <eos> ink spotted over shells of greeny blue <eos> and there i witnessed in the sunny hours <eos> a brood of nature 's minstrels chirp and fly <eos> glad as that sunshine and the laughing sky <eos>
autumn comes laden with her ripened load <eos> of fruitage and so scatters them abroad <eos> that each fern smothered heath and mole hill waste <eos> are black with bramble berries — where in haste <eos> the chubby urchins from the village hie <eos> to feast them there , stained with the purple dye <eos> while painted woods around my rambles be <eos> in draperies worthy of eternity <eos> yet will the leaves soon patter on the ground <eos> and death 's deaf voice awake at every sound <eos> one drops — then others — and the last that fell <eos> rings for those left behind their passing bell <eos> thus memory every where her tidings brings <eos> how sad death robs us of life 's dearest things <eos>
throughout the country nothing now was heard <eos> save talk of civil war ; yet undeterred <eos> was he , by what was going on around <eos> from his employment ; and kept gaining ground <eos> the village of brave soldier 's was quite full <eos> and they , alone , made business far from dull <eos> when he at first commended , he made a rule <eos> for which some folks then deemed him quite a fool <eos> to make good work and cheap , and have his pay <eos> for all he sold ; and this he did always <eos> he had been taught to look honesty <eos> as the best part of business policy <eos> and his experience fully proved the truth <eos> of that old maxim learned in early youth <eos>
what seekest thou , far in the unknown land <eos> in hope i follow joy gone on before <eos> in hope and fear persistent more and more <eos> as the dry desert lengthens out its sand <eos> whilst day and night i carry in my hand <eos> the golden key to ope the golden door <eos> of golden home ; yet mine eye weepeth sore <eos> for long the journey is that makes no stand <eos> and who is this that veiled doth walk with thee <eos> lo , this is love that walketh at my right <eos> one exile holds us both , and we are bound <eos> to selfsame home joys in the land of light <eos> weeping thou walkest with him ; weepeth he <eos> some sobbing weep , some weep and make no sound <eos>
the hostess whispered him she thought her spouse <eos> again , my dear , such sparks let 's never house <eos> pray do n't you hear how they together chat <eos> just then the husband raised himself and sat <eos> is this your plan ? said he with mighty rage <eos> was it for this you would my house engage <eos> you understand me , but i 'll seek redress <eos> think you so very cheap to have success <eos> what , would you ruin families at will <eos> and with our daughters take at ease your fill <eos> away , i say ! my house this moment quit <eos> and as for you , abominable chit <eos> i 'll have your life : this hour you breathe your last <eos> such creatures only can with beasts be classed <eos>
then while eurynome the mandate bears <eos> from heaven minerva shoots with guardian cares <eos> o'er all her senses , as the couch she press 'd <eos> she pours , a pleasing , deep and death like rest <eos> with every beauty every feature arms <eos> bids her cheeks glow , and lights up all her charms <eos> in her love darting eyes awakes the fires <eos> ( immortal gifts ! to kindle soft desires <eos> from limb to limb an air majestic sheds <eos> and the pure ivory o'er her bosom spreads <eos> such venus shines , when with a measured bound <eos> she smoothly gliding swims the harmonious round <eos> when with the graces in the dance she moves <eos> and fires the gazing gods with ardent loves <eos>
i would have fled , i would have followed back <eos> that pleasant path we came , but all was changed <eos> rocky the way , abrupt , and hard to find <eos> yet i toiled on , and , toiling on , i thought <eos> ‘ that way lies youth , and wisdom , and all good <eos> for only by unlearning wisdom comes <eos> and climbing backward to diviner youth <eos> what the world teaches profits to the world <eos> what the soul teaches profits to the soul <eos> which then first stands erect with godward face <eos> when she lets fall her pack of withered facts <eos> the gleanings of the outward eye and ear <eos> and looks and listens with her finer sense <eos> nor truth nor knowledge cometh from without <eos>
beauty , sweet love , is like the morning dew <eos> whose short refresh upon the tender green <eos> cheers for a time but till the sun doth show <eos> and straight ‘ tis gone as it had never been <eos> soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish <eos> short is the glory of the blushing rose <eos> the hue which thou so carefully dost nourish <eos> yet which at length thou must be forced to lose <eos> when thou , surcharged with burden of thy years <eos> shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth <eos> and that in beauty 's lease expired appears <eos> the date of age , the kalends of our death <eos> but ah ! no more , this must not be foretold <eos> for women grieve to think they must be old <eos>
behold him trav'lling o'er th ’ extensive space <eos> between the realms of darkness and our race <eos> to pass it , scarcely he a moment took <eos> on florence instantly he cast a look <eos> delighted with the beauty of the spot <eos> he there resolved to fix his earthly lot <eos> regarding it as proper for his wiles <eos> a city famed for wanton freaks and guiles <eos> belphegor soon a noble mansion hired <eos> and furnished it with ev'ry thing desired <eos> as signor roderick he designed to pass <eos> his equipage was large of ev'ry class <eos> expense anticipating day by day <eos> what , in ten years , he had to throw away <eos>
on many a saddened hearth the evening fire <eos> burns paler as the children 's hour draws near <eos> that joyous hour his song made doubly dear <eos> and tender memories touch the faltering choir <eos> he sings no more on earth ; our vain desire <eos> aches for the voice we loved so long to hear <eos> in dorian flute notes breathing soft and clear <eos> the sweet contralto that could never tire <eos> deafened with listening to a harsher strain <eos> the maenad 's scream , the stark barbarian 's cry <eos> still for those soothing , loving tones we sigh <eos> oh , for our vanished orpheus once again <eos> the shadowy silence hears us call in vain <eos> his lips are hushed ; his song shall never die <eos>
mine eyes are filled today with old amaze <eos> at mountains , and at meadows deftly strewn <eos> with bits of the gay jewelry of june <eos> and of her splendid vesture ; and , agaze <eos> i stand where spring her bright brocade of days <eos> embroidered o'er , and listen to the flow <eos> of sudden runlets — the faint blasts they blow <eos> low , on their stony bugles , in still ways <eos> for wonders are at one , confederate yet <eos> yea , where the wearied year came to a close <eos> an odor reminiscent of the rose <eos> and everywhere her seal has summer set <eos> and , as of old , in the horizon sky <eos> the sun can find a lovely place to die <eos>
this life is full of numbness and of balk <eos> of haltingness and baffled short coming <eos> of promise unfulfilled , of everything <eos> that is puffed vanity and empty talk <eos> its very bud hangs cankered on the stalk <eos> its very song bird trails a broken wing <eos> its very spring is not indeed like spring <eos> but sighs like autumn round an aimless walk <eos> this life we live is dead for all its breath <eos> death 's self it is , set off on pilgrimage <eos> travelling with tottering steps the first short stage <eos> the second stage is one mere desert dust <eos> where death sits veiled amid creation 's rust <eos> unveil thy face , o death who art not death <eos>
call for clear water , wash thine hands , be clean <eos> cry , what is truth ? o pilate ; thou shalt know <eos> haply too soon , and gnash thy teeth for woe <eos> ere the outer darkness take thee round unseen <eos> that hides the red ghosts of thy race obscene <eos> bound nine times round with hell 's most dolorous flow <eos> and in its pools thy crownless head lie low <eos> by his of spain who dared an english queen <eos> with half a world to hearten him for fight <eos> till the wind gave his warriors and their might <eos> to shipwreck and the corpse encumbered sea <eos> but thou , take heed , ere yet thy lips wax white <eos> lest as it was with philip so it be <eos> o white of name and red of hand , with thee <eos>
outbound , your bark awaits you . were i one <eos> whose prayer availeth much , my wish should be <eos> your favoring trade wind and consenting sea <eos> by sail or steed was never love outrun <eos> and , here or there , love follows her in whom <eos> all graces and sweet charities unite <eos> the old greek beauty set in holier light <eos> and her for whom new england 's byways bloom <eos> who walks among us welcome as the spring <eos> calling up blossoms where her light feet stray <eos> god keep you both , make beautiful your way <eos> comfort , console , and bless ; and safely bring <eos> ere yet i make upon a vaster sea <eos> the unreturning voyage , my friends to me <eos>
he scarce had ended , when themselves appear 'd <eos> and from the car descended : welcom 'd back <eos> with cordial grasp of hands , and friendly words <eos> gerenian nestor first , enquiring , said <eos> “ tell me , renown 'd ulysses , pride of greece <eos> whence come these horses ? from the trojan camp <eos> or hath some god , that met you by the way <eos> bestow 'd them , radiant as the beams of light <eos> among the trojans day by day i move <eos> ‘ tis not my wont ; old warrior though i be <eos> to lag behind ; but horses such as these <eos> i never saw ; some god hath giv'n them , sure <eos> for jove , the cloud compeller , loves you both <eos> and pallas , child of aegis bearing jove <eos>
i purposed once to take my pen and write <eos> not songs , like some , tormented and awry <eos> with passion , but a cunning harmony <eos> of words and music caught from glen and height <eos> and lucid colours born of woodland light <eos> and shining places where the sea streams lie <eos> but this was when the heat of youth glowed white <eos> and since i 've put the faded purpose by <eos> i have no faultless fruits to offer you <eos> who read this book ; but certain syllables <eos> herein are borrowed from unfooted dells <eos> and secret hollows dear to noontide dew <eos> and these at least , though far between and few <eos> may catch the sense like subtle forest spells <eos>
to whom gerenian nestor thus replied <eos> “ most mighty agamemnon , king of men <eos> atrides , not unworthy are the gifts <eos> which to achilles thou design'st to send <eos> then to the tent of peleus ’ son in haste <eos> let us our chosen messengers despatch <eos> whom i shall choose , let them consent to go <eos> then first of all let phoenix lead the way <eos> beloved of jove ; the mighty ajax next <eos> with them , ulysses sage ; and let them take <eos> of heralds , hodius and eurybates <eos> bring now the hallowing water for our hands <eos> and bid be silent , while to saturn 's son <eos> that he have mercy , we address our pray'r <eos>
from yonder realms of empyrean day <eos> bursts on my ear the indignant lay <eos> there sit the sainted sage , the bard divine <eos> the few whom genius gave to shine <eos> through every unborn age and undiscover 'd clime <eos> rapt in celestial transport they <eos> yet hither oft a glance from high <eos> they send of tender sympathy <eos> to bless the place where on their opening soul <eos> first the genuine ardour stole <eos> ‘ twas milton struck the deep toned shell <eos> and , as the choral warblings round him swell <eos> meek newton 's self bends from his state sublime <eos> and nods his hoary head , and listens to the rhyme <eos>
now thrice that morning guinevere had climbed <eos> the giant tower , from whose high crest , they say <eos> men saw the goodly hills of somerset <eos> and white sails flying on the yellow sea <eos> but not to goodly hill or yellow sea <eos> looked the fair queen , but up the vale of usk <eos> by the flat meadow , till she saw them come <eos> and then descending met them at the gates <eos> embraced her with all welcome as a friend <eos> and did her honour as the prince 's bride <eos> and clothed her for her bridals like the sun <eos> and all that week was old caerleon gay <eos> for by the hands of dubric , the high saint <eos> they twain were wedded with all ceremony <eos>
dorset , the grace of courts , the muses ’ pride <eos> patron of arts , and judge of nature , died <eos> the scourge of pride , though sanctified or great <eos> of fops in learning , and of knaves in state <eos> yet soft his nature , though severe his lay <eos> his anger moral , and his wisdom gay <eos> bless 'd satirist ! who touch 'd the mean so true <eos> as show 'd vice had his hate and pity too <eos> blest courtier ! who could king and country please <eos> yet sacred keep his friendships , and his ease <eos> blest peer ! his great forefathers ’ every grace <eos> reflecting , and reflected in his race <eos> where other buckhursts , other dorsets shine <eos> and patriots still , or poets , deck the line <eos>
despairless ! hopeless ! quietly i wait <eos> on these unpeopled tracks the happy close <eos> of day , whose advent rang with noise elate <eos> whose later stage was quick with mirthful shows <eos> and clasping loves , with hate and hearty blows <eos> and dreams of coming gifts withheld by fate <eos> from morrow unto morrow , till her great <eos> dread eyes ‘ gan tell of other gifts than those <eos> and her advancing wings gloomed like a pall <eos> her speech foretelling joy became a dirge <eos> as piteous as pitiless ; and all <eos> my company had passed beyond the verge <eos> and lost me ere fate raised her blinding wings <eos> hark ! through the dusk a bird “ at heaven 's gate sings <eos>
then thus the son : “ from alybas i came <eos> my palace there ; eperitus my name <eos> not vulgar born : from aphidas , the king <eos> of polyphemon 's royal line , i spring <eos> some adverse demon from sicania bore <eos> our wandering course , and drove us on your shore <eos> far from the town , an unfrequented bay <eos> relieved our wearied vessel from the sea <eos> five years have circled since these eyes pursued <eos> ulysses parting through the sable flood <eos> prosperous he sail 'd , with dexter auguries <eos> and all the wing 'd good omens of the skies <eos> well hoped we then to meet on this fair shore <eos> whom heaven , alas ! decreed to meet no more <eos>

if i had chosen thee , thou shouldst have been <eos> a virgin proud , untamed , immaculate <eos> chaste as the morning star , a saint , a queen <eos> scarred by no wars , no violence of hate <eos> thou shouldst have been of soul commensurate <eos> with thy fair body , brave and virtuous <eos> and kind and just ; and if of poor estate <eos> at least an honest woman for my house <eos> i would have had thee come of honored blood <eos> and honorable nurture . thou shouldst bear <eos> sons to my pride and daughters to my heart <eos> and men should hold thee happy , wise , and good <eos> lo , thou art none of this , but only fair <eos> yet must i love thee , dear , and as thou art <eos>
“ not without purpose once more to return <eos> thou find'st me , my casella , where i am <eos> journeying this way ; ” i said , “ but how of thee <eos> hath so much time been lost ? ” he answer 'd straight <eos> “ no outrage hath been done to me , if he <eos> who when and whom he chooses takes , me oft <eos> this passage hath denied , since of just will <eos> his will he makes . these three months past indeed <eos> he , whose chose to enter , with free leave <eos> hath taken ; whence i wand'ring by the shore <eos> where tyber 's wave grows salt , of him gain 'd kind <eos> admittance , at that river 's mouth , tow'rd which <eos> his wings are pointed , for there always throng <eos> all such as not to archeron descend <eos>

o great and wise , clear souled and high of heart <eos> one the last flower of catholic love , that grows <eos> amid bare thorns their only thornless rose <eos> from the fierce juggling of the priests ’ loud mart <eos> yet alien , yet unspotted and apart <eos> from the blind hard foul rout whose shameless shows <eos> mock the sweet heaven whose secret no man knows <eos> with prayers and curses and the soothsayer 's art <eos> one like a storm god of the northern foam <eos> strong , wrought of rock that breasts and breaks the sea <eos> and thunders back its thunder , rhyme for rhyme <eos> answering , as though to outroar the tides of time <eos> and bid the world 's wave back — what song should be <eos> theirs that with praise would bring and sing you home <eos>
avenge , o lord , thy slaughtered saints , whose bones <eos> lie scattered on the alpine mountains cold <eos> even them who kept thy truth so pure of old <eos> when all our fathers worshipped stocks and stones <eos> forget not : in thy book record their groans <eos> who were thy sheep , and in their ancient fold <eos> slain by the bloody piedmontese that rolled <eos> mother with infant down the rocks . their moans <eos> the vales redoubled to the hills , and they <eos> to heaven . their martyred blood and ashes sow <eos> o'er all the italian fields , where still doth sway <eos> the triple tyrant ; that from these may grow <eos> a hundredfold , who , having learnt thy way <eos> early may fly the babylonian woe <eos>
vast hollow voids , beyond the utmost reach <eos> of suns , their legions withering at his nod <eos> died into day hearing the voice of god <eos> and seas new made , immense and furious , each <eos> plunged and rolled forward , feeling for a beach <eos> he walked the waters with effulgence shod <eos> this being made , he yearned for worlds to make <eos> from other chaos out beyond our night <eos> for to create is still god 's prime delight <eos> the large moon , all alone , sailed her dark lake <eos> and the first tides were moving to her might <eos> then darkness trembled , and began to quake <eos> big with the birth of stars , and when he spake <eos> a million worlds leapt into radiant light <eos>
say over again , and yet once over again <eos> that thou dost love me . though the word repeated <eos> should seem a “ cuckoo song , ” as thou dost treat it <eos> remember , never to the hill or plain <eos> valley and wood , without her cuckoo strain <eos> comes the fresh spring in all her green completed <eos> beloved , i , amid the darkness greeted <eos> by a doubtful spirit voice , in that doubt 's pain <eos> cry , “ speak once more — thou lovest ! ” who can fear <eos> too many stars , though each in heaven shall roll <eos> too many flowers , though each shall crown the year <eos> say thou dost love me , love me , love me — toll <eos> the silver iterance !— only minding , dear <eos> to love me also in silence with thy soul <eos>
there 's not a nook within this solemn pass <eos> but were an apt confessional for one <eos> taught by his summer spent , his autumn gone <eos> that life is but a tale of morning grass <eos> withered at eve . from scenes of art which chase <eos> that thought away , turn , and with watchful eyes <eos> feed it ‘ mid nature 's old felicities <eos> rocks , rivers , and smooth lakes more clear than glass <eos> untouched , unbreathed upon . thrice happy quest <eos> if from a golden perch of aspen spray <eos> ( october 's workmanship to rival may <eos> the pensive warbler of the ruddy breast <eos> that moral sweeten by a heaven taught lay <eos> lulling the year , with all its cares , to rest <eos>
happy is england ! i could be content <eos> to see no other verdure than its own <eos> to feel no other breezes than are blown <eos> through its tall woods with high romances blent <eos> yet do i sometimes feel a languishment <eos> for skies italian , and an inward groan <eos> to sit upon an alp as on a throne <eos> and half forget what world or worldling meant <eos> happy is england , sweet her artless daughters <eos> enough their simple loveliness for me <eos> enough their whitest arms in silence clinging <eos> yet do i often warmly burn to see <eos> beauties of deeper glance , and hear their singing <eos> and float with them about the summer waters <eos>
next morning , as an anxious village group <eos> stood meditating plans what best to do <eos> came little trudchen , who , in simple tones <eos> said , “ father 's at the forge — i heard him there <eos> working long hours ago ; but he is angry <eos> i raised the latch : he bade me to be gone <eos> what have i done to make him chide me so <eos> and then her bright blue eyes ran o'er with tears <eos> “ the child 's been dreaming through this troubled night <eos> said a kind dame , and drew the child towards her <eos> but the sad answers of the girl were such <eos> as led them all to seek her father 's forge <eos> ( it lay beyond the village some short span <eos> they forced the door , and there beheld the smith <eos>
me doubt possess 'd , and “ speak , ” it whisper 'd me <eos> “ speak , speak unto thy lady , that she quench <eos> thy thirst with drops of sweetness . ” yet blank awe <eos> which lords it o'er me , even at the sound <eos> of beatrice 's name , did bow me down <eos> as one in slumber held . not long that mood <eos> beatrice suffer 'd : she , with such a smile <eos> as might have made one blest amid the flames <eos> beaming upon me , thus her words began <eos> “ thou in thy thought art pond'ring ( as i deem <eos> and what i deem is truth how just revenge <eos> could be with justice punish 'd : from which doubt <eos> i soon will free thee ; so thou mark my words <eos> for they of weighty matter shall possess thee <eos>
the irresponsive silence of the land <eos> the irresponsive sounding of the sea <eos> speak both one message of one sense to me <eos> aloof , aloof , we stand aloof , so stand <eos> thou too aloof bound with the flawless band <eos> of inner solitude ; we bind not thee <eos> but who from thy self chain shall set thee free <eos> what heart shall touch thy heart ? what hand thy hand <eos> and i am sometimes proud and sometimes meek <eos> and sometimes i remember days of old <eos> when fellowship seemed not so far to seek <eos> and all the world and i seemed much less cold <eos> and at the rainbow 's foot lay surely gold <eos> and hope felt strong and life itself not weak <eos>
no other choice belphegor now had got <eos> than — try himself the hymeneal knot <eos> in florence he beheld a certain fair <eos> with charming face and smart engaging air <eos> of noble birth , but puffed with empty pride <eos> some marks of virtue , though not much beside <eos> for roderick was asked this lofty dame <eos> the father said honesta * ( such her name <eos> had many eligible offers found <eos> but , ‘ mong the num'rous band that hovered round <eos> perhaps his daughter , rod'rick ' s suit might take <eos> though he should wish for time the choice to make <eos> this approbation met , and rod'rick ‘ gan <eos> to use his arts and execute his plan <eos>
‘ twas the night after christmas , and all through the house <eos> not a creature was stirring — excepting a mouse <eos> the stockings were flung in haste over the chair <eos> for hopes of st. nicholas were no longer there <eos> the children were restlessly tossing in bed <eos> for the pie and the candy were heavy as lead <eos> while mamma in her kerchief , and i in my gown <eos> had just made up our minds that we would not lie down <eos> when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter <eos> i sprang from my chair to see what was the matter <eos> away to the window i went with a dash <eos> flung open the shutter , and threw up the sash <eos> the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow <eos> gave the lustre of noon day to objects below <eos>
care charmer sleep , son of the sable night <eos> brother to death , in silent darkness born <eos> relieve my anguish , and restore the light <eos> with dark forgetting of my care , return <eos> and let the day be time enough to mourn <eos> the shipwreck of my ill advised youth <eos> let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn <eos> without the torments of the night 's untruth <eos> cease , dreams , the images of day desires <eos> to model forth the passions of to morrow <eos> never let the rising sun prove you liars <eos> to add more grief , to aggravate my sorrow <eos> still let me sleep , embracing clouds in vain <eos> and never wake to feel the day 's disdain <eos>
the winds have talked with him confidingly <eos> the trees have whispered to him ; and the night <eos> hath held him gently as a mother might <eos> and taught him all sad tones of melody <eos> the mountains have bowed to him ; and the sea <eos> in clamorous waves , and murmurs exquisite <eos> hath told him all her sorrow and delight <eos> her legends fair — her darkest mystery <eos> his verse blooms like a flower , night and day <eos> bees cluster round his rhymes ; and twitterings <eos> of lark and swallow , in an endless may <eos> are mingling with the tender songs he sings <eos> nor shall he cease to sing — in every lay <eos> of nature 's voice he sings — and will alway <eos>
if thou hadst been a painter , what fresh looks <eos> what outbursts of pent glories , what new grace <eos> had shone upon us from the great world 's face <eos> how had we read , as in eternal books <eos> the love of god in loneliest shiest nooks <eos> a lily , in merest lines thy hand did trace <eos> had plainly been god 's child of lower race <eos> and oh how strong the hills , songful the brooks <eos> to thee all nature 's meanings lie light bare <eos> because thy heart is nature 's inner side <eos> clear as , to us , earth on the dawn 's gold tide <eos> her notion vast up in thy soul did rise <eos> thine is the world , thine all its splendours rare <eos> thou man ideal , with the unsleeping eyes <eos>
sweet soul , which , in the april of thy years <eos> for to enrich the heaven mad'st poor this round <eos> and now , with flaming rays of glory crown 'd <eos> most blest abides above the sphere of spheres <eos> if heavenly laws , alas ! have not thee bound <eos> from looking to this globe that all upbears <eos> if ruth and pity there above be found <eos> oh , deign to lend a look unto these tears <eos> do not disdain , dear ghost , this sacrifice <eos> and though i raise not pillars to thy praise <eos> my offerings take , let this for me suffice <eos> my heart a living pyramid i raise <eos> and whilst kings ’ tombs with laurels flourish green <eos> thine shall with myrtles and these flowers be seen <eos>
surely thou seest , o spirit of light and fire <eos> surely thou canst not choose , o soul , but see <eos> the days whose dayspring was beheld of thee <eos> ere eyes less pure might have their hope 's desire <eos> beholding life in heaven again respire <eos> where men saw nought that was or was to be <eos> save only death imperial . thou and he <eos> who has the heart of all men 's hearts for lyre <eos> ye twain , being great of spirit as time is great <eos> and sure of sight as truth 's own heavenward eye <eos> beheld the forms of forces passing by <eos> and certitude of equal balanced fate <eos> whose breath forefelt makes darkness palpitate <eos> and knew that light should live and darkness die <eos>
lo , the poor indian ! whose untutored mind <eos> sees god in clouds , or hears him in the wind <eos> his soul , proud science never taught to stray <eos> far as the solar walk , or milky way <eos> yet simple nature to his hope has given <eos> behind the cloud topped hill , an humbler heaven <eos> some safer world in depths of woods embraced <eos> some happier island in the watery waste <eos> where slaves once more their native land behold <eos> no fiends torment , no christians thirst for gold <eos> to be , contents his natural desire <eos> he asks no angel 's wing , no seraph 's fire <eos> but thinks , admitted to that equal sky <eos> his faithful dog shall bear him company <eos>
these wonders strange be sees , and many more <eos> whose head is pregnant with poetic lore <eos> should he upon an evening ramble fare <eos> with forehead to the soothing breezes bare <eos> would he naught see but the dark , silent blue <eos> with all its diamonds trembling through and through <eos> or the coy moon , when in the waviness <eos> of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress <eos> and staidly paces higher up , and higher <eos> like a sweet nun in holy day attire <eos> ah , yes ! much more would start into his sight <eos> the revelries , and mysteries of night <eos> and should i ever see them , i will tell you <eos> such tales as needs must with amazement spell you <eos>
then welcome be it , if indeed it be <eos> the irrepressible conflict ! let it come <eos> there will be mitigation of the doom <eos> if , battling to the last , our sires shall see <eos> their sons contending for the homes made free <eos> in ancient conflict with the foreign foe <eos> if those who call us brethren strike the blow <eos> no common conflict shall the invader know <eos> war to the knife , and to the last , until <eos> the sacred land we keep shall overflow <eos> with blood as sacred — valley , wave , and hill <eos> or the last enemy finds his bloody grave <eos> aye , welcome to your graves — or ours ! the brave <eos> may perish , but ye shall not bind one slave <eos>
that thou hast her it is not all my grief <eos> and yet it may be said i loved her dearly <eos> that she hath thee is of my wailing chief <eos> a loss in love that touches me more nearly <eos> loving offenders thus i will excuse ye <eos> thou dost love her , because thou know'st i love her <eos> and for my sake even so doth she abuse me <eos> suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her <eos> if i lose thee , my loss is my love 's gain <eos> and losing her , my friend hath found that loss <eos> both find each other , and i lose both twain <eos> and both for my sake lay on me this cross <eos> but here 's the joy , my friend and i are one <eos> sweet flattery , then she loves but me alone <eos>
brown hills long parched , long lifting to the blue <eos> of summer 's brilliant sky but russet hue <eos> of sere grass shivering in the trade wind 's sweep <eos> soon , with light footfalls , from their tranced sleep <eos> the first rains bid the poppies rise anew <eos> and trills the lark exultant summons , too <eos> how swift at fancy 's beck those gay crowds leap <eos> to glowing life ! the eager green leaves creep <eos> for welcome first ; then hooded buds , pale gold <eos> each tender shower and sun kiss help unfold <eos> till smiling hosts crowd all the fields , and still <eos> a yellow sea of poppies breasts each hill <eos> and breaks in joyous floods as children hold <eos> glad hands the lavish cups as gladly fill <eos>
“ such be the plea , and by the plea deceive <eos> for jove infatuates all , and all believe <eos> yet leave for each of us a sword to wield <eos> a pointed javelin , and a fenceful shield <eos> but by my blood that in thy bosom glows <eos> by that regard a son his father owes <eos> the secret , that thy father lives , retain <eos> lock 'd in thy bosom from the household train <eos> hide it from all ; e'en from eumaeus hide <eos> from my dear father , and my dearer bride <eos> one care remains , to note the loyal few <eos> whose faith yet lasts among the menial crew <eos> and noting , ere we rise in vengeance , prove <eos> who love his prince ; for sure you merit love <eos>
king solomon , before his palace gate <eos> at evening , on the pavement tessellate <eos> was walking with a stranger from the east <eos> arrayed in rich attire as for a feast <eos> the mighty runjeet sing , a learned man <eos> and rajah of the realms of hindostan <eos> and as they walked the guest became aware <eos> of a white figure in the twilight air <eos> gazing intent , as one who with surprise <eos> his form and features seemed to recognize <eos> and in a whisper to the king he said <eos> “ what is yon shape , that , pallid as the dead <eos> is watching me , as if he sought to trace <eos> in the dim light the features of my face <eos>
the train ! the twelve o'clock for paradise <eos> hurry , or it will try to creep away <eos> out in the country every one is wise <eos> we can be only wise on saturday <eos> there you are waiting , little friendly house <eos> those are your chimney stacks with you between <eos> surrounded by old trees and strolling cows <eos> staring through all your windows at the green <eos> your homely floor is creaking for our tread <eos> the smiling tea pot with contented spout <eos> thinks of the boiling water , and the bread <eos> longs for the butter . all their hands are out <eos> to greet us , and the gentle blankets seem <eos> purring and crooning : ‘ lie in us , and dream <eos>
aisles and abysses ; leagues no man explores <eos> of rock that labyrinths and night that drips <eos> where everlasting silence broods , with lips <eos> of adamant , o'er earthquakehyppphenbuilded floors <eos> where forms , such as the demon world adores <eos> laborious water carves ; whence echo ships <eos> wild tongued o'er pools where petrifaction strips <eos> her breasts of crystal from which crystal pours <eos> here where primordial fear , the gorgon , sits <eos> staring all life to stone in ghastly mirth <eos> i seem to tread , with awe no tongue can tell <eos> beneath vast domes , by torrent tortured pits <eos> ‘ mid wrecks terrific of the ruined earth <eos> an ancient causeway of forgotten hell <eos>
is that a swan that rides upon the water <eos> o no , it is that other gentle bird <eos> which is the patron of our noble calling <eos> i well remember , in my early years <eos> when these young hands first closed upon a goose <eos> i have a scar upon my thimble finger <eos> which chronicles the hour of young ambition <eos> my father was a tailor , and his father <eos> and my sire 's grandsire , all of them were tailors <eos> they had an ancient goose ,— it was an heir loom <eos> from some remoter tailor of our race <eos> it happened i did see it on a time <eos> when none was near , and i did deal with it <eos> and it did burn me ,— oh , most fearfully <eos>
he spoke abrupt across my dream : “ dear garden <eos> a stranger to your magic peace , i stand <eos> beyond your walls , lost in a fevered land <eos> of stones and fire . would that the gods would harden <eos> my soul against its torment , or would blind <eos> those yearning glimpses of a life at rest <eos> in perfect beauty — glimpses at the best <eos> through unpassed bars . and here , without , the wind <eos> of scattering passion blows : and women pass <eos> glitter eyed down putrid alleys where the glass <eos> of some grimed window suddenly parades <eos> ah , sickening heart beat of desire !— the grace <eos> of bare and milk warm flesh : the vision fades <eos> and at the pane shows a blind tortured face <eos>
in fancy 's world an atlas have i been <eos> where yet the chaos of my ceaseless care <eos> is by her eyes unpitied and unseen <eos> in whom all gifts but pity planted are <eos> for mercy though still cries my moan clad muse <eos> and every paper that she sends to beauty <eos> in tract of sable tears brings woeful news <eos> of my true heart kind thoughts , and loyal duty <eos> but ah the strings of her hard heart are strained <eos> beyond the harmony of my desires <eos> and though the happy heavens themselves have pained <eos> to tame her heart whose will so far aspires <eos> yet she who claims the title of world 's wonder <eos> thinks all deserts too base to bring her under <eos>
mysterious night ! spread wide thy silvery plume <eos> soft as swan 's down , brood o'er the sapphirine <eos> breadth of still shadowy waters dark as wine <eos> smooth out the liquid heavens that stars illume <eos> come with fresh airs breathing the faint perfume <eos> of deep walled gardens , groves of whispering pine <eos> scatter soft dews , waft pure sea scent of brine <eos> in sweet repose man 's pain , man 's love resume <eos> deep bosomed night ! not here where down the marge <eos> marble with palaces those lamps of earth <eos> tremble on trembling blackness ; nay , far hence <eos> there on the lake where space is lone and large <eos> and man 's life lost in broad indifference <eos> lilt thou the soul to spheres that gave her birth <eos>
this said , within her anxious mind she weighs <eos> the means of cutting short her odious days <eos> then to sichaeus ’ nurse she briefly said <eos> ( for , when she left her country , hers was dead <eos> “ go , barce , call my sister . let her care <eos> the solemn rites of sacrifice prepare <eos> the sheep , and all th ’ atoning off'rings bring <eos> sprinkling her body from the crystal spring <eos> with living drops ; then let her come , and thou <eos> with sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow <eos> thus will i pay my vows to stygian jove <eos> and end the cares of my disastrous love <eos> then cast the trojan image on the fire <eos> and , as that burns , my passions shall expire <eos>
when shall i see the white thorn leaves agen <eos> and yellowhammers gathering the dry bents <eos> by the dyke side , on stilly moor or fen <eos> feathered with love and nature 's good intents <eos> rude is the tent this architect invents <eos> rural the place , with cart ruts by dyke side <eos> dead grass , horse hair , and downy headed bents <eos> tied to dead thistles — she doth well provide <eos> close to a hill of ants where cowslips bloom <eos> and shed oer meadows far their sweet perfume <eos> in early spring , when winds blow chilly cold <eos> the yellowhammer , trailing grass , will come <eos> to fix a place and choose an early home <eos> with yellow breast and head of solid gold <eos>
no sooner youth throws off his infant plays <eos> the harmless pastime of his happier days <eos> but past a child , is still in judgement so <eos> and studies first what he is not to know <eos> pleasure and sence his easie soul entice <eos> spurr 'd forward by his native love to vice <eos> a mistress now his fancy entertains <eos> and youthful vigour boils within his brains <eos> the poor lost maid he do 's with oaths intice <eos> and loads his soul with twenty thousand lyes <eos> promises marriage , love , a hundred things <eos> till both himself and her , he to destruction brings <eos> at length he finds his falsity repaid <eos> and draws the curse of heaven on his head <eos>
i ioy to see how , in your drawen work <eos> your selfe unto the bee ye doe compare <eos> and me unto the spyder , that doth lurke <eos> in close awayt , to catch her unaware <eos> right so your selfe were caught in cunning snare <eos> of a deare foe , and thralled to his love <eos> in whose streight bands ye now captived are <eos> so firmely , that ye never may remove <eos> but as your worke is woven all about <eos> with woodbynd flowers and fragrant eglantine <eos> so sweet your prison you in time shall prove <eos> with many deare delights bedecked fyne <eos> and all thensforth eternall peace shall see <eos> betweene the spyder and the gentle bee <eos>
ah whither , poor forsaken , wilt thou go <eos> to go from sorrow and thine own distress <eos> when every place presents like face of woe <eos> and no remove can make thy sorrows less <eos> yet go , forsaken ! leave these woods , these plains <eos> leave her and all , and all for her that leaves <eos> thee and thy love forlorn , and both disdains <eos> and of both wrongful deems and ill conceives <eos> seek out some place , and see if any place <eos> can give the least release unto thy grief <eos> convey thee from the thought of thy disgrace <eos> steal from thyself and be thy cares ’ own thief <eos> but yet what comforts shall i hereby gain <eos> bearing the wound , i needs must feel the pain <eos>
for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any <eos> who for thy self art so unprovident <eos> grant if thou wilt , thou art beloved of many <eos> but that thou none lov'st is most evident <eos> for thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate <eos> that ‘ gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire <eos> seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate <eos> which to repair should be thy chief desire <eos> o change thy thought , that i may change my mind <eos> shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love <eos> be as thy presence is gracious and kind <eos> or to thy self at least kind hearted prove <eos> make thee another self for love of me <eos> that beauty still may live in thine or thee <eos>
thus labour 'd they amid the stubborn fight <eos> but of tydides none might say to whom <eos> his arm belong 'd , or whether with the hosts <eos> of troy or greece he mingled in the fight <eos> hither and thither o'er the plain he rush 'd <eos> like to a wintry stream , that brimming o'er <eos> breaks down its barriers in its rapid course <eos> nor well built bridge can stem the flood , nor fence <eos> guards the fertile fields , as down it pours <eos> its sudden torrent , swoll'n with rain from heav'n <eos> and many a goodly work of man destroys <eos> so back were borne before tydides ’ might <eos> the serried ranks of troy , nor dar 'd await <eos> despite their numbers , his impetuous charge <eos>
how do i keep thee ? let me count the ways <eos> i bar up every breadth and depth and height <eos> my hands can reach , while feeling out of sight <eos> for bolts that stick and hasps that will not raise <eos> i keep thee from the public 's idle gaze <eos> i keep thee in , by sun or candle light <eos> i keep thee , rude , as women strive for right <eos> i keep thee boldly , as they seek for praise <eos> i keep thee with more effort than i 'd use <eos> to keep a dry goods shop or big hotel <eos> i keep thee with a power i seemed to lose <eos> with that last cook . i 'll keep thee down the well <eos> or up the chimney place ! or if i choose <eos> i shall but keep thee in a pumpkin shell <eos>
army reserve ; a worshipper of bobs <eos> with whom he stripped the smock from candahar <eos> neat as his mount , that neatest among cobs <eos> whenever pageants pass , or meetings are <eos> he moves conspicuous , vigilant , severe <eos> with his light cavalry hand and seat and look <eos> a living type of order , in whose sphere <eos> is room for neither hooligan nor hook <eos> for in his shadow , wheresoe'er he ride <eos> paces , all eye and hardihood and grip <eos> the dreaded crusher , might in his every stride <eos> and right materialized girt at his hip <eos> and they , that shake to see these twain go by <eos> feel that the tec , that plain clothes terror , is nigh <eos>
yes , pile the marble o'er him ! it is well <eos> that ye who mocked him in his long stern strife <eos> and planted in the pathway of his life <eos> the ploughshares of your hatred hot from hell <eos> who clamored down the bold reformer when <eos> he pleaded for his captive fellow men <eos> who spurned him in the market place , and sought <eos> within thy walls , st. tammany , to bind <eos> in party chains the free and honest thought <eos> the angel utterance of an upright mind <eos> well is it now that o'er his grave ye raise <eos> the stony tribute of your tardy praise <eos> for not alone that pile shall tell to fame <eos> of the brave heart beneath , but of the builders ’ shame <eos>
this bronze doth keep the very form and mold <eos> of our great martyr 's face . yes , this is he <eos> that brow all wisdom , all benignity <eos> that human , humorous mouth ; those cheeks that hold <eos> like some harsh landscape all the summer 's gold <eos> that spirit fit for sorrow , as the sea <eos> for storms to beat on ; the lone agony <eos> those silent , patient lips too well foretold <eos> yes , this is he who ruled a world of men <eos> as might some prophet of the elder day <eos> brooding above the tempest and the fray <eos> with deep eyed thought and more than mortal ken <eos> a power was his beyond the touch of art <eos> or arm è d strength : his pure and mighty heart <eos>
k áú s , the king , now joins the mournful chief <eos> and tries to soothe his deep and settled grief <eos> for soon or late we yield our vital breath <eos> and all our worldly troubles end in death <eos> “ when first i saw him , graceful in his might <eos> he looked far other than a tartar knight <eos> wondering i gazed — now destiny has thrown <eos> him on thy sword — he fought , and he is gone <eos> and should even heaven against the earth be hurled <eos> or fire inwrap in crackling flames the world <eos> that which is past — we never can restore <eos> his soul has travelled to some happier shore <eos> alas ! no good from sorrow canst thou reap <eos> then wherefore thus in gloom and misery weep <eos>
at last , so faire a ladie did i spie <eos> that thinking yet on her i burne and quake <eos> on hearbs and flowres she walked pensively <eos> milde , but yet love she proudly did forsake <eos> white seem 'd her robes , yet woven so they were <eos> as snow and golde together had been wrought <eos> above the wast a darke clowde shrouded her <eos> a stinging serpent by the heele her caught <eos> wherewith she languisht as the gathered floure <eos> and , well assur 'd , she mounted up to ioy <eos> alas ! on earth so nothing doth endure <eos> but bitter griefe and sorrowfull annoy <eos> which make this life wretched and miserable <eos> tossed with stormes of fortune variable <eos>
woe to the sceptic in these party days <eos> who wafts to neither shrine his puffs of praise <eos> for him no pension pours its annual fruits <eos> no fertile sinecure spontaneous shoots <eos> not his the meed that crowned don hookham 's rhyme <eos> nor sees he e'er in dreams of future time <eos> those shadowy forms of sleek reversions rise <eos> so dear to scotchmen 's second sighted eyes <eos> yet who that looks to history 's damning leaf <eos> where whig and tory , thief opposed to thief <eos> on either side in lofty shame are seen <eos> while freedom 's form lies crucified between <eos> who , burdett , who such rival rogues can see <eos> but flies from both to honesty and thee <eos>
he should have followed who goes forth before us <eos> last born of us in life , in death first born <eos> the last to lift up eyes against the morn <eos> the first to see the sunset . life , that bore us <eos> perchance for death to comfort and restore us <eos> of him hath left us here awhile forlorn <eos> for him is as a garment overworn <eos> and time and change , with suns and stars in chorus <eos> silent . but if , beyond all change or time <eos> a law more just , more equal , more sublime <eos> than sways the surge of life 's loud sterile sea <eos> sways that still world whose peace environs him <eos> where death lies dead as night when stars wax dim <eos> above all thought or hope of ours is he <eos>

ah ! once again the long left wires among <eos> truants the muse to weave her requiem song <eos> with sterner lore now busied , erst the lay <eos> cheer 'd my dark morn of manhood , wont to stray <eos> o'er fancy 's fields in quest of musky flower <eos> to me nor fragrant less , though barr 'd from view <eos> and courtship of the world : hail 'd was the hour <eos> that gave me , dripping fresh with nature 's dew <eos> poor henry 's budding beauties — to a clime <eos> hapless transplanted , whose exotic ray <eos> forced their young vigour into transient day <eos> and drain 'd the stalk that rear 'd them ! and shall time <eos> trample these orphan blossoms ?— no ! they breathe <eos> still lovelier charms — for southey culls the wreath <eos>

when comes the lighted day for men to read <eos> life 's meaning , with the work before their hands <eos> till this good gift of breath from debt is freed <eos> earth will not hear her children 's wailful bands <eos> deplore the chieftain fall'n in sob and dirge <eos> nor they look where is darkness , but on high <eos> the sun that dropped down our horizon 's verge <eos> illumes his labours through the travelled sky <eos> now seen in sum , most glorious ; and ‘ tis known <eos> by what our warrior wrought we hold him fast <eos> a splendid image built of man has flown <eos> his deeds inspired of god outstep a past <eos> ours the great privilege to have had one <eos> among us who celestial tasks has done <eos>

lo , i awhile the story of the saint <eos> the song of praise of him who did the deeds <eos> have set forth here in words , a tale well known <eos> beyond my power ; much is there yet to tell <eos> a weary task — what he in life endured <eos> from the beginning on ! a wiser man <eos> upon the earth than i account myself <eos> must in his heart invent it , one who knows <eos> from the beginning all the misery <eos> which bravely he endured in cruel wars <eos> yet in small parts we further must relate <eos> a portion of that tale . it has been told <eos> already how he suffered many woes <eos> from grievous warfare in the heathen town <eos>
hear what the desolate rizpah said <eos> as on gibeah 's rocks she watched the dead <eos> the sons of michal before her lay <eos> and her own fair children , dearer than they <eos> by a death of shame they all had died <eos> and were stretched on the bare rock , side by side <eos> and rizpah , once the loveliest of all <eos> that bloomed and smiled in the court of saul <eos> all wasted with watching and famine now <eos> and scorched by the sun her haggard brow <eos> sat mournfully guarding their corpses there <eos> and murmured a strange and solemn air <eos> the low , heart broken , and wailing strain <eos> of a mother that mourns her children slain <eos>

home from her convent to the palace came <eos> the lovely princess emma , whose sweet name <eos> whispered by seneschal or sung by bard <eos> had often touched the soul of eginhard <eos> he saw her from his window , as in state <eos> she came , by knights attended through the gate <eos> he saw her at the banquet of that day <eos> fresh as the morn , and beautiful as may <eos> he saw her in the garden , as she strayed <eos> among the flowers of summer with her maid <eos> and said to him , “ o eginhard , disclose <eos> the meaning and the mystery of the rose <eos> and trembling he made answer : “ in good sooth <eos> its mystery is love , its meaning youth <eos>
to day , all day , i rode upon the down <eos> with hounds and horsemen , a brave company <eos> on this side in its glory lay the sea <eos> on that the sussex weald , a sea of brown <eos> the wind was light , and brightly the sun shone <eos> and still we galloped on from gorse to gorse <eos> and once , when checked , a thrush sang , and my horse <eos> pricked his quick ears as to a sound unknown <eos> i knew the spring was come . i knew it even <eos> better than all by this , that through my chase <eos> in bush and stone and hill and sea and heaven <eos> i seemed to see and follow still your face <eos> your face my quarry was . for it i rode <eos> my horse a thing of wings , myself a god <eos>

how blest is he who knows no meaner strife <eos> than art 's long battle with the foes of life <eos> no doubt assails him , doing still his best <eos> and trusting kindly nature for the rest <eos> no mocking conscience tears the thin disguise <eos> that wraps his breast , and tells him that he lies <eos> he comes : the languid sufferer lifts his head <eos> and smiles a welcome from his weary bed <eos> he speaks : what music like the tones that tell <eos> “ past is the hour of danger ,— all is well <eos> how can he feel the petty stings of grief <eos> whose cheering presence always brings relief <eos> what ugly dreams can trouble his repose <eos> who yields himself to soothe another 's woes <eos>
where fair ææ ia smiles across the sea <eos> to olive crowned italia , th ’ enchantress dwells <eos> a woman set about with dreams and spells <eos> weird incantations , charms and mystery <eos> most strangely pale and strangely fair is she <eos> yet deadlier than the hemlock draught her smile <eos> darker than stygian glooms her subtle guile <eos> drawn by her deep eyes ’ spell , across the sea <eos> the argive galleys wing , till beached they lie <eos> upon the fatal strand . the greeks beguile <eos> the hasting hours with revelry and wine <eos> within her halls .... eftsoon strange sorcery <eos> the circe weaves . they who were men erewhile <eos> now grovel at her feet , transformed to swine <eos>
passing i saw her as she stood beside <eos> a lonely stream between two barren wolds <eos> her loose vest hung in rudely gathered folds <eos> on her swart bosom , which in maiden pride <eos> pillowed a string of pearls ; among her hair <eos> twined the light bluebell and the stone crop gay <eos> and not far thence the small encampment lay <eos> curling its wreathed smoke into the air <eos> she seemed a child of some sun favored clime <eos> so still , so habited to warmth and rest <eos> and in my wayward musings on past time <eos> when my thought fills with treasured memories <eos> that image nearest borders on the blest <eos> creations of pure art that never dies <eos>
you 're no adulterer :— nor a thief am i <eos> when i see plate and wisely pass it by <eos> but take away the danger , in a trice <eos> nature unbridled plunges into vice <eos> what ? you to be my master , who obey <eos> more persons , nay , more things than words can say <eos> whom not the praetor 's wand , though four times waved <eos> could make less tyrant ridden , less enslaved <eos> press home the matter further : how d'ye call <eos> the thrall who 's servant to another thrall <eos> an understrapper , say ; the name will do <eos> or fellow servant : such am i to you <eos> for you , whose work i do , do others ’ work <eos> and move as dolls move when their wires we jerk <eos>
that time was come , or seem 'd as it was come <eos> when death no longer makes the grave his home <eos> when waking spirits leave their earthly rest <eos> to mix for ever with the damn 'd or blest <eos> when years , in drowsy thousands counted by <eos> are hung on minutes with their destiny <eos> when time in terror drops his draining glass <eos> and all things mortal , like to shadows , pass <eos> as ‘ neath approaching tempests sinks the sun <eos> when time shall leave eternity begun <eos> life swoon 'd in terror at that hour 's dread birth <eos> as in an ague , shook the fearful earth <eos> and shuddering nature seemed herself to shun <eos> whilst trembling conscience felt the deed was done <eos>
there 's not a budding boy , or girl , this day <eos> but is got up , and gone to bring in may <eos> a deal of youth , ere this , is come <eos> back , and with white thorn laden home <eos> some have dispatch 'd their cakes and cream <eos> before that we have left to dream <eos> and some have wept , and woo 'd , and plighted troth <eos> and chose their priest , ere we can cast off sloth <eos> many a green gown has been given <eos> many a kiss , both odd and even <eos> many a glance , too , has been sent <eos> from out the eye , love 's firmament <eos> many a jest told of the keys betraying <eos> this night , and locks pick 'd :— yet we 're not a maying <eos>
in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes <eos> for they in thee a thousand errors note <eos> but ‘ tis my heart that loves what they despise <eos> who in despite of view is pleased to dote <eos> nor are mine cars with thy tongue 's tune delighted <eos> nor tender feeling to base touches prone <eos> nor taste , nor smell , desire to be invited <eos> to any sensual feast with thee alone <eos> but my five wits , nor my five senses can <eos> dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee <eos> who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man <eos> thy proud heart 's slave and vassal wretch to be <eos> only my plague thus far i count my gain <eos> that she that makes me sin , awards me pain <eos>
hesper again his heavenly power display 'd <eos> and shook the yielding canopy of shade <eos> sudden the stars their trembling fires withdrew <eos> returning splendors burst upon the view <eos> floods of unfolding light the skies adorn <eos> and more than midday glories grace the morn <eos> so shone the earth , as if the sideral train <eos> broad as full suns , had sail 'd the ethereal plain <eos> when no distinguisht orb could strike the sight <eos> but one clear blaze of all surrounding light <eos> o'erflow ' d the vault of heaven . for now in view <eos> remoter climes and future ages drew <eos> whose deeds of happier fame , in long array <eos> call 'd into vision , fill the newborn day <eos>
why thus unjustly , say , my cruel fate <eos> dost thou adjudge my luckless eyes and heart <eos> the one to live exiled from that sweet smart <eos> where th ’ other pines , imprisoned without date <eos> my luckless eyes must never more debate <eos> of those bright beams that eased my love apart <eos> and yet my heart , bound to them with love 's dart <eos> must there dwell ever to bemoan my state <eos> o had mine eyes been suffered there to rest <eos> often they had my heart 's unquiet eased <eos> or had my heart with banishment been blest <eos> mine eye with beauty never had been pleased <eos> but since these cross effects hath fortune wrought <eos> dwell , heart , with her ; eyes , view her in my thought <eos>
when thou shalt be disposed to set me light <eos> and place my merit in the eye of scorn <eos> upon thy side , against my self i 'll fight <eos> and prove thee virtuous , though thou art forsworn <eos> with mine own weakness being best acquainted <eos> upon thy part i can set down a story <eos> of faults concealed , wherein i am attainted <eos> that thou in losing me , shalt win much glory <eos> and i by this will be a gainer too <eos> for bending all my loving thoughts on thee <eos> the injuries that to my self i do <eos> doing thee vantage , double vantage me <eos> such is my love , to thee i so belong <eos> that for thy right , my self will bear all wrong <eos>

night is the true democracy . when day <eos> like some great monarch with his train has passed <eos> in regal pomp and splendor to the last <eos> the stars troop forth along the milky way <eos> a jostling crowd , in radiant disarray <eos> on heaven 's broad boulevard in pageants vast <eos> and things of earth , the hunted and outcast <eos> come from their haunts and hiding places ; yea <eos> even from the nooks and crannies of the mind <eos> visions uncouth and vagrant fancies start <eos> and specters of dead joy , that shun the light <eos> and impotent regrets and terrors blind <eos> each one , in form grotesque , playing its part <eos> in the fantastic mardi gras of night <eos>
i stood upon the stone where ela lay <eos> the widowed founder of these ancient walls <eos> where fancy still on meek devotion calls <eos> marking the ivied arch , and turret gray <eos> for her soul 's rest — eternal rest — to pray <eos> where visionary nuns yet seem to tread <eos> a pale dim troop , the cloisters of the dead <eos> though twice three hundred years have flown away <eos> but when , with silent step and pensive mien <eos> in weeds , as mourning for her sisters gone <eos> the mistress of this lone monastic scene <eos> came ; and i heard her voice 's tender tone <eos> i said , though centuries have rolled between <eos> one gentle , beauteous nun is left , on earth , alone <eos>

ah , god ! the world needs many hours to make <eos> nor hast thou ceased the making of it yet <eos> but wilt be working on when death hath set <eos> a new mound in some churchyard for my sake <eos> on flow the centuries without a break <eos> uprise the mountains , ages without let <eos> the mosses suck the rock 's breast , rarely wet <eos> years more than past , the young earth yet will take <eos> but in the dumbness of the rolling time <eos> no veil of silence will encompass me <eos> thou wilt not once forget , and let me be <eos> i easier think that thou , as i my rhyme <eos> wouldst rise , and with a tenderness sublime <eos> unfold a world , that i , thy child , might see <eos>
raising my hopes on hills of high desire <eos> thinking to scale the heaven of her heart <eos> my slender means presumed too high a part <eos> her thunder of disdain forced me retire <eos> and threw me down to pain in all this fire <eos> where lo , i languish in so heavy smart <eos> because th'attempt was far above my art <eos> her pride brooked not poor souls should come so nigh her <eos> yet , i protest , my high desiring will <eos> was not to dispossess her of her right <eos> her sovereignty should have remain è d still <eos> i only sought the bliss to have her sight <eos> her sight , contented thus to see me spill <eos> framed my desires fit for her eyes to kill <eos>
a path , old tree , goes by thee crooking on <eos> and through this little gate that claps and bangs <eos> against thy rifted trunk , what steps hath gone <eos> though but a lonely way , yet mystery hangs <eos> oer crowds of pastoral scenes recordless here <eos> the boy might climb the nest in thy young boughs <eos> that 's slept half an eternity ; in fear <eos> the herdsman may have left his startled cows <eos> for shelter when heaven 's thunder voice was near <eos> here too the woodman on his wallet laid <eos> for pillow may have slept an hour away <eos> and poet pastoral , lover of the shade <eos> here sat and mused half some long summer day <eos> while some old shepherd listened to the lay <eos>
what better tale could any lover tell <eos> when age or death his reckoning shall write <eos> than thus , ‘ love taught me only to rebel <eos> against these things ,— the thieving of delight <eos> without return ; the gospellers of fear <eos> who , loving , yet deny the truth they bear <eos> sad suited lusts with lecherous hands to smear <eos> the cloth of gold they would but dare not wear <eos> and love gave me great knowledge of the trees <eos> and singing birds , and earth with all her flowers <eos> wisdom i knew and righteousness in these <eos> i lived in their atonement all my hours <eos> love taught me how to beauty 's eye alone <eos> the secret of the lying heart is known <eos>

a frame which may be that of hercules <eos> it hath such giant members ! and its port <eos> is martial as e'er marked a caesar 's moving <eos> its sandals are of brass , its massive brow <eos> is helmeted in steel , and in its hand <eos> it bears a sword with which , in idle strokes <eos> it vainly beats the unresisting air <eos> as if in battle with some phantom foe <eos> and at each blow it deals , a strong fatality <eos> turns back its sword 's keen point on its own breast <eos> which deep it gashes ,— then in mournful tone <eos> it mutters o'er and o'er again these words <eos> “ i fought for fame and won unending wo <eos> his agonies seem like himself , immortal <eos>
insect or blossom ? fragile , fairy thing <eos> poised upon slender tip , and quivering <eos> to flight ! a flower of the fields of air <eos> a jeweled moth ; a butterfly , with rare <eos> and tender tints upon his downy wings <eos> a moment resting in our happy sight <eos> a flower held captive by a thread so slight <eos> its petal wings of broidered gossamer <eos> are light as the wind , with every wind astir <eos> wafting sweet odor , faint and exquisite <eos> o dainty nursling of the field and sky <eos> what fairer thing looks up to heaven 's blue <eos> and drinks the noontide sun , the dawning 's dew <eos> thou winged bloom ! thou blossom butterfly <eos>
a giant sentinel , alone it stands <eos> on rocky headland where the breakers roar <eos> parted from piny woods and pebbled shore <eos> holding out branches as imploring hands <eos> poor lonely tree , where never bird doth make <eos> its nest , or sing at morn and eve to thee <eos> nor in whose shadow wild rose calleth bee <eos> to come on gauzy wing for love 's sweet sake <eos> nature cares for thee , gives thee sunshine gold <eos> handfuls of pearls cast from the crested waves <eos> for thee pink throated shells soft murmurs hold <eos> and seaweed vested chorists chant in caves <eos> whence came thee , lone one of an alien band <eos> to guard an outpost of this sunset land <eos>
‘ twas but a moment , for that respect <eos> which clothes all courage their voices checked <eos> and something the wildest could understand <eos> spake in the old man 's strong right hand <eos> and his corded throat , and the lurking frown <eos> of his eyebrows under his old bell crown <eos> until , as they gazed , there crept an awe <eos> through the ranks in whispers , and some men saw <eos> in the antique vestments and long white hair <eos> the past of the nation in battle there <eos> and some of the soldiers since declare <eos> that the gleam of his old white hat afar <eos> like the crested plume of the brave navarre <eos> that day was their oriflamme of war <eos>
i christened you in happier days , before <eos> these gray forebodings on my brow were seen <eos> you are still lovely in your new leaved green <eos> the brimming river soothes his grassy shore <eos> the bridge is there ; the rock with lichens hoar <eos> and the same shadows on the water lean <eos> outlasting us . how many graves between <eos> that day and this ! how many shadows more <eos> darken my heart , their substance from these eyes <eos> hidden forever ! so our world is made <eos> of life and death commingled ; and the sighs <eos> outweigh the smiles , in equal balance laid <eos> what compensation ? none , save that the allwise <eos> so schools us to love things that cannot fade <eos>
maiden , when such a soul as thine is born <eos> the morning stars their ancient music make <eos> and , joyful , once again their song awake <eos> long silent now with melancholy scorn <eos> and thou , not mindless of so blest a morn <eos> by no least deed its harmony shalt break <eos> but shalt to that high chime thy footsteps take <eos> through life 's most darksome passes unforlorn <eos> therefore from thy pure faith thou shalt not fall <eos> therefore shalt thou be ever fair and free <eos> and in thine every motion musical <eos> as summer air , majestic as the sea <eos> a mystery to those who creep and crawl <eos> through time , and part it from eternity <eos>
projectiles , music , and the sculptor 's art <eos> his chestnut whistle and his shingle dart <eos> his elder pop gun with its hickory rod <eos> its sharp explosion and rebounding wad <eos> his corn stalk fiddle , and the deeper tone <eos> that murmurs from his pumpkin stalk trombone <eos> conspire to teach the boy . to these succeed <eos> his bow , his arrow of a feathered reed <eos> his windmill , raised the passing breeze to win <eos> his water wheel , that turns upon a pin <eos> or , if his father lives upon the shore <eos> you 'll see his ship , “ beam ends upon the floor <eos> full rigged , with raking masts , and timbers stanch <eos> and waiting , near the wash tub , for a launch <eos>
six thousand years of commune , god with man <eos> two thousand years of ohrist ; yet from such roots <eos> immortal , earth reaps only bitterest fruits <eos> the fiends rage now as when they first began <eos> hate , lust , greed , vanity , triumphant still <eos> yell , shout , exult , and lord o'er human will <eos> the sun moves back ! the fond convictions felt <eos> that , in the progress of the race , we stood <eos> two thousand years of height above the flood <eos> before the day 's experience sink and melt <eos> as frost beneath the fire ! and what remains <eos> of all our grand ideals and great gains <eos> with goth , hun , vandal , warring in their pride <eos> while the meek christ is hourly crucified <eos>
she entered as the holy monk desired <eos> and they together to his cell retired <eos> the friar on the bed this maiden threw <eos> a kiss would take :— she from him rather drew <eos> and said .— to give one wit is this the way <eos> yes , answered he , and round her ‘ gan to play <eos> upon her bosom then he put his hand <eos> what now , said she , am i to understand <eos> is this the way ?— said he , ‘ tis so decreed <eos> then patiently she let the monk proceed <eos> who followed up , from point to point , his aim <eos> and wit , by easy steps , advancing came <eos> till its progression with her was complete <eos> then alice laughed , success appeared so sweet <eos>
immortal eloquence of mystic art <eos> how strangely o'er oblivion and gray time <eos> that hand doth speak , as in the painter 's prime <eos> it uttered thus his own and mary 's heart <eos> at sight of it , what rich conjectures start <eos> adown the years , what wistful aves chime <eos> that wake the soul to rapture how sublime <eos> wherewith we , too , must bear in him our part <eos> for unto each to bring redemption 's share <eos> whereby adown the ages christ is borne <eos> there comes the angel of the lilied rod <eos> and though our souls with anguish sore are torn <eos> we pray once more the world o'ercoming prayer <eos> and then is born in us the word of god <eos>
that lady of all gentle memories <eos> had lighted on my soul ; whose new abode <eos> lies now , as it was well ordained of god <eos> among the poor in heart where mary is <eos> love , knowing that dear image to be his <eos> woke up within the sick heart sorrow bowed <eos> unto the sighs which are its weary load <eos> saying , “ go forth . ” and they went forth , i wis <eos> forth went they from my breast that throbbed and ached <eos> with such a pang as oftentimes will bathe <eos> mine eyes with tears when i am left alone <eos> and still those sighs which drew the heaviest breath <eos> came whispering thus : “ o noble intellect <eos> it is a year to day that thou art gone <eos>
in florence once there dwelled a gentle youth <eos> who loved a certain beauteous belle with truth <eos> o'er all his actions she had full controul <eos> to please he would have sold his very soul <eos> if she amusements wished , he 'd lavish gold <eos> convinced in love or war you should be bold <eos> the cash ne'er spare :— invincible its pow'rs <eos> o'erturning walls or doors where'er it show'rs <eos> the precious ore can every thing o'ercome <eos> ‘ twill silence barking curs : make servants dumb <eos> and these can render eloquent at will <eos> excel e'en tully in persuasive skill <eos> in short he 'd leave no quarter unsubdued <eos> unless therein the fair he could include <eos>
they dub thee idler , smiling sneeringly <eos> and why ? because , forsooth , so many moons <eos> here dwelling voiceless by the voiceful sea <eos> thou hast not set thy thoughts to paltry tunes <eos> in song or sonnet . them these golden noons <eos> oppress not with their beauty ; they could prate <eos> even while a prophet read the solemn runes <eos> on which is hanging some imperial fate <eos> how know they , these good gossips , what to thee <eos> the ocean and its wanderers may have brought <eos> how know they , in their busy vacancy <eos> with what far aim thy spirit may be fraught <eos> or that thou dost not bow thee silently <eos> before some great unutterable thought <eos>
the same which pyrrhus and the puissaunce <eos> of afrike could not tame , that same brave citie <eos> which , with stout courage arm 'd against mischaunce <eos> sustein 'd the shocke of common enmitie <eos> long as her ship , tost with so manie freakes <eos> had all the world in armes against her bent <eos> was never seene that anie fortunes wreakes <eos> could breake her course begun with brave intent <eos> but , when the obiect of her vertue failed <eos> her power it selfe against it selfe did arme <eos> as he that having long in tempest sailed <eos> faine would arive , but cannot for the storme <eos> if too great winde against the port him drive <eos> doth in the port it selfe his vessell rive <eos>
but the rest fired the tents , wherein erewhile <eos> they slept , and sailed the wide sea in their ships <eos> two mighty hearted captains ordered these <eos> nestor and agamemnon lord of spears <eos> fain had they also entered that great horse <eos> but all the host withheld them , bidding stay <eos> with them a shipboard , ordering their array <eos> for men far better work the works of war <eos> when their kings oversee them ; therefore these <eos> abode without , albeit mighty men <eos> so came they swiftly unto tenedos ’ shore <eos> and dropped the anchor stones , then leapt in haste <eos> forth of the ships , and silent waited there <eos> keen watching till the signal torch should flash <eos>
low , low down in the violets i press <eos> my lips and whisper to her . does she hear <eos> and yet hold silence , though i call her dear <eos> just as of old , save for the tearfulness <eos> of the clenched eyes , and the soul 's vast distress <eos> has she forgotten thus the old caress <eos> that made our breath a quickened atmosphere <eos> that failed nigh unto swooning with the sheer <eos> delight ? mine arms clutch now this earthen heap <eos> sodden with tears that flow on ceaselessly <eos> as autumn rains the long , long , long nights weep <eos> in memory of days that used to be <eos> has she forgotten these ? and in her sleep <eos> has she forgotten me — forgotten me <eos>
brother !— our eldest , first born from the dead <eos> of all the glorified the living head <eos> yet condescending to the youngest child <eos> with tenderest looks and accents sweet and mild <eos> who feels a wrong done to the feeblest one <eos> keenly , as though unto himself ‘ twere done <eos> who , sees no kindness to the humblest shown <eos> but ‘ lisas though ‘ twere to himself alone <eos> and who will judge the wrong , the kindness bless <eos> with all a brother 's truth and tenderness <eos> nay , more : an earthly brother faints and dies <eos> or faithless oft , forgets affections ties <eos> his love , enduring as the eternal throne <eos> no change , decay , or loss have ever known <eos>
god give us men ; a time like this demands <eos> strong minds , great hearts , true faith and ready hands <eos> men whom the lust of office cannot kill <eos> men whom the spoils of office cannot buy <eos> men who possess opinions and a will <eos> men who have honor ; men who will not lie <eos> men who can stand before a demagogue <eos> and brave his treacherous flatteries without winking <eos> tall men , sun crowned , who live above the fog <eos> in public duty and in private thinking <eos> for while the rabble , with its thumb worn creeds <eos> its large professions , and its little deeds <eos> mingle in selfish strife — lo ! freedom weeps <eos> wrong rules the land , and waiting justice sleeps <eos>
no otherwise than raynie cloud , first fed <eos> with earthly vapours gathered in the ayre <eos> eftsoones in compas arch't , to steepe his hed <eos> doth plonge himselfe in tethys bosome faire <eos> and , mounting up againe from whence he came <eos> with his great bellie spreds the dimmed world <eos> till at the last , dissolving his moist frame <eos> in raine , or snowe , or haile , he forth is horld <eos> this citie , which was first but shepheards shade <eos> uprising by degrees , grewe to such height <eos> that queene of land and sea her selfe she made <eos> at last , not able to beare so great weight <eos> her power , disperst , through all the world did vade <eos> to shew that all in th'end to nought shall fade <eos>
why , thou being changeless , changeful did i write <eos> trusting thy truth , yet doubting thy defect <eos> now all triumphant , now confounded quite <eos> sad suited all , or proud in purple deck 'd <eos> did i not write of thy rare constancy <eos> wherein was none like thee , thou like to none <eos> swear that thy heart within my heart did lie <eos> past all removal till the world were done <eos> e'en so ; but though , when clouds the region hold <eos> masking with envious murk the sun 's bright face <eos> our o'ergloom ' d spirits shudder ‘ neath the cold <eos> he merits not the blame of that disgrace <eos> himself is still the same , still warm , still bright <eos> though clouds between hide both the warmth and light <eos>
oft and in vain my rebel thoughts have ventured <eos> to stop the passage of my vanquished heart <eos> and shut those ways my friendly foe first entered <eos> hoping thereby to free my better part <eos> and whilst i guard the windows of this fort <eos> where my heart 's thief to vex me made her choice <eos> and thither all my forces do transport <eos> another passage opens at her voice <eos> her voice betrays me to her hand and eye <eos> my freedom 's tyrant , conquering all by art <eos> but ah ! what glory can she get thereby <eos> with three such powers to plague one silly heart <eos> yet my soul 's sovereign , since i must resign <eos> reign in my thoughts , my love and life are thine <eos>
then we asked was there anything <eos> up attic that we 'd ever want again <eos> the attic was less to us than the cellar <eos> if the bones liked the attic , let them like it <eos> let them stay in the attic . when they sometimes <eos> come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed <eos> behind the door and headboard of the bed <eos> brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers <eos> with sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter <eos> that 's what i sit up in the dark to say <eos> to no one any more since toffile died <eos> let them stay in the attic since they went there <eos> i promised toffile to be cruel to them <eos> for helping them be cruel once to him <eos>
the other two , slight air , and purging fire <eos> are both with thee , wherever i abide <eos> the first my thought , the other my desire <eos> these present absent with swift motion slide <eos> for when these quicker elements are gone <eos> in tender embassy of love to thee <eos> my life being made of four , with two alone <eos> sinks down to death , oppressed with melancholy <eos> until life 's composition be recured <eos> by those swift messengers returned from thee <eos> who even but now come back again assured <eos> of thy fair health , recounting it to me <eos> this told , i joy , but then no longer glad <eos> i send them back again and straight grow sad <eos>
so saying , he strode on , kunti 's strong son <eos> and bhima ; and arjuna followed him <eos> and nakalu and the hound ; leaving behind <eos> sahadev in the sands . but nakalu <eos> weakened and grieved to see sahadev fall <eos> his dear loved brother — lagged and stayed ; and then <eos> prone on his face he fell , that noble face <eos> which had no match for beauty in the land <eos> glorious and godlike nakalu ! then sighed <eos> bhima anew : “ brother and lord ! the man <eos> who never erred from virtue , never broke <eos> our fellowship , and never in the world <eos> was matched for goodly perfectness of form <eos> or gracious feature ,— nakalu has fallen <eos>
it one day happened , that this forward spark <eos> the girl we speak of , met within the park <eos> and to a summer house the fav'rite drew <eos> the course they took the princess chanced to view <eos> as wand'ring near ; but neither swain nor fair <eos> suspicion had , that any one was there <eos> and this gallant most confidently thought <eos> the girl by force , might to his terms be brought <eos> his wretched temper , obstacle to love <eos> and ev'ry bliss bestowed by heav'n above <eos> had oft his hopes of favours lately marred <eos> and fear , with those designs , had also jarred <eos> the girl , howe'er , would likely have been kind <eos> if opportunities had pleased her mind <eos>
man was not made for forms , but forms for man <eos> and there are times when law itself must bend <eos> to that clear spirit always in the van <eos> outspeeding human justice . in the end <eos> potentates , not humanity , must fall <eos> water will find its level , fire will burn <eos> the winds must blow around the earthly ball <eos> the earthly ball by day and night must turn <eos> freedom is typed in every element <eos> man must be free , if not through law , why then <eos> above the law , until its force be spent <eos> and justice brings a better . but , o , when <eos> father of light , when shall the reckoning come <eos> to lift the weak , and strike the oppressor dumb <eos>
since dark december shrouds the transient day <eos> and stormy winds are howling in their ire <eos> why com'st not thou , who always can'st inspire <eos> the soul of cheerfulness , and best array <eos> a sullen hour in smiles ?— o haste to pay <eos> the cordial visit sullen hours require <eos> around the circling walls a glowing fire <eos> shines ;— but it vainly shines in this delay <eos> to blend thy spirit 's warm promethean light <eos> come then , at science ’ , and at friendship 's call <eos> their vow 'd disciple ;— come , for they invite <eos> the social powers without thee languish all <eos> come , that i may not hear the winds of night <eos> nor count the heavy eave drops as they fall <eos>
thou radiant coachman , running endless course <eos> fountain of heat , of light the lively source <eos> life of the world , lamp of this universe <eos> heaven 's richest gem : oh , teach me where my verse <eos> may but begin thy praise : alas ! i fare <eos> much like to one that in the clouds doth stare <eos> to count the quails , that with their shadow cover <eos> the italian sea , when soaring hither over <eos> fain of a milder and more fruitful clime <eos> they come with us to pass the summer time <eos> no sooner he begins one shoal to sum <eos> but , more and more , still greater shoals do come <eos> swarm upon swarm , that with their countless number <eos> break off his purpose , and his sense encumber <eos>
yet , after peace has turned the clean white page <eos> there shall be sorrow on the earth for years <eos> abysmal grief , that has no eyes for tears <eos> and youth that hobbles through the earth like age <eos> but better to play this part upon life 's stage <eos> than to aid structures that a tyrant rears <eos> to live a stalwart hireling torn with fears <eos> and shamed by feeding on a conqueror s wage <eos> death , yea , a thousand deaths , were sweet in truth <eos> rather than such ignoble life . god gave <eos> being , and breath , and high resolve to youth <eos> that it might be wrong 's master , not its slave <eos> our road to freedom is the road to guns <eos> go , arm your sons ! i say , go , arm your sons <eos>
has she forgotten ? on this very may <eos> we were to meet here , with the birds and bees <eos> as on that sabbath , underneath the trees <eos> we strayed among the tombs , and stripped away <eos> the vines from these old granites , cold and gray <eos> and yet indeed not grim enough were they <eos> to stay our kisses , smiles and ecstasies <eos> or closer voice lost vows and rhapsodies <eos> has she forgotten — that the may has won <eos> its promise ?— that the bird songs from the tree <eos> are sprayed above the grasses as the sun <eos> might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly <eos> has she forgotten life — love — everyone <eos> has she forgotten me — forgotten me <eos>
the world has no such flower in any land <eos> and no such pearl in any gulf the sea <eos> as any babe on any mother 's knee <eos> but all things blessed of men by saints are banned <eos> god gives them grace to read and understand <eos> the palimpsest of evil , writ where we <eos> poor fools and lovers but of love , can see <eos> nought save a blessing signed by love 's own hand <eos> the smile that opens heaven on us for them <eos> hath sin 's transmitted birthmark hid therein <eos> the kiss it craves calls down from heaven a rod <eos> if innocence be sin that gods condemn <eos> praise we the men who so being born in sin <eos> first dared the doom and broke the bonds of god <eos>
slowly the hour hand of the clock moves round <eos> so slowly that no human eye hath power <eos> to see it move ! slowly in shine or shower <eos> the painted ship above it , homeward bound <eos> sails , but seems motionless , as if aground <eos> yet both arrive at last ; and in his tower <eos> the slumberous watchman wakes and strikes the hour <eos> a mellow , measured , melancholy sound <eos> midnight ! the outpost of advancing day <eos> the frontier town and citadel of night <eos> the watershed of time , from which the streams <eos> of yesterday and to morrow take their way <eos> one to the land of promise and of light <eos> one to the land of darkness and of dreams <eos>
there 's nothing i know of to make you spend <eos> a day of your life at cragwell end <eos> it 's a village quiet and grey and old <eos> a little village tucked into a fold <eos> ( a sort of valley , not over wide <eos> of the hills that flank it on either side <eos> there 's a large grey church with a square stone tower <eos> and a clock to mark you the passing hour <eos> in a chime that shivers the village calm <eos> with a few odd bits of the 100th psalm <eos> a red brick vicarage stands thereby <eos> breathing comfort and lapped in ease <eos> with a row of elms thick trunked and high <eos> and a bevy of rooks to caw in these <eos>
‘ oft , when the world imagine women stray <eos> the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way <eos> through all the giddy circle they pursue <eos> and old impertinence expel by new <eos> what tender maid but must a victim fall <eos> to one man 's treat , but for another 's ball <eos> when florio speaks , what virgin could withstand <eos> if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand <eos> with varying vanities , from every part <eos> they shift the moving toyshop of their heart <eos> where wigs with wigs , with sword knots sword knots strive <eos> beaux banish beaux , and coaches coaches drive <eos> this erring mortals levity may call <eos> oh , blind to truth ! the sylphs contrive it all <eos>
the nodding oxeye bends before the wind <eos> the woodbine quakes lest boys their flowers should find <eos> and prickly dogrose spite of its array <eos> ca n't dare the blossom seeking hand away <eos> while thistles wear their heavy knobs of bloom <eos> proud as a warhorse wears its haughty plume <eos> and by the roadside danger 's self defy <eos> on commons where pined sheep and oxen lie <eos> in ruddy pomp and ever thronging mood <eos> it stands and spreads like danger in a wood <eos> and in the village street where meanest weeds <eos> ca n't stand untouched to fill their husks with seeds <eos> the haughty thistle oer all danger towers <eos> in every place the very wasp of flowers <eos>
guarded within the old red wall 's embrace <eos> marshalled like soldiers in gay company <eos> the tulips stand arrayed . here infantry <eos> wheels out into the sunlight . what bold grace <eos> sets off their tunics , white with crimson lace <eos> here are platoons of gold frocked cavalry <eos> with scarlet sabres tossing in the eye <eos> of purple batteries , every gun in place <eos> forward they come , with flaunting colours spread <eos> with torches burning , stepping out in time <eos> to some quick , unheard march . our ears are dead <eos> we cannot catch the tune . in pantomime <eos> parades that army . with our utmost powers <eos> we hear the wind stream through a bed of flowers <eos>
his friends , for sure they well that title claim <eos> first thought the licence of his tongue to blame <eos> but , when they mark 'd how deeply he was mov 'd <eos> they sooth 'd and cherish 'd rather than reprov 'd <eos> each day , as mute he sat in desperate grief <eos> they spoke kind words of comfort and relief <eos> each day , howe'er they sought , howe'er they sued <eos> scarce might they win his lips to taste of food <eos> ‘ come , welcome death ! ’ forever was his cry <eos> ‘ lo , here a wretch who wishes but to die <eos> so still he wail 'd , till woe such mastery wan <eos> they trembled for his nobler powers of man <eos> they fear 'd lest reason 's tottering rule should end <eos> and to a moping ideot sink their friend <eos>
iii . heav'n from all creatures hides the book of fate <eos> all but the page prescrib 'd , their present state <eos> from brutes what men , from men what spirits know <eos> or who could suffer being here below <eos> the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day <eos> had he thy reason , would he skip and play <eos> pleas 'd to the last , he crops the flow'ry food <eos> and licks the hand just rais 'd to shed his blood <eos> oh blindness to the future ! kindly giv'n <eos> that each may fill the circle mark 'd by heav'n <eos> who sees with equal eye , as god of all <eos> a hero perish , or a sparrow fall <eos> atoms or systems into ruin hurl 'd <eos> and now a bubble burst , and now a world <eos>
then let good nature every charm exert <eos> and while it mends it , win th ’ unfolding heart <eos> let moral mirth a face of triumph wear <eos> yet smile unconscious of th ’ extorted tear <eos> see with what grace instructive satire flows <eos> politely keen , in olio 's numbered prose <eos> that great example should our zeal excite <eos> and censors learn from addison to write <eos> so , in our age , too prone to sport with pain <eos> might soft humanity resume her reign <eos> pride without rancour feel th ’ objected fault <eos> and folly blush , as willing to be taught <eos> critics grow mild , life 's witty warfare cease <eos> and true good nature breathe the balm of peace <eos>
here is the place where loveliness keeps house <eos> between the river and the wooded hills <eos> within a valley where the springtime spills <eos> her firstling wind flowers under blossoming boughs <eos> where summer sits braiding her warm , white brows <eos> with bramble roses ; and where autumn fills <eos> her lap with asters ; and old winter frills <eos> with crimson haw and hip his snowy blouse <eos> here you may meet with beauty . here she sits <eos> gazing upon the moon , or all the day <eos> tuning a wood thrush flute , remote , unseen <eos> or when the storm is out , ‘ tis she who flits <eos> from rock to rock , a form of flying spray <eos> shouting , beneath the leaves ’ tumultuous green <eos>
a gentle shepherd , born in arcady <eos> that well could tune his pipe , and deftly play <eos> the nymphs asleep with rural minstrelsy <eos> methought i saw , upon a summer 's day <eos> take up a little satyr in a wood <eos> all masterless forlorn as none did know him <eos> and nursing him with those of his own blood <eos> on mighty pan he lastly did bestow him <eos> but with the god he long time had not been <eos> ere he the shepherd and himself forgot <eos> and most ingrateful , ever stepp 'd between <eos> pan and all good befell the poor man 's lot <eos> whereat all good men griev 'd , and strongly swore <eos> they never would be foster fathers more <eos>
ye patriot crowds , who burn for england 's fame <eos> ye nymphs , whose bosoms beat at milton 's name <eos> whose generous zeal , unbought by flattering rhymes <eos> shames the mean pensions of augustan times <eos> immortal patrons of succeeding days <eos> attend this prelude of perpetual praise <eos> let wit , condemn 'd the feeble war to wage <eos> with close malevolence , or public rage <eos> let study , worn with virtue 's fruitless lore <eos> behold this theatre , and grieve no more <eos> this night , distinguish 'd by your smiles , shall tell <eos> that never briton can in vain excel <eos> the slightest arts futurity shall trust <eos> and rising ages hasten to be just <eos>
grant , fairest kind , a kiss unto thy friend <eos> a blush replied , and yet a kiss i had <eos> it is not heaven that can such nectar send <eos> whereat my senses all amazed were glad <eos> this done , she fled as one that was affrayed <eos> and i desired to kiss by kissing more <eos> my love she frowned , and i my kissing stayed <eos> yet wished to kiss her as i did before <eos> then as the vine the propping elm doth clasp <eos> loath to depart till both together die <eos> so fold me , sweet , until my latest gasp <eos> that in thy arms to death i kissed may lie <eos> thus whilst i live for kisses i must call <eos> still kiss me , sweet , or kiss me not at all <eos>
immense , august , like some titanic bloom <eos> the mighty choir unfolds its lithic core <eos> petalled with panes of azure , gules and or <eos> splendidly lambent in the gothic gloom <eos> and stamened with keen flamelets that illume <eos> the pale high altar . on the prayer worn floor <eos> by worshippers innumerous thronged of yore <eos> a few brown crones , familiars of the tomb <eos> the stranded driftwood of faith 's ebbing sea <eos> for these alone the finials fret the skies <eos> the topmost bosses shake their blossoms free <eos> while from the triple portals , with grave eyes <eos> tranquil , and fixed upon eternity <eos> the cloud of witnesses still testifies <eos>
like a beautiful face looking ever at me <eos> a pure bright moon cometh over the sea <eos> and i stand on the crags , and hear the falls <eos> go tumbling down , through the black river walls <eos> and the heart of the gorge is rent with the cry <eos> of the pent up winds in their agony <eos> you are far from me , dear , where i watch and wait <eos> like a weary bird for a long lost mate <eos> and my life is as dull as the sluggish stream <eos> feeling its way through a world of dream <eos> for here is a waste of darkness and fear <eos> and i call and i call , but no one will hear <eos> o darling of mine , do you ever yearn <eos> for a something lost , which will never return <eos>

and now a shadow and a terror fell <eos> on the great house , as if a passing bell <eos> tolled from the tower , and filled each spacious room <eos> with secret awe , and preternatural gloom <eos> the petted boy grew ill , and day by day <eos> pined with mysterious malady away <eos> the mother 's heart would not be comforted <eos> her darling seemed to her already dead <eos> and often , sitting by the sufferer 's side <eos> “ what can i do to comfort thee ? ” she cried <eos> at first the silent lips made no reply <eos> but , moved at length by her importunate cry <eos> “ give me , ” he answered , with imploring tone <eos> “ ser federigo 's falcon for my own <eos>
when i had chosen on the river 's edge <eos> such station , that the distance of the stream <eos> alone did separate me ; there i stay 'd <eos> my steps for clearer prospect , and beheld <eos> the flames go onward , leaving , as they went <eos> the air behind them painted as with trail <eos> of liveliest pencils ! so distinct were mark 'd <eos> all those sev'n listed colours , whence the sun <eos> maketh his bow , and cynthia her zone <eos> these streaming gonfalons did flow beyond <eos> my vision ; and ten paces , as i guess <eos> parted the outermost . beneath a sky <eos> so beautiful , came foul and twenty elders <eos> by two and two , with flower de luces crown 'd <eos>

since i left you , mine eye is in my mind <eos> and that which governs me to go about <eos> doth part his function , and is partly blind <eos> seems seeing , but effectually is out <eos> for it no form delivers to the heart <eos> of bird , of flower , or shape which it doth latch <eos> of his quick objects hath the mind no part <eos> nor his own vision holds what it doth catch <eos> for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight <eos> the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature <eos> the mountain , or the sea , the day , or night <eos> the crow , or dove , it shapes them to your feature <eos> incapable of more , replete with you <eos> my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue <eos>
in florence once there dwelled a gentle youth <eos> who loved a certain beauteous belle with truth <eos> o'er all his actions she had full controul <eos> to please he would have sold his very soul <eos> if she amusements wished , he 'd lavish gold <eos> convinced in love or war you should be bold <eos> the cash ne'er spare :— invincible its pow'rs <eos> o'erturning walls or doors where'er it show'rs <eos> the precious ore can every thing o'ercome <eos> ‘ twill silence barking curs : make servants dumb <eos> and these can render eloquent at will <eos> excel e'en tully in persuasive skill <eos> in short he 'd leave no quarter unsubdued <eos> unless therein the fair he could include <eos>
‘ twas in a land unkempt of life 's red dawn <eos> where in his sanded cave he dwelt alone <eos> sleeping by day , or sometimes worked upon <eos> his flint head arrows and his knives of stone <eos> by night stole forth and slew the savage boar <eos> so that he loomed a hunter of loud fame <eos> and many a skin of wolf and wild cat wore <eos> and counted many a flint head to his name <eos> wherefore he walked the envy of the band <eos> hated and feared , but matchless in his skill <eos> till lo ! one night deep in that shaggy land <eos> he tracked a yearling bear and made his kill <eos> then over worn he rested by a stream <eos> and sank into a sleep too deep for dream <eos>

i wandered through scoglietto 's far retreat <eos> the oranges on each o'erhanging spray <eos> burned as bright lamps of gold to shame the day <eos> some startled bird with fluttering wings and fleet <eos> made snow of all the blossoms ; at my feet <eos> like silver moons the pale narcissi lay <eos> and the curved waves that streaked the great green bay <eos> laughed i ’ the sun , and life seemed very sweet <eos> outside the young boy priest passed singing clear <eos> ‘ jesus the son of mary has been slain <eos> o come and fill his sepulchre with flowers <eos> ah , god ! ah , god ! those dear hellenic hours <eos> had drowned all memory of thy bitter pain <eos> the cross , the crown , the soldiers and the spear <eos>
the crystal stream wherein my love did swim <eos> melted in tears as partners of my woe <eos> her shine was such as did the fountain dim <eos> the pearl like fountain whiter than the snow <eos> then like perfume , resolv è d with a heat <eos> the fountain smoked , as if it thought to burn <eos> a wonder strange to see the cold so great <eos> and yet the fountain into smoke to turn <eos> i searched the cause , and found it to be this <eos> she touched the water , and it burned with love <eos> now by her means it purchased hath that bliss <eos> which all diseases quickly can remove <eos> then if by you these streams thus bless è d be <eos> sweet , grant me love , and be not worse to me <eos>

thee had we followed through the twilight land <eos> where thought grows form , and matter is refined <eos> back into thought of the eternal mind <eos> till , seeing them one , lo , in the morn we stand <eos> then started fresh and followed , hand in hand <eos> with sense divinely growing , till , combined <eos> we heard the music of the planets wind <eos> in harmony with billows on the strand <eos> till , one with earth and all god 's utterance <eos> we hardly knew whether the sun outspake <eos> or a glad sunshine from our spirits brake <eos> whether we think , or winds and blossoms dance <eos> alas , o poet leader , for such good <eos> thou wast god 's tragedy , writ in tears and blood <eos>

lo in the orient when the gracious light <eos> lifts up his burning head , each under eye <eos> doth homage to his new appearing sight <eos> serving with looks his sacred majesty <eos> and having climbed the steep up heavenly hill <eos> resembling strong youth in his middle age <eos> yet mortal looks adore his beauty still <eos> attending on his golden pilgrimage <eos> but when from highmost pitch with weary car <eos> like feeble age he reeleth from the day <eos> the eyes ( fore duteous ) now converted are <eos> from his low tract and look another way <eos> so thou , thy self out going in thy noon <eos> unlooked on diest unless thou get a son <eos>

a ladder , which my ken pursued in vain <eos> so lofty was the summit ; down whose steps <eos> i saw the splendours in such multitude <eos> descending , ev'ry light in heav'n , methought <eos> was shed thence . as the rooks , at dawn of day <eos> bestirring them to dry their feathers chill <eos> some speed their way a field , and homeward some <eos> returning , cross their flight , while some abide <eos> and wheel around their airy lodge ; so seem 'd <eos> that glitterance , wafted on alternate wing <eos> as upon certain stair it met , and clash 'd <eos> its shining . and one ling'ring near us , wax 'd <eos> so bright , that in my thought : said : “ the love <eos> which this betokens me , admits no doubt <eos>
month after month in widowhood of soul <eos> drooping the maiden saw two summers roll <eos> their suns away — but , ah , how cold and dim <eos> even summer suns when not beheld with him <eos> from time to time ill omened rumors came <eos> like spirit tongues muttering the sick man 's name <eos> just ere he dies :— at length those sounds of dread <eos> fell withering on her soul , “ azim is dead <eos> oh grief beyond all other griefs when fate <eos> first leaves the young heart lone and desolate <eos> in the wide world without that only tie <eos> for which it loved to live or feared to die <eos> lorn as the hung up lute , that near hath spoken <eos> since the sad day its master chord was broken <eos>

she gave up beauty in her tender youth <eos> gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways <eos> she covered up her eyes lest they should gaze <eos> on vanity , and chose the bitter truth <eos> harsh towards herself , towards others full of ruth <eos> servant of servants , little known to praise <eos> long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days <eos> she schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth <eos> that with the poor and stricken she might make <eos> a home , until the least of all sufficed <eos> her wants ; her own self learned she to forsake <eos> counting all earthly gain but hurt and loss <eos> so with calm will she chose and bore the cross <eos> and hated all for love of jesus christ <eos>
at length the awful revelation came <eos> crushing at once his pride of birth and name <eos> the hopes his yearning bosom forward cast <eos> and the ancestral glories of the vast <eos> all fell together , crumbling in disgrace <eos> a turret rent from battlement to base <eos> his daughters talking in the dead of night <eos> in their own chamber , and without a light <eos> listening , as he was wont , he overheard <eos> and learned the dreadful secret , word by word <eos> and hurrying from his castle , with a cry <eos> he raised his hands to the unpitying sky <eos> repeating one dread word , till bush and tree <eos> caught it , and shuddering answered , “ heresy <eos>

many the wonders i this day have seen <eos> the sun , when first he kist away the tears <eos> that fill 'd the eyes of morn ;— the laurel 'd peers <eos> who from the feathery gold of evening lean <eos> the ocean with its vastness , its blue green <eos> its ships , its rocks , its caves , its hopes , its fears <eos> its voice mysterious , which whoso hears <eos> must think on what will be , and what has been <eos> e'en now , dear george , while this for you i write <eos> cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping <eos> so scantly , that it seems her bridal night <eos> and she her half discover 'd revels keeping <eos> but what , without the social thought of thee <eos> would be the wonders of the sky and sea <eos>
how well this man unfolded to our view <eos> the world 's beliefs of death and heaven and hell <eos> this man whose own convictions none could tell <eos> nor if his maze of reason had a clew <eos> dogmas he wrote for daily bread , but knew <eos> the fair philosophies of doubt so well <eos> that while we listened to his words there fell <eos> some that were strangely comforting , though true <eos> marking how wise we grew upon his doubt <eos> we said : “ if so , by groping in the night <eos> he can proclaim some certain paths of trust <eos> how great our profit if he saw about <eos> his feet the highways leading to the light <eos> now he sees all . ah , christ ! his mouth is dust <eos>

now is the blackest hour of the long night <eos> the soul of midnight . now , the pallid stars <eos> shine in the highest silver and the wind <eos> that creepeth chill across the sleeping world <eos> holdeth no hint of morning . i look out <eos> into the glory of the night with tired <eos> wide , sleepless eyes and think of you . there is <eos> the hush of some great spirit o'er the earth <eos> here , in the silence earth and sky are met <eos> and merged into infinity . oh , god <eos> of all , thou who beholdest destiny <eos> as simple , thou who understandest life <eos> from birth to re birth , who knows all our souls <eos> grant her thy perfect benediction , rest <eos>

she blessed them , and with voices lifted up <eos> in loud lament the dregs of sorrow 's cup <eos> they drained together . orpah , weeping , turned <eos> and slowly went , but ruth with eyes that yearned <eos> into naomi 's , cried aloud in pain <eos> “ thus to forsake thee , urge me not again <eos> nor to return from following after thee <eos> for where thou goest , i will surely go <eos> and where thou lodgest , will i lodge also <eos> thy people shall be my people evermore <eos> and thy god only will i now adore <eos> and where thou diest , i will buried be <eos> so may jehovah strike me with his thunder <eos> if aught but only death our lives shall sunder <eos>
down the strait vistas where a city street <eos> fades in pale dust and vaporous distances <eos> stained with far fumes the light grows less and less <eos> and the sky reddens round the day 's retreat <eos> now out of orient chambers , cool and sweet <eos> like nature 's pure lustration , dusk comes down <eos> now the lamps brighten and the quickening town <eos> rings with the trample of returning feet <eos> and pleasure , risen from her own warm mould <eos> sunk all the drowsy and unloved daylight <eos> in layers of odorous softness , paphian girls <eos> cover with gauze , with satin , and with pearls <eos> crown , and about her spangly vestments fold <eos> the ermine of the empire of the night <eos>

take down thy stars , o god ! we look not up <eos> in vain thou hangest there thy changeless sign <eos> we lift our eyes to power 's glowing cup <eos> nor care if blood make strong that wizard wine <eos> so we but drink and feel the sorcery <eos> of conquest in our veins , of wits grown keen <eos> in strain and strife for flesh sweet sovereignty <eos> the fatal thrill of kingship over men <eos> what though the soul be from the body shrunk <eos> and we array the temple , but no god <eos> what though , the cup of golden greed once drunk <eos> our dust be laid in a dishonoured sod <eos> while thy loud hosts proclaim the end of wars <eos> we read no sign . o god , take down thy stars <eos>
the tablet of my heavy fortunes here <eos> upon thine altar , paphian power , i place <eos> the grievous shipwreck of my travels dear <eos> in bulg è d bark , all perished in disgrace <eos> that traitor love was pilot to my woe <eos> my sails were hope , spread with my sighs of grief <eos> the twin lights which my hapless course did show <eos> hard by th'inconstant sands of false relief <eos> were two bright stars which led my view apart <eos> a siren 's voice allured me come so near <eos> to perish on the marble of her heart <eos> a danger which my soul did never fear <eos> lo , thus he fares that trusts a calm too much <eos> and thus fare i whose credit hath been such <eos>
six thousand veterans practis 'd in war 's game <eos> tried men , at killicranky were array 'd <eos> against an equal host that wore the plaid <eos> shepherds and herdsmen .— like a whirlwind came <eos> the highlanders , the slaughter spread like flame <eos> and garry thundering down his mountain road <eos> was stopp 'd , and could not breathe beneath the load <eos> of the dead bodies . ‘ twas a day of shame <eos> for them whom precept and the pedantry <eos> of cold mechanic battle do enslave <eos> oh ! for a single hour of that dundee <eos> who on that day the word of onset gave <eos> like conquest would the men of england see <eos> and her foes find a like inglorious grave <eos>
she starts , with eyes upturn 'd and fleeting breath <eos> in their raised axes views her instant death <eos> spreads her white hands to heaven in frantic prayer <eos> then runs to grasp their knees , and crouches there <eos> her hair , half lost along the shrubs she past <eos> rolls in loose tangles round her lovely waist <eos> her kerchief torn betrays the globes of snow <eos> that heave responsive to her weight of woe <eos> does all this eloquence suspend the knife <eos> does no superior bribe contest her life <eos> there does : the scalps by british gold are paid <eos> a long hair 'd scalp adorns that heavenly head <eos> arid comes the sacred spoil from friend or foe <eos> no marks distinguish , and no man can know <eos>
all that is perfect , which th'heaven beautefies <eos> all that 's imperfect , borne belowe the moone <eos> all that doth feede our spirits and our eies <eos> and all that doth consume our pleasures soone <eos> all the mishap the which our daies outweares <eos> all the good hap of th'oldest times afore <eos> rome , in the time of her great ancesters <eos> like a pandora , locked long in store <eos> but destinie this huge chaos turmoyling <eos> in which all good and evill was enclosed <eos> their heavenly vertues from these woes assoyling <eos> caried to heaven , from sinfull bondage losed <eos> but their great sinnes , the causers of their paine <eos> under these antique ruines yet remaine <eos>
thou in whose all no work imperfect stands <eos> thou who dost gaze on beauty 's unveiled face <eos> grant to thy children thy sustaining grace <eos> when low at length have run the daylight sands <eos> when , though their day was set to thy commands <eos> they bow contritely in prayer 's holy place <eos> because through strivings beauty wards they trace <eos> the sad misshapings of their earthly hands <eos> grant them at eve a soul devoutly still <eos> grant them in dreams a vision of thy light <eos> grant them at morn a sorrow purged away <eos> into the peace of all absolving night <eos> star in the dawnlight of a fairer day <eos> nearer the blossom of thy perfect will <eos>
after so long a race as i have run <eos> through faery land , which those six books compile <eos> give leave to rest me being half foredonne <eos> and gather to my selfe new breath awhile <eos> then , as a steed refreshed after toyle <eos> out of my prison i will break anew <eos> and stoutly will that second work assoyle <eos> with strong endevour and attention dew <eos> till then give leave to me in pleasant mew <eos> to sport my muse , and sing my loves sweet praise <eos> the contemplation of whose heavenly hew <eos> my spirit to an higher pitch will rayse <eos> but let her prayses yet be low and meane <eos> fit for the handmayd of the faery queene <eos>
and as the loving servant weeping stood <eos> loath to awake her to her evil doom <eos> she opened her large violet eyes , and gazed <eos> upon the morning sunlight stealing in <eos> the clear light trembling , growing on the wall <eos> and as she looked , her eyes grew like the eyes <eos> of blessed angels looking on their lord <eos> and high toward heaven she lifted up her hands <eos> then clasped them in content upon her breast <eos> and cried out in a glad voice , “ oh , my heart <eos> and with such glory lighting up her face <eos> as if the flood of joy had filled her heart <eos> and overrun her lips with blissful smiles <eos> she left the world , and saved her sire from shame <eos>
lift up thy light on us and on thine own <eos> o soul whose spirit on earth was as a rod <eos> to scourge off priests , a sword to pierce their god <eos> a staff for man 's free thought to walk alone <eos> a lamp to lead him far from shrine and throne <eos> on ways untrodden where his fathers trod <eos> ere earth 's heart withered at a high priest 's nod <eos> and all men 's mouths that made not prayer made moan <eos> from bonds and torments and the ravening flame <eos> surely thy spirit of sense rose up to greet <eos> lucretius , where such only spirits meet <eos> and walk with him apart till shelley came <eos> to make the heaven of heavens more heavenly sweet <eos> and mix with yours a third incorporate name <eos>
through the sweet vales a quire of damsels sing <eos> eternall p æ ans to their king <eos> the stars with sparkling light stand round i see <eos> twinkling to their shrill melodie <eos> her and her tender darling , then i spy <eos> i ’ th ’ mid ’ st of that blest company <eos> with looks more fresh and sweet , then are the roses <eos> of which her garlands shee composes <eos> two flowry chaplets , which with gems set round <eos> her owne and nephew ’ s temples crown ’ d <eos> but here a veyle was drawne , i must not prie <eos> nor search too farre with mortall eye <eos> nor would you more . it may suffice that shee <eos> hath chang ’ d fraile flesh for blest eternitie <eos>
it hath been heretofore my chance to see <eos> horsemen with martial order shifting camp <eos> to onset sallying , or in muster rang 'd <eos> or in retreat sometimes outstretch 'd for flight <eos> light armed squadrons and fleet foragers <eos> scouring thy plains , arezzo ! have i seen <eos> and clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts <eos> now with the sound of trumpets , now of bells <eos> tabors , or signals made from castled heights <eos> and with inventions multiform , our own <eos> or introduc 'd from foreign land ; but ne'er <eos> to such a strange recorder i beheld <eos> in evolution moving , horse nor foot <eos> nor ship , that tack 'd by sign from land or star <eos>
hark ! how the bitter winter breezes blow <eos> round the sharp rocks and o'er the half lifted wave <eos> while all the rocky woodland branches rave <eos> shrill with the piercing cold , and every cave <eos> along the icy water margin low <eos> rings bubbling with the whirling overflow <eos> and sharp the echoes answer distant cries <eos> of dawning daylight and the dim sunrise <eos> and the gloom coloured clouds that stain the skies <eos> with pictures of a warmth , and frozen glow <eos> spread over endless fields of sheeted snow <eos> and white untrodden mountains shining cold <eos> and muffled footpaths winding thro ’ the wold <eos> o'er which those wintry gusts cease not to howl and blow <eos>
shall the hag evil die with the child of good <eos> or propagate again her loath è d kind <eos> thronging the cells of the diseased mind <eos> hateful with hanging cheeks , a withered brood <eos> though hourly pastured on the salient blood <eos> oh ! that the wind which bloweth cold or heat <eos> would shatter and o'erbear the brazen beat <eos> of their broad vans , and in the solitude <eos> of middle space confound them , and blow back <eos> their wild cries down their cavernthroats , and slake <eos> with points of blastborne hail their heated eyne <eos> so their wan limbs no more might come between <eos> the moon and the moon 's reflex in the night <eos> nor blot with floating shades the solar light <eos>
“ chi é costui , che in si gran pietra scolto <eos> siede gigante , e le pi ù illustri , e conte <eos> opre dell ’ arte avanza , e ha vive , e pronte <eos> le labbra si , che le parole ascolto <eos> quest ’ è mos è; ben me ‘ l diceva il folto <eos> onor del mento , e ‘ l doppio raggio in fronte <eos> quest ’ è mos è, quando scendea dal monte <eos> e gran parte del nume avea nel volto <eos> tal ’ era allor , che le sonanti , e vaste <eos> acque ei sospese , a se d ’ intorno ; e tale <eos> quando il mar chiuse , e ne f è tomba altrui <eos> e voi , sue turbe , un rio vitello alzaste <eos> alzata aveste immago a questa eguale <eos> ch ’ era men fallo i ’ adorar costui <eos>
i thought our love at full , but i did err <eos> joy 's wreath drooped o'er mine eyes ; i could not see <eos> that sorrow in our happy world must be <eos> love 's deepest spokesman and interpreter <eos> but , as a mother feels her child first stir <eos> under her heart , so felt i instantly <eos> deep in my soul another bond to thee <eos> thrill with that life we saw depart from her <eos> o mother of our angel child ! twice dear <eos> death knits as well as parts , and still , i wis <eos> her tender radiance shall infold us here <eos> even as the light , borne up by inward bliss <eos> threads the void glooms of space without a fear <eos> to print on farthest stars her pitying kiss <eos>
“ i , if i perish , perish ” — esther spake <eos> and bride of life or death she made her fair <eos> in all the lustre of her perfumed hair <eos> and smiles that kindle longing but to slake <eos> she put on pomp of loveliness , to take <eos> her husband through his eyes at unaware <eos> she spread abroad her beauty for a snare <eos> harmless as doves and subtle as a snake <eos> she trapped him with one mesh of silken hair <eos> she vanquished him by wisdom of her wit <eos> and built her people 's house that it should stand <eos> if i might take my life so in my hand <eos> and for my love to love put up my prayer <eos> and for love 's sake by love be granted it <eos>
to whom the godlike paris thus replied <eos> “ hector , since blameless i incur thy blame <eos> ne'er have i less withdrawn me from the fight <eos> and me not wholly vile my mother bore <eos> for since thou gav'st command to attack the ships <eos> we here against the greeks unflinching war <eos> have wag 'd ; our comrades , whom thou seek'st , are slain <eos> only deiphobus hath left the field <eos> and helenus ; both wounded by the spear <eos> both through the hand ; but jove their life hath spar 'd <eos> but thou , where'er thy courage bids , lead on <eos> we shall be prompt to follow ; to our pow'r <eos> thou shalt in us no lack of valour find <eos> beyond his pow'r the bravest cannot fight <eos>
while the long night extends her sable reign <eos> around patroclus mourn ’ d the grecian train <eos> stern in superior grief pelides stood <eos> those slaughtering arms , so used to bathe in blood <eos> now clasp his clay cold limbs : then gushing start <eos> the tears , and sighs burst from his swelling heart <eos> the lion thus , with dreadful anguish stung <eos> roars through the desert , and demands his young <eos> when the grim savage , to his rifled den <eos> too late returning , snuffs the track of men <eos> and o ’ er the vales and o ’ er the forest bounds <eos> his clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds <eos> so grieves achilles ; and , impetuous , vents <eos> to all his myrmidons his loud laments <eos>
then arthur rose and lancelot follow 'd him <eos> and while they stood without the doors , the king <eos> turn 'd to him saying , “ is it then so well <eos> or mine the blame that oft i seem as he <eos> of whom was written , ‘ a sound is in his ears <eos> the foot that loiters , bidden go ,— the glance <eos> that only seems half loyal to command <eos> a manner somewhat fall'n from reverence <eos> or have i dream 'd the bearing of our knights <eos> tells of a manhood ever less and lower <eos> or whence the fear lest this my realm , uprear 'd <eos> by noble deeds at one with noble vows <eos> from flat confusion and brute violences <eos> reel back into the beast , and be no more <eos>
love is too young to know what conscience is <eos> yet who knows not conscience is born of love <eos> then gentle cheater urge not my amiss <eos> lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove <eos> for thou betraying me , i do betray <eos> my nobler part to my gross body 's treason <eos> my soul doth tell my body that he may <eos> triumph in love , flesh stays no farther reason <eos> but rising at thy name doth point out thee <eos> as his triumphant prize , proud of this pride <eos> he is contented thy poor drudge to be <eos> to stand in thy affairs , fall by thy side <eos> no want of conscience hold it that i call <eos> her love , for whose dear love i rise and fall <eos>
restore thy tresses to the golden ore <eos> yield cytherea 's son those arks of love <eos> bequeath the heavens the stars that i adore <eos> and to the orient do thy pearls remove <eos> yield thy hands ’ pride unto the ivory white <eos> t'arabian odours give thy breathing sweet <eos> restore thy blush unto aurora bright <eos> to thetis give the honour of thy feet <eos> let venus have the graces she resigned <eos> and thy sweet voice give back unto the spheres <eos> but yet restore thy fierce and cruel mind <eos> to hyrcan tigers and to ruthless bears <eos> yield to the marble thy hard heart again <eos> so shalt thou cease to plague , and i to pain <eos>
as sheep , that step from forth their fold , by one <eos> or pairs , or three at once ; meanwhile the rest <eos> stand fearfully , bending the eye and nose <eos> to ground , and what the foremost does , that do <eos> the others , gath'ring round her , if she stops <eos> simple and quiet , nor the cause discern <eos> so saw i moving to advance the first <eos> who of that fortunate crew were at the head <eos> of modest mien and graceful in their gait <eos> when they before me had beheld the light <eos> from my right side fall broken on the ground <eos> so that the shadow reach 'd the cave , they stopp 'd <eos> and somewhat back retir 'd : the same did all <eos> who follow 'd , though unweeting of the cause <eos>
when among creatures fair of countenance <eos> love comes enformed in such proud character <eos> so far as other beauty yields to her <eos> so far the breast with fiercer longing pants <eos> i bless the spot , and hour , and circumstance <eos> that wed desire to a thing so high <eos> and say , glad soul , rejoice , for thou and i <eos> of bliss unpaired are made participants <eos> hence have come ardent thoughts and waking dreams <eos> that , feeding fancy from so sweet a cup <eos> leave it no lust for gross imaginings <eos> through her the woman 's perfect beauty gleams <eos> that while it gazes lifts the spirit up <eos> to that high source from which all beauty springs <eos>
i think that look of christ might seem to say <eos> “ thou , peter ! art thou then a common stone <eos> which i at last must break my heart upon <eos> for all god 's charge to his high angels may <eos> guard my foot better ? did i yesterday <eos> wash thy feet , my beloved , that they should run <eos> quick to deny me , ‘ neath the morning sun <eos> and do thy kisses , like the rest , betray <eos> the cock crows coldly . go and manifest <eos> a late contrition , but no bootless fear <eos> for when thy deadly need is bitterest <eos> thou shall not be denied as i am here <eos> my voice , to god and angels , shall attest <eos> because i knew this man let him be clear <eos>
my love is as a fever longing still <eos> for that which longer nurseth the disease <eos> feeding on that which doth preserve the ill <eos> th ’ uncertain sickly appetite to please <eos> my reason the physician to my love <eos> angry that his prescriptions are not kept <eos> hath left me , and i desperate now approve <eos> desire is death , which physic did except <eos> past cure i am , now reason is past care <eos> and frantic mad with evermore unrest <eos> my thoughts and my discourse as mad men 's are <eos> at random from the truth vainly expressed <eos> for i have sworn thee fair , and thought thee bright <eos> who art as black as hell , as dark as night <eos>
nay , in the first tumultuous days of youth <eos> with all its joys , desires , and sufferings <eos> i often called on death , and long would sit <eos> by yonder fountain , longing , in its waves <eos> to put an end alike to hope and grief <eos> and afterwards , by lingering sickness brought <eos> unto the borders of the grave , i wept <eos> o'er my lost youth , the flower of my days <eos> so prematurely fading ; often , too <eos> at late hours sitting on my conscious bed <eos> composing , by the dim light of the lamp <eos> i with the silence and the night would moan <eos> o'er my departing soul , and to myself <eos> in languid tones would sing my funeral song <eos>
these words were utter 'd in a pensive mood <eos> even while mine eyes were on that solemn sight <eos> a contrast and reproach to gross delight <eos> and life 's unspiritual pleasures daily woo 'd <eos> but now upon this thought i cannot brood <eos> it is unstable , and deserts me quite <eos> nor will i praise a cloud , however bright <eos> disparaging man 's gifts , and proper food <eos> the grove , the sky built temple , and the dome <eos> though clad in colours beautiful and pure <eos> find in the heart of man no natural home <eos> the immortal mind craves objects that endure <eos> these cleave to it ; from these it cannot roam <eos> nor they from it : their fellowship is secure <eos>
thou whose spell can raise the dead <eos> bid the prophet 's form appear <eos> “ samuel , raise thy buried head <eos> king , behold the phantom seer <eos> earth yawned ; he stood the centre of a cloud <eos> light changed its hue , retiring from his shroud . [ lm <eos> death stood all glassy in his fix é d eye <eos> his hand was withered , and his veins were dry <eos> his foot , in bony whiteness , glittered there <eos> shrunken and sinewless , and ghastly bare <eos> from lips that moved not and unbreathing frame <eos> like caverned winds , the hollow accents came <eos> saul saw , and fell to earth , as falls the oak <eos> at once , and blasted by the thunder stroke .

since brass , nor stone , nor earth , nor boundless sea <eos> but sad mortality o'ersways their power <eos> how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea <eos> whose action is no stronger than a flower <eos> o how shall summer 's honey breath hold out <eos> against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days <eos> when rocks impregnable are not so stout <eos> nor gates of steel so strong but time decays <eos> o fearful meditation , where alack <eos> shall time 's best jewel from time 's chest lie hid <eos> or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back <eos> or who his spoil of beauty can forbid <eos> o none , unless this miracle have might <eos> that in black ink my love may still shine bright <eos>

we talk of taxes , and i call you friend <eos> well , such you are ,— but well enough we know <eos> how thick about us root , how rankly grow <eos> those subtle weeds no man has need to tend <eos> that flourish through neglect , and soon must send <eos> perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow <eos> our steady senses ; how such matters go <eos> we are aware , and how such matters end <eos> yet shall be told no meagre passion here <eos> with lovers such as we forevermore <eos> isolde drinks the draught , and guinevere <eos> receives the table 's ruin through her door <eos> francesca , with the loud surf at her ear <eos> lets fall the colored book upon the floor <eos>
five hundred danish youths this post maintain 'd <eos> to fight alike , and hardy ravage train 'd <eos> prepared the fiercest mountain host to dare <eos> and dash from many a battlement the war <eos> prepared to hurl the whizzing lance , to pour <eos> the missive flame , or dart the arrowy shower <eos> young eric the selected squadron led <eos> count bernheim 's son , in camps and contests bred <eos> a fiery spirit , never at a stay <eos> with martial projects teeming night and day <eos> alike by terror , pity , and remorse <eos> untouch 'd , he held , thro ’ crimes , his fearless course <eos> proud , like his king , to conquer and oppress <eos> in action rash , and haughty with success <eos>
unlike are we , unlike , o princely heart <eos> unlike our uses and our destinies <eos> our ministering two angels look surprise <eos> on one another , as they strike athwart <eos> their wings in passing . thou , bethink thee , art <eos> a guest for queens to social pageantries <eos> with gages from a hundred brighter eyes <eos> than tears even can make mine , to play thy part <eos> of chief musician . what hast thou to do <eos> with looking from the lattice lights at me <eos> a poor , tired , wandering singer , singing through <eos> the dark , and leaning up a cypress tree <eos> the chrism is on thine head ,— on mine , the dew <eos> and death must dig the level where these agree <eos>
above the ruin of god 's holy place <eos> where man forsaken lay the bleeding rood <eos> whose hands , when men had craved substantial food <eos> gave not , nor folded when they cried , embrace <eos> i saw exalted in the latter days <eos> her whom west winds with natal foam bedewed <eos> wafted toward cyprus , lily breasted , nude <eos> standing with arms out stretched and flower like face <eos> and , sick with all those centuries of tears <eos> shed in the penance for factitious woe <eos> once more i saw the nations at her feet <eos> for love shone in their eyes , and in their ears <eos> come unto me , love beckoned them , for lo <eos> the breast your lips abjured is still as sweet <eos>
one judges as the weather dictates ; right <eos> the poem is at noon , and wrong at night <eos> another judges by a surer gage <eos> an author 's principles , or parentage <eos> since his great ancestors in flanders fell <eos> the poem doubtless must be written well <eos> another judges by the writer 's look <eos> another judges , for he bought the book <eos> some judge , their knack of judging wrong to keep <eos> some judge , because it is too soon to sleep <eos> thus all will judge , and with one single aim <eos> to gain themselves , not give the writer , fame <eos> the very best ambitiously advise <eos> half to serve you , and half to pass for wise <eos>
a few spare guineas may the conquest make <eos> i love the treachery for treachery 's sake <eos> and when her wounded honour jealous grows <eos> i 'll cut away ten thousand oaths and vows <eos> and tell my comrades , with a manly stride <eos> how i , a girl out witten and out lied <eos> such was not herbert — he had never known <eos> love 's genuine smiles , nor suffer 'd from his frown <eos> and as to that most honourable part <eos> of planting daggers in a parent 's heart <eos> a novice quite :— he past his hours away <eos> free as a bird and buxom as the day <eos> yet , should a lovely girl by chance arise <eos> think not that herbert brooks would shut his eyes <eos>
dear chorister , who from those shadows sends <eos> ere that the blushing morn dare show her light <eos> such sad lamenting strains , that night attends <eos> become all ear , stars stay to hear thy plight <eos> if one whose grief even reach of thought transcends <eos> who ne'er , not in a dream , did taste delight <eos> may thee importune who like care pretends <eos> and seems to joy in woe , in woe 's despite <eos> tell me ( so may thou fortune milder try <eos> and long , long sing ) for what thou thus complains <eos> since , winter gone , the sun in dappled sky <eos> now smiles on meadows , mountains , woods , and plains <eos> the bird , as if my questions did her move <eos> with trembling wings sobbed forth , i love ! i love <eos>
i could not think of thee as piec è d rot <eos> yet such thou wert , for thou hadst been long dead <eos> yet thou liv ’ dst entire in my seeing thought <eos> and what thou wert in me had never fled <eos> nay , i had fixed the moments of thy beauty <eos> thy ebbing smile , thy kiss ’ s readiness <eos> and memory had taught my heart the duty <eos> to know thee ever at that deathlessness <eos> but when i came where thou wert laid , and saw <eos> the natural flowers ignoring thee sans blame <eos> and the encroaching grass , with casual flaw <eos> framing the stone to age where was thy name <eos> i knew not how to feel , nor what to be <eos> towards thy fate ’ s material secrecy <eos>
wonder it is and pity is't that she <eos> in whom all beauty 's treasure we may find <eos> that may unrich the body and the mind <eos> towards the poor should use no charity <eos> my love has gone a begging unto thee <eos> and if that beauty had not been more kind <eos> that pity , long ere this he had been pined <eos> but beauty is content his food to be <eos> o pity have when such poor orphans beg <eos> love , naked boy , hath nothing on his back <eos> and though he wanteth neither arm nor leg <eos> yet maimed he is sith he his sight doth lack <eos> and yet though blind he beauty can behold <eos> and yet though naked he feels more heat than cold <eos>
all are but parts of one stupendous whole <eos> whose body nature is , and god the soul <eos> that , changed through all , and yet in all the same <eos> great in the earth , as in th ’ ethereal frame <eos> warms in the sun , refreshes in the breeze <eos> glows in the stars , and blossoms in the trees <eos> lives through all life , extends through all extent <eos> spreads undivided , operates unspent <eos> breathes in our soul , informs our mortal part <eos> as full , as perfect , in a hair as heart <eos> as full , as perfect , in vile man that mourns <eos> as the rapt seraph that adores and burns <eos> to him no high , no low , no great , no small <eos> he fills , he bounds , connects , and equals all <eos>
“ ‘ i died for thee ; for thee i am alive <eos> and my humanity doth mourn for thee <eos> for thou art mine ; and all thy little ones <eos> they , too , are mine , are mine . behold , the house <eos> is dark , but there is brightness where the sons <eos> of god are singing , and , behold , the heart <eos> is troubled : yet the nations walk in white <eos> they have forgotten how to weep ; and thou <eos> shalt also come , and i will foster thee <eos> and satisfy thy soul ; and thou shall warm <eos> thy trembling life beneath the smile of god <eos> a little while — it is a little while <eos> a little while , and i will comfort thee <eos> i go away , but i will come again <eos>
what it is to breathe and live without life <eos> how to be pale with anguish , red with fear <eos> t'have peace abroad , and nought within but strife <eos> wish to be present , and yet shun t'appear <eos> how to be bold far off , and bashful near <eos> how to think much , and have no words to speak <eos> to crave redress , yet hold affliction dear <eos> to have affection strong , a body weak <eos> never to find , yet evermore to seek <eos> and seek that which i dare not hope to find <eos> t'affect this life and yet this life disleek <eos> grateful t'another , to myself unkind <eos> this cruel knowledge of these contraries <eos> delia , my heart hath learned out of those eyes <eos>
o nightingale that on yon bloomy spray <eos> warblest at eve , when all the woods are still <eos> thou with fresh hope the lover 's heart dost fill <eos> while the jolly hours lead on propitious may <eos> thy liquid notes that close the eye of day <eos> first heard before the shallow cuckoo 's bill <eos> portend success in love . o , if jove 's will <eos> have linked that amorous power to thy soft lay <eos> now timely sing , ere the rude bird of hate <eos> foretell my hopeless doom , in some grove nigh <eos> as thou from year to year hast sung too late <eos> for my relief , yet hadst no reason why <eos> whether the muse or love call thee his mate <eos> both them i serve , and of their train am i <eos>
weary with toil , i haste me to my bed <eos> the dear respose for limbs with travel tired <eos> but then begins a journey in my head <eos> to work my mind , when body 's work 's expired <eos> for then my thoughts ( from far where i abide <eos> intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee <eos> and keep my drooping eyelids open wide <eos> looking on darkness which the blind do see <eos> save that my soul 's imaginary sight <eos> presents thy shadow to my sightless view <eos> which like a jewel ( hung in ghastly night <eos> makes black night beauteous , and her old face new <eos> lo thus by day my limbs , by night my mind <eos> for thee , and for my self , no quiet find <eos>
for if alone thou think to waft my love <eos> her cold is such as can the sea command <eos> and frozen ice shall let thy boat to move <eos> nor can thy forces row it from the land <eos> but if thou friendly both at once shalt take <eos> thyself mayst rest . for why ? my sighs will blow <eos> our cold and heat so sweet a thaw shall make <eos> as that thy boat without thy help shall row <eos> then will i sit and glut me on those eyes <eos> wherewith my life my eyes could never fill <eos> thus from my boat that comfort shall arise <eos> the want whereof my life and hope did kill <eos> together placed so thou her scorn shalt cross <eos> where if we part thy boat must suffer loss <eos>
thus , thus , o soul ! in that more awful hour <eos> when the last judgment 's darker shadows lower <eos> and , swift and stern , god 's messengers go forth <eos> to reap the harvest of this fated earth <eos> if then , on thee is found no crimson stain <eos> of god 's own lamb on bloody calvary slain <eos> if thou art resting not beneath the blood <eos> of that one sacrifice ordained of god <eos> where wilt thou fly ?— where hide thyself away <eos> from the dread reck'ning of the judgment day <eos> if resting ‘ neath the blood for sinners spilt <eos> look up !— the judge himself has borne thy guilt <eos> justice and judgement claim thy life in vain <eos> since christ , thy passover , himself is slain <eos>
many in aftertimes will say of you <eos> “ he loved her ” — while of me what will they say <eos> not that i loved you more than just in play <eos> for fashion 's sake as idle women do <eos> even let them prate ; who know not what we knew <eos> of love and parting in exceeding pain <eos> of parting hopeless here to meet again <eos> hopeless on earth , and heaven is out of view <eos> but by my heart of love laid bare to you <eos> my love that you can make not void nor vain <eos> love that foregoes you but to claim anew <eos> beyond this passage of the gate of death <eos> i charge you at the judgment make it plain <eos> my love of you was life and not a breath <eos>
long time a child , and still a child , when years <eos> had painted manhood on my check , was i <eos> for yet i lived like one not born to die <eos> a thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears <eos> no hope i needed , and i knew no fears <eos> but sleep , though sweet , is only sleep ; and waking <eos> i waked to sleep no more ; at once o'ertaking <eos> the vanguard of my age , with all arrears <eos> of duty on my back . nor child , nor man <eos> nor youth , nor sage , i find my head is gray <eos> for i have lost the race i never ran <eos> a rathe december blights my lagging may <eos> and still i am a child , though i be old <eos> time is my debtor for my years untold <eos>

was this his coming ! i had hoped to see <eos> a scene of wondrous glory , as was told <eos> of some great god who in a rain of gold <eos> broke open bars and fell on danae <eos> or a dread vision as when semele <eos> sickening for love and unappeased desire <eos> prayed to see god 's clear body , and the fire <eos> caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly <eos> with such glad dreams i sought this holy place <eos> and now with wondering eyes and heart i stand <eos> before this supreme mystery of love <eos> some kneeling girl with passionless pale face <eos> an angel with a lily in his hand <eos> and over both the white wings of a dove <eos>
why are we by all creatures waited on <eos> why do the prodigal elements supply <eos> life and food to me , being more pure than i <eos> simpler , and further from corruption <eos> why brook'st thou , ignorant horse , subjection <eos> why do you , bull and boar , so sillily <eos> dissemble weakness , and by one man 's stroke die <eos> whose whole kind you might swallow and feed upon <eos> weaker i am , woe 's me ! and worse than you <eos> you have not sinned , nor need be timorous <eos> but wonder at a greater , for to us <eos> created nature doth these things subdue <eos> but their creator , whom sin nor nature tied <eos> for us , his creatures and his foes , hath died <eos>
the bubbling brook doth leap when i come by <eos> because my feet find measure with its call <eos> the birds know when the friend they love is nigh <eos> for i am known to them , both great and small <eos> the flower that on the lonely hillside grows <eos> expects me there when spring its bloom has given <eos> and many a tree and bush my wanderings knows <eos> and e'en the clouds and silent stars of heaven <eos> for he who with his maker walks aright <eos> shall be their lord as adam was before <eos> his ear shall catch each sound with new delight <eos> each object wear the dress that then it wore <eos> and he , as when erect in soul he stood <eos> hear from his father 's lips that all is good <eos>
it is not death which wretched men call dying <eos> but that is very death which i endure <eos> when my coy looking nymph , her grace envying <eos> by fatal frowns my domage doth procure <eos> it is not life which we for life approve <eos> but that is life when on her wool soft paps <eos> i seal sweet kisses which do batten love <eos> and doubling them do treble my good haps <eos> ‘ tis neither love the son , nor love the mother <eos> which lovers praise and pray to ; but that love is <eos> which she in eye and i in heart do smother <eos> then muse not though i glory in my miss <eos> since she who holds my heart and me in durance <eos> hath life , death , love and all in her procurance <eos>
venemous tongue , tipt with vile adders sting <eos> of that self kynd with which the furies fell <eos> their snaky heads doe combe , from which a spring <eos> of poysoned words and spightfull speeches well <eos> let all the plagues and horrid paines of hell <eos> upon thee fall for thine accursed hyre <eos> that with false forged lyes , which thou didst tell <eos> in my true love did stirre up coles of yre <eos> the sparkes whereof let kindle thine own fyre <eos> and , catching hold on thine own wicked bed <eos> consume thee quite , that didst with guile conspire <eos> in my sweet peace such breaches to have bred <eos> shame be thy meed , and mischiefe thy reward <eos> due to thy selfe , that it for me prepard <eos>
his fellow chiefs inhale the hero 's flame <eos> nerves of his arm and partners in his fame <eos> phillips , with treasured thunders poised and wheel 'd <eos> in brazen tubes , prepares to rake the field <eos> the trench tops darken with the sable rows <eos> and , tipt with fire , the waving match rope glows <eos> there gallant reidesel in german guise <eos> and specht and breyman , prompt for action , rise <eos> his savage hordes the murderous johnson leads <eos> files thro the woods and treads the tangled weeds <eos> shuns open combat , teaches where to run <eos> skulk , couch the ambush , aim the hunter 's gun <eos> whirl the sly tomahawk , the war whoop sing <eos> divide the spoils and pack the scalps they bring <eos>
but ida stood nor spoke , drained of her force <eos> by many a varying influence and so long <eos> down through her limbs a drooping languor wept <eos> her head a little bent ; and on her mouth <eos> a doubtful smile dwelt like a clouded moon <eos> in a still water : then brake out my sire <eos> lifted his grim head from my wounds . ‘ o you <eos> woman , whom we thought woman even now <eos> and were half fooled to let you tend our son <eos> because he might have wished it — but we see <eos> the accomplice of your madness unforgiven <eos> and think that you might mix his draught with death <eos> when your skies change again : the rougher hand <eos> is safer : on to the tents : take up the prince <eos>

“ o mother ida , harken ere i die <eos> still she spake on and still she spake of power <eos> ‘ which in all action is the end of all <eos> power fitted to the season ; wisdom bred <eos> and throned of wisdom — from all neighbour crowns <eos> alliance and allegiance , till thy hand <eos> fail from the sceptre staff . such boon from me <eos> from me , heaven 's queen , paris to thee king born <eos> a shepherd all thy life but yet king born <eos> should come most welcome , seeing men , in power <eos> only , are likest gods , who have attain 'd <eos> rest in a happy place and quiet seats <eos> above the thunder , with undying bliss <eos> in knowledge of their own supremacy <eos>
lo ! in the west , fast fades the lingering light <eos> and day 's last vestige takes its silent flight <eos> no more is heard the woodman 's measured stroke <eos> which with the dawn from yonder dingle broke <eos> no more , hoarse clamouring o'er the uplifted head <eos> the crows assembling seek their wind rock 'd bed <eos> still 'd is the village hum — the woodland sounds <eos> have ceased to echo o'er the dewy grounds <eos> and general silence reigns , save when below <eos> the murmuring trent is scarcely heard to flow <eos> and save when , swung by ‘ nighted rustic late <eos> oft , on its hinge , rebounds the jarring gate <eos> or when the sheep bell , in the distant vale <eos> breathes its wild music on the downy gale <eos>
dream footsteps wandering past us in our sleep <eos> a restless presence stirring with the light <eos> the cry of waters where the snow was white <eos> a violet 's whisper where dead leaves lay deep <eos> the dim wood 's music makes a sudden leap <eos> broken notes , blending in a wild delight <eos> and lo ! the whole world changes in our sight <eos> promise is ended — we must turn and reap <eos> fulfilment , for the spring with all her wealth <eos> is with us , and compels us to her will <eos> yet if the sun dawn we should shun by stealth <eos> yearning for shadows and the darkened hours <eos> sweet lord , be pitiful , remembering still <eos> one lieth low beneath the budding flowers <eos>
if the dull substance of my flesh were thought <eos> injurious distance should not stop my way <eos> for then despite of space i would be brought <eos> from limits far remote , where thou dost stay <eos> no matter then although my foot did stand <eos> upon the farthest earth removed from thee <eos> for nimble thought can jump both sea and land <eos> as soon as think the place where he would be <eos> but ah , thought kills me that i am not thought <eos> to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone <eos> but that so much of earth and water wrought <eos> i must attend , time 's leisure with my moan <eos> receiving nought by elements so slow <eos> but heavy tears , badges of either 's woe <eos>
oh , my beloved , have you thought of this <eos> how in the years to come unscrupulous time <eos> more cruel than death , will tear you from my kiss <eos> and make you old , and leave me in my prime <eos> how you and i , who scale together yet <eos> a little while the sweet , immortal height <eos> no pilgrim may remember or forget <eos> as sure as the world turns , some granite night <eos> shall lie awake and know the gracious flame <eos> gone out forever on the mutual stone <eos> and call to mind that on the day you came <eos> i was a child , and you a hero grown <eos> and the night pass , and the strange morning break <eos> upon our anguish for each other 's sake <eos>

she said ; nor man nor woman then was left <eos> within the city ; o'er the minds of all <eos> grief pass 'd , resistless ; to the gates in throngs <eos> they press 'd , to crowd round him who brought the dead <eos> the first to clasp the body were his wife <eos> and honour 'd mother ; eagerly they sprang <eos> on the smooth rolling wain , to touch the head <eos> of hector ; round them , weeping , stood the crowd <eos> weeping , till sunset , all the live long day <eos> had they before the gates for hector mourn 'd <eos> had not old priam from the car address 'd <eos> the crowd : “ make way , that so the mules may pass <eos> when to my house i shall have brought my dead <eos> ye there may vent your sorrow as ye will <eos>
but first the monarch , so polite <eos> asked mr. whitbread if he 'd be a knight <eos> unwilling in the list to be enrolled <eos> whitbread contemplated the knights of peg <eos> then to his generous sovereign made a leg <eos> and said , “ he was afraid he was too old <eos> he thanked however his most gracious king <eos> for offering to make him such a thing <eos> but , ah ! a different reason ‘ twas i fear <eos> it was not age that bade the man of beer <eos> the proffered honor of the monarch shun <eos> the tale of margaret 's knife , and royal fright <eos> had almost made him damn the name of knight <eos> a tale that farrowed such a world of fun <eos>
on ! leave the past to bury its own dead <eos> the past is naught to us , the present all <eos> what need of last year 's leaves to strew love 's bed <eos> what need of ghosts to grace a festival <eos> i would not , if i could , those days recall <eos> those days not ours . for us the feast is spread <eos> the lamps are lit , and music plays withal <eos> then let us love and leave the rest unsaid <eos> this island is our home . around it roar <eos> great gulfs and oceans , channels , straits and seas <eos> what matter in what wreck we reached the shore <eos> so we both reached it ? we can mock at these <eos> oh leave the past , if past indeed there be <eos> i would not know it ; i would know but thee <eos>
thou , from the first , unborn , undying love <eos> albeit we gaze not on thy glories near <eos> before the face of god didst breath and move <eos> though night and pain and ruin and death reign here <eos> thou foldest , like a golden atmosphere <eos> the very throne of the eternal god <eos> passing through thee the edicts of his fear <eos> are mellowed into music , borne abroad <eos> by the loud winds , though they uprend the sea <eos> even from his central deeps : thine empery <eos> is over all : thou wilt not brook eclipse <eos> thou goest and returnest to his lips <eos> like lightning : thou dost ever brood above <eos> the silence of all hearts , unutterable love <eos>
fools be they that inveigh ‘ gainst mahomet <eos> who 's but a moral of love 's monarchy <eos> but a dull adamant , as straw by jet <eos> he in an iron chest was drawn on high <eos> in midst of mecca 's temple roof , some say <eos> he now hangs without touch or stay at all <eos> that mahomet is she to whom i pray <eos> may ne'er man pray so ineffectual <eos> mine eyes , love 's strange exhaling adamants <eos> un'wares , to my heart 's temple 's height have wrought <eos> the iron idol that compassion wants <eos> who my oft tears and travails sets at nought <eos> iron hath been transformed to gold by art <eos> her face , limbs , flesh and all , gold ; save her heart <eos>
to this harangue the wary youth replied <eos> in truth , fair lady , i could ne'er decide <eos> to criticise what others round may do <eos> ‘ tis not the line i 'd willingly pursue <eos> and i will freely say , that your discourse <eos> has much surprised me , though ‘ tis void of force <eos> to you it surely never can belong <eos> to say variety in love is wrong <eos> besides , your sex , and decency , ‘ tis clear <eos> to ev'ry disadvantage you appear <eos> what use this eloquence , and what your aim <eos> such charms alone as your 's could me inflame <eos> their pow'r is great , but fully i declare <eos> i do not like advances from the fair <eos>
the first time that the sun rose on thine oath <eos> to love me , i looked forward to the moon <eos> to slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon <eos> and quickly tied to make a lasting troth <eos> quick loving hearts , i thought , may quickly loathe <eos> and , looking on myself , i seemed not one <eos> for such man 's love !— more like an out of tune <eos> worn viol , a good singer would be wroth <eos> to spoil his song with , and which , snatched in haste <eos> is laid down at the first ill sounding note <eos> i did not wrong myself so , but i placed <eos> a wrong on thee . for perfect strains may float <eos> ‘ neath master hands , from instruments defaced <eos> and great souls , at one stroke , may do and doat <eos>
but when that goodly frame by ravening fire <eos> was all consumed , they quenched the pyre with wine <eos> they gathered up the bones , and reverently <eos> laid in a golden casket . hard beside <eos> rhoeteium 's headland heaped they up a mound <eos> measureless high . then scattered they amidst <eos> the long ships , heavy hearted for the man <eos> whom they had honoured even as achilles <eos> then black night , bearing unto all men sleep <eos> upfloated : so they brake bread , and lay down <eos> waiting the child of the mist . short was sleep <eos> broken by fitful staring through the dark <eos> haunted by dread lest in the night the foe <eos> should fall on them , now telamon 's son was dead <eos>
swift , at the word , the herald speeds along <eos> the lofty ramparts , through the martial throng <eos> and finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore <eos> opposed in combat on the dusty shore <eos> “ ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands <eos> your aid ( said thoos ) peteus ’ son demands <eos> your strength , united , best may help to bear <eos> the bloody labours of the doubtful war <eos> thither the lycian princes bend their course <eos> the best and bravest of the hostile force <eos> but if too fiercely , here , the foes contend <eos> at least , let telamon those towers defend <eos> and teucer haste with his unerring bow <eos> to share the danger , and repel the foe <eos>
victorious through failure ! faithful lord <eos> who for twelve angel legions wouldst not pray <eos> from thine own country of eternal day <eos> to shield thee from the lanterned traitor horde <eos> making thy one rash servant sheathe his sword <eos> our long retarded legions , on their way <eos> toiling through sands , and shouldering nile 's down sway <eos> to reach thy soldier , keeping at thy word <eos> thou sawest foiled — but glorifiedst him <eos> over ten cities giving him thy rule <eos> we will not mourn a star that grew not dim <eos> a soldier child of god gone home from school <eos> a dregless cup , with life brimmed , he did quaff <eos> and quaffs it now with christ 's imperial staff <eos>
give me a golden pen , and let me lean <eos> on heap 'd up flowers , in regions clear , and far <eos> bring me a tablet whiter than a star <eos> or hand of hymning angel , when ‘ tis seen <eos> the silver strings of heavenly harp atween <eos> and let there glide by many a pearly car <eos> pink robes , and wavy hair , and diamond jar <eos> and half discovered wings , and glances keen <eos> the while let music wander round my ears <eos> and as it reaches each delicious ending <eos> let me write down a line of glorious tone <eos> and full of many wonders of the spheres <eos> for what a height my spirit is contending <eos> ‘ tis not content so soon to be alone <eos>
the spirit of enjoyment and desire <eos> and hopes and wishes , from all living things <eos> went circling , like a multitude of sounds <eos> the budding groves appear 'd as if in haste <eos> to spur the steps of june ; as if their shades <eos> of various green were hindrances that stood <eos> between them and their object : yet , meanwhile <eos> there was such deep contentment in the air <eos> that every naked ash , and tardy tree <eos> yet leafless , seem 'd as though the countenance <eos> with which it look 'd on this delightful day <eos> were native to the summer .— up the brook <eos> i roam 'd in the confusion of my heart <eos> alive to all things and forgetting all <eos>
music to hear , why hear'st thou music sadly <eos> sweets with sweets war not , joy delights in joy <eos> why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly <eos> or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy <eos> if the true concord of well tuned sounds <eos> by unions married do offend thine ear <eos> they do but sweetly chide thee , who confounds <eos> in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear <eos> mark how one string sweet husband to another <eos> strikes each in each by mutual ordering <eos> resembling sire , and child , and happy mother <eos> who all in one , one pleasing note do sing <eos> whose speechless song being many , seeming one <eos> sings this to thee , ‘ thou single wilt prove none <eos>
what bashful wildness in those crystal eyes <eos> fair zillia !— ah ! more dear to love the gaze <eos> that dwells upon its object , than the rays <eos> of that vague glance , quick , as in summer skies <eos> the lightning 's lambent flash , when neither rise <eos> thunder , nor storm .— i mark , while transport plays <eos> warm in thy lover 's eye , what dread betrays <eos> thy throbbing heart :— yet why from his soft sighs <eos> fleet'st thou so swift away ?— like the young hind <eos> that bending stands the fountain 's brim beside <eos> when , with a sudden gust , the western wind <eos> rustles among the boughs that shade the tide <eos> see , from the stream , innoxious and benign <eos> starting she bounds , with terror vain as thine <eos>
in those good days when we were young and wise <eos> you spake to music , you with the thoughtful eyes <eos> and god looked down from heaven , pleased to hear <eos> a young man 's song arise so firm and clear <eos> has fancy died ? the morning star gone cold <eos> why are you silent ? have we grown so old <eos> must i alone keep playing ? will not you <eos> lord of the measures , string your lyre anew <eos> lover of greece , is this the richest store <eos> you bring us ,— withered leaves and dusty lore <eos> and broken vases widowed of their wine <eos> to brand you pedant while you stand divine <eos> decorous words beseem the learned lip <eos> but poets have the nicer scholarship <eos>
when poets would be lofty , they commence <eos> with some gay patch of cheap magnificence <eos> of dian 's altar and her grove we read <eos> or rapid streams meandering through the mead <eos> or grand descriptions of the river rhine <eos> or watery bow , will take up many a line <eos> all in their way good things , but not just now <eos> you 're happy at a cypress , we 'll allow <eos> but what of that ? you 're painting by command <eos> a shipwrecked sailor , striking out for land <eos> that crockery was a jar when you began <eos> it ends a pitcher : you an artist , man <eos> make what you will , in short , so , when ‘ tis done <eos> ‘ tis but consistent , homogeneous , one <eos>
upon the steps a woman stands — alone <eos> her lovely face , a trifle paler grown <eos> since last we looked upon its haunting grace <eos> yet still the same child mouth , the radiant eyes <eos> the dauntless pride , that time cannot efface <eos> before her gazes the earth in beauty lies <eos> awhile she stands and gaze on the scene <eos> with dreamy , far off looks and thoughtful mien <eos> then wends her way to where the flowers lie <eos> she lingers here , she cannot pass them by <eos> and as she bends to touch each smiling flower <eos> her hands seem gifted with a magic power <eos> that draws unto herself their clinging love <eos> as human tendrils drawn to god above <eos>
but do thy worst to steal thy self away <eos> for term of life thou art assured mine <eos> and life no longer than thy love will stay <eos> for it depends upon that love of thine <eos> then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs <eos> when in the least of them my life hath end <eos> i see , a better state to me belongs <eos> than that , which on thy humour doth depend <eos> thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind <eos> since that my life on thy revolt doth lie <eos> o what a happy title do i find <eos> happy to have thy love , happy to die <eos> but what 's so blessed fair that fears no blot <eos> thou mayst be false , and yet i know it not <eos>
unhappy wit , like most mistaken things <eos> atones not for that envy which it brings <eos> in youth alone its empty praise we boast <eos> but soon the short lived vanity is lost <eos> like some fair flower the early spring supplies <eos> that gayly blooms but even in blooming dies <eos> what is this wit , which must our cares employ <eos> the owner 's wife that other men enjoy <eos> then most our trouble still when most admired <eos> and still the more we give the more required <eos> whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease <eos> sure some to vex , but never all to please <eos> ‘ tis what the vicious fear , the virtuous shun <eos> by fools ‘ tis hated , and by knaves undone <eos>
“ andromach è! my soul 's far better part <eos> why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart <eos> no hostile hand can antedate my doom <eos> till fate condemns me to the silent tomb <eos> fixed is the term to all the race of earth <eos> and such the hard condition of our birth <eos> no force can then resist , no flight can save <eos> all sink alike , the fearful and the brave <eos> no more — but hasten to thy tasks at home <eos> there guide the spindle , and direct the loom <eos> me glory summons to the martial scene <eos> the field of combat is the sphere for men <eos> where heroes war , the foremost place i claim <eos> the first in danger as the first in fame <eos>
wiglaf discoursed then , wihstan his son <eos> 20 “ oft many an earlman on one man 's account must <eos> sorrow endure , as to us it hath happened <eos> the liegelord belov è d we could little prevail on <eos> kingdom 's keeper , counsel to follow <eos> not to go to the guardian of the gold hoard , but let him <eos> 25 lie where he long was , live in his dwelling <eos> till the end of the world . met we a destiny <eos> hard to endure : the hoard has been looked at <eos> been gained very grimly ; too grievous the fate that <eos> the prince of the people pricked to come thither <eos> 30 i was therein and all of it looked at <eos> the building 's equipments , since access was given me <eos> not kindly at all entrance permitted <eos>
at ephesus , in former times , once shone <eos> a fair , whose charms would dignify a throne <eos> and , if to publick rumour credit ‘ s due <eos> celestial bliss her husband with her knew <eos> naught else was talked of but her beauteous face <eos> and chastity that adds the highest grace <eos> from ev'ry quarter numbers flocked to see <eos> this belle , regarded as from errors free <eos> the honour of her sex , and country too <eos> as such , old mothers held her up to view <eos> and wished their offspring 's wives like her to act <eos> the sons desired the very same in fact <eos> from her , beyond a doubt , our prudes descend <eos> an ancient , celebrated house , depend <eos>
“ thou too , ernestus ! what protecting doom <eos> has guided thee thro ’ fate 's tremendous gloom <eos> unhappy relic of a patriot line <eos> dost thou with all their ancient glory shine <eos> and , unappall 'd by labour or by fear <eos> lift for thy country the protecting spear <eos> or , wrapt in fetters , and in darkness lost <eos> say , dost thou languish for thy native coast <eos> perhaps , unnoted , by the tyrant 's eyes <eos> in unknown solitude secure he lies <eos> whate'er his fate , nor terror 's base control <eos> nor hostile bribes , can e'er have moved his soul <eos> no ! taught by me , ernestus nobly spurns <eos> each vulgar aim , and for his country burns <eos>
then down her bow the winged iris drives <eos> and swift at priam ’ s mournful court arrives <eos> where the sad sons beside their father ’ s throne <eos> sat bathed in tears , and answer ’ d groan with groan <eos> and all amidst them lay the hoary sire <eos> ( sad scene of woe !) his face his wrapp ’ d attire <eos> conceal ’ d from sight ; with frantic hands he spread <eos> a shower of ashes o ’ er his neck and head <eos> from room to room his pensive daughters roam <eos> whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome <eos> mindful of those , who late their pride and joy <eos> lie pale and breathless round the fields of troy <eos> before the king jove ’ s messenger appears <eos> and thus in whispers greets his trembling ears <eos>
it is not then enough that men who give <eos> the best gifts given of man to man should feel <eos> alive , a snake 's head ever at their heel <eos> small hurt the worms may do them while they live <eos> such hurt as scorn for scorn 's sake may forgive <eos> but now , when death and fame have set one seal <eos> on tombs whereat love , grief , and glory kneel <eos> men sift all secrets , in their critic sieve <eos> of graves wherein the dust of death might shrink <eos> to know what tongues defile the dead man 's name <eos> with loathsome love , and praise that stings like shame <eos> rest once was theirs , who had crossed the mortal brink <eos> no rest , no reverence now : dull fools undress <eos> death 's holiest shrine , life 's veriest nakedness <eos>
how beautiful !— was this not one of eld <eos> that chaos on his boundless bosom held <eos> till earth came forward in a rush of storm <eos> closing his ribs upon her wingless form <eos> how beautiful !— the very lips do speak <eos> of love , and bid us worship : the pale cheek <eos> seems blushing through the marble — through the snow <eos> and the undrap'ried bosom feels a flow <eos> of fever on its brightness ; every vein <eos> at the blue pulse swells softly , like a chain <eos> of gentle hills . i would not fling a wreath <eos> of jewels on that brow , to flash beneath <eos> those queenly tresses ; for itself is more <eos> than sea born pearl of some elysian shore <eos>
those hours that with gentle work did frame <eos> the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell <eos> will play the tyrants to the very same <eos> and that unfair which fairly doth excel <eos> for never resting time leads summer on <eos> to hideous winter and confounds him there <eos> sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone <eos> beauty o'erhyppphensnowed and bareness every where <eos> then were not summer 's distillation left <eos> a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass <eos> beauty 's effect with beauty were bereft <eos> nor it nor no remembrance what it was <eos> but flowers distilled though they with winter meet <eos> leese but their show , their substance still lives sweet <eos>
away they went , and gyges much admired <eos> still more than that : in truth his breast was fired <eos> for when she moved astonishment was great <eos> and ev'ry grace upon her seemed to wait <eos> emotion to suppress howe'er he tried <eos> since he had promised what he felt to hide <eos> to hold his tongue he wished , but that might raise <eos> suspicions of designs and mystick ways <eos> exaggeration was the better part <eos> and from the subject he would never start <eos> but fully praised each beauty in detail <eos> without appearing any thing to veil <eos> gods ! gyges cried , how truly , king , you 're blessed <eos> the skin how fair — how charming all the rest <eos>
then spake king arthur to sir bedivere <eos> “ far other is this battle in the west <eos> whereto we move , than when we strove in youth <eos> and brake the petty kings , and fought with rome <eos> or thrust the heathen from the roman wall <eos> and shook him thro ’ the north . ill doom is mine <eos> to war against my people and my knights <eos> the king who fights his people fights himself <eos> and they my knights , who loved me once , the stroke <eos> that strikes them dead is as my death to me <eos> yet let us hence , and find or feel a way <eos> thro ’ this blind haze , which ever since i saw <eos> one lying in the dust at almesbury <eos> hath folded in the passes of the world <eos>
the eye was shut in men ; the hearing ear <eos> dull unto deafness ; nought but earthly things <eos> had credence ; and no highest art that flings <eos> a spirit radiance from it , like the spear <eos> of the ice pointed mountain , lifted clear <eos> in the nigh sunrise , had made skyey springs <eos> of light in the clouds of dull imaginings <eos> vain were the painter or the sculptor here <eos> give man the listening heart , the seeing eye <eos> give life ; let sea derived fountain well <eos> within his spirit , infant waves , to tell <eos> of the far ocean mysteries that lie <eos> silent upon the horizon ,— evermore <eos> falling in voices on the human shore <eos>
now gentle sleep hath clos è d up those eyes <eos> which waking kept my boldest thoughts in awe <eos> and free access unto that sweet lip lies <eos> from whence i long the rosy breath to draw <eos> methinks no wrong it were if i should steal <eos> from those two melting rubies , one poor kiss <eos> none sees the theft that would the thief reveal <eos> nor rob i her of aught which she can miss <eos> nay , should i twenty kisses take away <eos> there would be little sign i had done so <eos> why then should i this robbery delay <eos> oh , she may wake , and therewith angry grow <eos> well , if she do , i 'll back restore that one <eos> and twenty hundred thousand more for loan <eos>
we soon approach 'd it . o thou lombard spirit <eos> how didst thou stand , in high abstracted mood <eos> scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes <eos> it spoke not aught , but let us onward pass <eos> eyeing us as a lion on his watch <eos> but virgil with entreaty mild advanc 'd <eos> requesting it to show the best ascent <eos> it answer to his question none return 'd <eos> but of our country and our kind of life <eos> demanded . when my courteous guide began <eos> “ mantua , ” the solitary shadow quick <eos> rose towards us from the place in which it stood <eos> and cry 'd , “ mantuan ! i am thy countryman <eos> sordello . ” each the other then embrac 'd <eos>
a poor companion whom his friend takes down <eos> to fair surrentum or brundisium 's town <eos> if he makes much of cold , bad roads , and rain <eos> or moans o'er cashhyppphenbox forced and money ta'en <eos> reminds us of a girl , some artful thing <eos> who cries for a lost bracelet or a ring <eos> with this result , that when she comes to grieve <eos> for real misfortunes , no one will believe <eos> so , hoaxed by one impostor , in the street <eos> a man wo n't set a cripple on his feet <eos> though he invoke osiris , and appeal <eos> with streaming tears to hearts that will not feel <eos> “ lift up a poor lame man ! i tell no lie <eos> “ treat foreigners to that , ” the neighbours cry <eos>
but when the dance was o'er , and arm in arm <eos> ( the full heart beating ‘ gainst the elbow warm <eos> we pass 'd to the great refreshment hall <eos> where the heap 'd cheese cakes and the comfits small <eos> lay , like a hive of sunbeams , to burn <eos> around the margin of the negus urn <eos> when my poor quivering hand you finger 'd twice <eos> and , with inquiring accents , whisper 'd “ ice <eos> water , or cream ? ” i could no more dissemble <eos> but dropp 'd upon the couch all in a tremble <eos> a swimming faintness misted o'er my brain <eos> the corks seem 'd starting from the brisk champagne <eos> the custards fell untouch 'd upon the floor <eos> thine eyes met mine . that night we danced no more <eos>
a painter drew the image of the boy <eos> swift love , with wings all naked , and yet blind <eos> with bow and arrows , bent for to destroy <eos> i blamed his skill , and fault i thus did find <eos> “ a needless task i see thy cunning take <eos> misled by love , thy fancy thee betrayed <eos> love is no boy , nor blind , as men him make <eos> nor weapons wears , whereof to be affrayed <eos> but if thou , love , wilt paint with greatest skill <eos> a love , a maid , a goddess , and a queen <eos> wonder and view at licia 's picture still <eos> for other love the world hath never seen <eos> for she alone all hope all comfort gives <eos> men 's hearts , souls , all , led by her favour lives <eos>
after the fierce midsummer all ablaze <eos> has burned itself to ashes , and expires <eos> in the intensity of its own fires <eos> there come the mellow , mild , st. martin days <eos> crowned with the calm of peace , but sad with haze <eos> so after love has led us , till he tires <eos> of his own throes and torments and desires <eos> comes large eyed friendship : with a restful gaze <eos> he beckons us to follow , and across <eos> cool , verdant vales we wander free from care <eos> is it a touch of frost lies in the air <eos> why are we haunted with a sense of loss <eos> we do not wish the pain back , or the heat <eos> and yet , and yet , these days are incomplete <eos>
look in my griefs , and blame me not to mourn <eos> from care to care that leads a life so bad <eos> th'orphan of fortune , born to be her scorn <eos> whose clouded brow doth make my days so sad <eos> long are their nights whose cares do never sleep <eos> loathsome their days who never sun yet joyed <eos> the impression of her eyes do pierce so deep <eos> that thus i live both day and night annoyed <eos> yet since the sweetest root yields fruit so sour <eos> her praise from my complaint i may not part <eos> i love th'effect , the cause being of this power <eos> i 'll praise her face and blame her flinty heart <eos> whilst we both make the world admire at us <eos> her for disdain , and me for loving thus <eos>
despise the garish presences that flaunt <eos> the obvious possession of today <eos> to wear with me the spectacles that haunt <eos> the optic sense with wraiths of yesterday <eos> these cobbled shores through which the traffic streams <eos> have been the stage set of successive towns <eos> where coffined actors postured out their dreams <eos> and harlot folly changed her thousand gowns <eos> this corner shop was bull 's head tavern <eos> when names now dead on marble lived in clay <eos> its rooms were like a sanded cavern <eos> where candles made a sallow jest of day <eos> and drovers ’ boots came grinding like a quern <eos> while merchants drank their steaming cups of “ tay <eos>
i am in love with high far seeing places <eos> that look on plains half sunlight and half storm <eos> in love with hours when from the circling faces <eos> veils pass , and laughing fellowship glows warm <eos> you who look on me with grave eyes where rapture <eos> and april love of living burn confessed <eos> the gods are good ! the world lies free to capture <eos> life has no walls . o take me to your breast <eos> take me , — be with me for a moment 's span <eos> i am in love with all unveiled faces <eos> i seek the wonder at the heart of man <eos> i would go up to the far seeing places <eos> while youth is ours , turn toward me for a space <eos> the marvel of your rapture lighted face <eos>
surprised by joy — impatient as the wind <eos> i turned to share the transport — oh ! with whom <eos> but thee , deep buried in the silent tomb <eos> that spot which no vicissitude can find <eos> love , faithful love , recalled thee to my mind <eos> but how could i forget thee ? through what power <eos> even for the least division of an hour <eos> have i been so beguiled as to be blind <eos> to my most grievous loss ?— that thought 's return <eos> was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore <eos> save one , one only , when i stood forlorn <eos> knowing my heart 's best treasure was no more <eos> that neither present time , nor years unborn <eos> could to my sight that heavenly face restore <eos>
what , cringe to europe ! band it all in one <eos> stilt its decrepit strength , renew its age <eos> wipe out its debts , contract a loan to wage <eos> its venal battles ,— and , by yon bright sun <eos> our god is false , and liberty undone <eos> if slaves have power to win your heritage <eos> look on your country , god 's appointed stage <eos> where man 's vast mind its boundless course shall run <eos> for that it was your stormy coast he spread <eos> a fear in winter ; girded you about <eos> with granite hills , and made you strong and dread <eos> let him who fears before the foemen shout <eos> or gives an inch before a vein has bled <eos> turn on himself , and let the traitor out <eos>
friend of the dead , and friend of all my days <eos> even since they cast off boyhood , i salute <eos> the song saluting friends whose songs are mute <eos> with full burnt offerings of clear spirited praise <eos> that since our old young years our several ways <eos> have led through fields diverse of flower and fruit <eos> yet no cross wind has once relaxed the root <eos> we set long since beneath the sundawn 's rays <eos> the root of trust whence towered the trusty tree <eos> friendship — this only and duly might impel <eos> my song to salutation of your own <eos> more even than praise of one unseen of me <eos> and loved — the starry spirit of dobell <eos> to mine by light and music only known <eos>
at the round earth 's imagined corners blow <eos> your trumpets , angels ! and arise , arise <eos> from death , you numberless infinities <eos> of souls , and to your scattered bodies go <eos> all whom the flood did , and fire shall , overthrow <eos> all whom war , death , age , ague 's tyrannies <eos> despair , law , chance , hath slain ; and you whose eyes <eos> shall behold god , and never taste death 's woe <eos> but let them sleep , lord ! and me mourn a space <eos> for if above all these my sins abound <eos> ‘ tis late to ask abundance of thy grace <eos> when we are there . here on this holy ground <eos> teach me how to repent , for that 's as good <eos> as if thou hadst sealed my pardon with thy blood <eos>
then shall your works of art superior rise <eos> your fruits perfume a larger length of skies <eos> canals careering climb your sunbright hills <eos> vein the green slopes and strow their nurturing rills <eos> thro tunnel 'd heights and sundering ridges glide <eos> rob the rich west of half kenhawa 's tide <eos> mix your wide climates , all their stores confound <eos> and plant new ports in every midland mound <eos> your lawless missisippi , now who slimes <eos> and drowns and desolates his waste of climes <eos> ribb 'd with your dikes , his torrent shall restrain <eos> and ask your leave to travel to the main <eos> won from his wave while rising cantons smile <eos> rear their glad nations and reward their toil <eos>
one might believe that natural miseries <eos> had blasted france , and made of it a land <eos> unfit for men ; and that in one great band <eos> her sons were bursting forth , to dwell at ease <eos> but ‘ tis a chosen soil , where sun and breeze <eos> shed gentle favors ; rural works are there <eos> and ordinary business without care <eos> spot rich in all things that can soothe and please <eos> how piteous then that there should be such dearth <eos> of knowledge ; that whole myriads should unite <eos> to work against themselves such fell despite <eos> should come in phrenzy and in drunken mirth <eos> impatient to put out the only light <eos> of liberty that yet remains on earth <eos>
we lack , yet cannot fix upon the lack <eos> not this , nor that ; yet somewhat , certainly <eos> we see the things we do not yearn to see <eos> around us : and what see we glancing back <eos> lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack <eos> hopes that were never ours yet seemed to be <eos> for which we steered on life 's salt stormy sea <eos> braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack <eos> if thus to look behind is all in vain <eos> and all in vain to look to left or right <eos> why face we not our future once again <eos> launching with hardier hearts across the main <eos> straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight <eos> and strong to bear ourselves in patient pain <eos>
the kind instructor in these words began <eos> “ ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now <eos> i ’ th ’ second round , and shalt be , till thou come <eos> upon the horrid sand : look therefore well <eos> around thee , and such things thou shalt behold <eos> as would my speech discredit . ” on all sides <eos> i heard sad plainings breathe , and none could see <eos> from whom they might have issu 'd . in amaze <eos> fast bound i stood . he , as it seem 'd , believ 'd <eos> that i had thought so many voices came <eos> from some amid those thickets close conceal 'd <eos> and thus his speech resum 'd : “ if thou lop off <eos> a single twig from one of those ill plants <eos> the thought thou hast conceiv 'd shall vanish quite <eos>
because i feel that , in the heavens above <eos> the angels , whispering to one another <eos> can find , among their burning terms of love <eos> none so devotional as that of “ mother <eos> therefore by that dear name i long have called you <eos> you who are more than mother unto me <eos> and fill my heart of hearts , where death installed you <eos> in setting my virginia 's spirit free <eos> my mother — my own mother , who died early <eos> was but the mother of myself ; but you <eos> are mother to the one i loved so dearly <eos> and thus are dearer than the mother i knew <eos> by that infinity with which my wife <eos> was dearer to my soul than its soul life <eos>
as some poor starveling at a palace gate <eos> sees curtained gleams from banquet litten halls <eos> hears song out ringing from the festal walls <eos> scents viands that shall princely palates sate <eos> yet in the outer gloom may only wait <eos> crouched in the cold , thrice thankful for some least <eos> mean morsel flung him from the plenteous feast <eos> poor bondman to the ball and chain of fate <eos> so , lonely at love 's outer gate i stand <eos> and glimpse the brightness and the bliss within <eos> where love lit smiles transmute the dark to day <eos> i wait without — i may not enter in <eos> long , wistfully , i gaze — then void of hand <eos> and starved of spirit , sadly turn away <eos>
what wonder strikes the curious , while he views <eos> the black ant 's city , by a rotten tree <eos> or woodland bank ! in ignorance we muse <eos> pausing , annoyed ,— we know not what we see <eos> such government and thought there seem to be <eos> some looking on , and urging some to toil <eos> dragging their loads of bent stalks slavishly <eos> and what 's more wonderful , when big loads foil <eos> one ant or two to carry , quickly then <eos> a swarm flock round to help their fellow men <eos> surely they speak a language whisperingly <eos> too fine for us to hear ; and sure their ways <eos> prove they have kings and laws , and that they be <eos> deformed remnants of the fairy days <eos>
yet , being so chill 'd , do we not chide the sun <eos> and say he wilful hides his face away <eos> say ‘ tis his will makes the world drear and dun <eos> and takes the golden glory from the day <eos> the envious rack we rather should reproach <eos> that comes betwixt us in despite of him <eos> rebellious powers , that on his reign encroach <eos> and , black themselves , his brightness joy to dim <eos> so when the troubling mischiefs of the time <eos> or baser minds , bent upon marring thee <eos> stole moments of thy favour , then my rhyme <eos> slander 'd thy love and slurr 'd thy constancy <eos> yet the sun 's self unstain 'd and bright remains <eos> and my heart knew thy stains were not thy stains <eos>
“ not without purpose once more to return <eos> thou find'st me , my casella , where i am <eos> journeying this way ; ” i said , “ but how of thee <eos> hath so much time been lost ? ” he answer 'd straight <eos> “ no outrage hath been done to me , if he <eos> who when and whom he chooses takes , me oft <eos> this passage hath denied , since of just will <eos> his will he makes . these three months past indeed <eos> he , whose chose to enter , with free leave <eos> hath taken ; whence i wand'ring by the shore <eos> where tyber 's wave grows salt , of him gain 'd kind <eos> admittance , at that river 's mouth , tow'rd which <eos> his wings are pointed , for there always throng <eos> all such as not to archeron descend <eos>
vii . and how shall he whose mission is to bring <eos> the soul to worship at its rightful shrine <eos> seeing in beauty what is most divine <eos> give out the mightiest impulse , and thus fling <eos> his soul into the future , scattering <eos> the living seed of wisdom ? shall there shine <eos> from underneath his hand a matchless line <eos> of high earth beauties , till the wide world ring <eos> with the far clang that tells a missioned soul <eos> kneeling to homage all about his feet <eos> alas for such a gift were this the whole <eos> the only bread of life men had to eat <eos> lo , i behold them dead about him now <eos> and him the heart of death , for all that brow <eos>
clear as of old the great voice rings to day <eos> while sherwood 's oak leaves twine with aldworth 's bay <eos> the voice of him the master and the sire <eos> of one whole age and legion of the lyre <eos> who sang his morning song when coleridge still <eos> uttered dark oracles from highgate hill <eos> and with new launch è d argosies of rhyme <eos> gilds and makes brave this sombreing tide of time <eos> far be the hour when lesser brows shall wear <eos> the laurel glorious from that wintry hair <eos> when he , the sovereign of our lyric day <eos> in charon 's shallop must be rowed away <eos> and hear , scarce heeding , ‘ mid the plash of oar <eos> the ave atque vale from the shore <eos>
where is the painter who shall paint for you <eos> my austral brothers , with a pencil steeped <eos> in hues of truth , the weather smitten crew <eos> who gazed on unknown shores — a thoughtful few <eos> what time the heart of their great leader leaped <eos> till he was faint with pain of longing ? new <eos> and wondrous sights on each and every hand <eos> like strange supernal visions , grew and grew <eos> until the rocks and trees , and sea and sand <eos> danced madly in the tear bewildered view <eos> and from the surf a fierce , fantastic band <eos> of startled wild men to the hills withdrew <eos> with yells of fear ! who 'll paint thy face , o cook <eos> turned seaward , “ after many a wistful look <eos>
still , resignation was my dearest friend <eos> and reason pointed to a glorious end <eos> with anxious sighs , a parent 's hopes and pride <eos> i wish 'd to live — i trust i could have died <eos> but winter 's clouds pursu 'd their stormy way <eos> and march brought sunshine with the length'ning day <eos> and bade my heart arise , that morn and night <eos> now throbb 'd with irresistible delight <eos> delightful ‘ twas to leave disease behind <eos> and feel the renovation of the mind <eos> to lead abroad upborne on pleasure 's wing <eos> our children , midst the glories of the spring <eos> our fellow sufferers , our only wealth <eos> to gather daisies in the breeze of health <eos>
the frog half fearful jumps across the path <eos> and little mouse that leaves its hole at eve <eos> nimbles with timid dread beneath the swath <eos> my rustling steps awhile their joys deceive <eos> till past ,— and then the cricket sings more strong <eos> and grasshoppers in merry moods still wear <eos> the short night weary with their fretting song <eos> up from behind the molehill jumps the hare <eos> cheat of his chosen bed , and from the bank <eos> the yellowhammer flutters in short fears <eos> from off its nest hid in the grasses rank <eos> and drops again when no more noise it hears <eos> thus nature 's human link and endless thrall <eos> proud man , still seems the enemy of all <eos>
what say'st thou , dobbin ? what though hounds await <eos> with open jaws the moment of thy fate <eos> no better fate attends his public race <eos> his life is misery , and his end disgrace <eos> then freely bear thy burden to the mill <eos> obey but one short law ,... thy driver 's will <eos> affection , to thy memory ever true <eos> shall boast of mighty loads that dobbin drew <eos> and back to childhood shall the mind with pride <eos> recount thy gentleness in many a ride <eos> to pond , or field , or village fair , when thou <eos> held'st high thy braided mane and comely brow <eos> and oft the tale shall rise to homely fame <eos> upon thy gen'rous spirit and thy name <eos>
“ let her be free and natural as the flowers <eos> that smile and nod throughout the summer hours <eos> let her rejoice in all the joys of youth <eos> but first impress upon her mind this truth <eos> no lasting happiness is e'er attained <eos> save when the heart some other seeks to please <eos> the cup of selfish pleasures soon is drained <eos> and full of gall and bitterness the lees <eos> next to her god , teach her to love her land <eos> in her young bosom light the patriot 's flame <eos> until the heart within her shall expand <eos> with love and fervor at her country 's name <eos> “ no coward mother bears a valiant son <eos> and this , my last wish , is an earnest one <eos>
daughter of her whose face , and lofty name <eos> prenuptial , of old states and cities speak <eos> where lands of wine look north to peak on peak <eos> of the overwatching alps : through her , you claim <eos> kinship with vanished power , unvanished fame <eos> and midst a world grown colorless and bleak <eos> i see the blood of doges in your cheek <eos> and in your hair the titian tints of flame <eos> daughter of england too , you first drew breath <eos> where our coy springs to our coy summers yield <eos> and you descend from one whose lance and shield <eos> were with the grandsire of elizabeth <eos> when the plantagenet saw the avenger death <eos> toward him spurring over bosworth field <eos>

the time will come when a diviner flame <eos> shall warm my breast to sing of c æ sar 's fame <eos> meanwhile , permit that my preluding muse <eos> in theban wars an humbler theme may choose <eos> of furious hate surviving death she sings <eos> a fatal throne to two contending kings <eos> and funeral flames , that , parting wide in air <eos> express the discord of the souls they bear <eos> of towns dispeopled , and the wandering ghosts <eos> of kings unburied in the wasted coasts <eos> when dirce 's fountain blush 'd with grecian blood <eos> and thetis , near ismenos ’ swelling flood <eos> with dread beheld the rolling surges sweep <eos> in heaps his slaughter 'd sons into the deep <eos>

then rode geraint into the castle court <eos> his charger trampling many a prickly star <eos> of sprouted thistle on the broken stones <eos> he looked and saw that all was ruinous <eos> here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern <eos> and here had fallen a great part of a tower <eos> whole , like a crag that tumbles from the cliff <eos> and like a crag was gay with wilding flowers <eos> and high above a piece of turret stair <eos> worn by the feet that now were silent , wound <eos> bare to the sun , and monstrous ivy stems <eos> claspt the gray walls with hairy fibred arms <eos> and sucked the joining of the stones , and looked <eos> a knot , beneath , of snakes , aloft , a grove <eos>
he walked with god , by faith , in solitude <eos> at early dawn or tranquil eventide <eos> in some lone leafy place he would abide <eos> till his whole being was with god imbued <eos> he walked with god amid the multitude <eos> no threats or smiles could his firm soul divide <eos> from that beloved presence at his side <eos> whose still small voice silenced earth 's noises rude <eos> boldly abroad to men he testified <eos> how “ the lord cometh ” and the judgment brings <eos> gently at home he trained his “ sons and daughters <eos> till , praying , a bright chariot he espied <eos> sent to translate him , as on angels ’ wings <eos> to walk with god beside heaven 's “ living waters <eos>
so reuben 's life in full leaf stood , its fruit <eos> hidden in a green expectancy ; but all <eos> his days were rounded with ripe consciousness <eos> while jerry felt the winter 's whitening blight <eos> as when that frosty fern work and those palms <eos> of visionary leaf , and trailing vines <eos> quaint chased by night winds on the pane , melt off <eos> and naked earth , stone stiff , with bristling trees <eos> stares in the winter sunlight coldly through <eos> but yet he rose , and clothed himself amain <eos> with misery , and once more put on life <eos> as a stained garment . highly he resolved <eos> to make his deedless days henceforward strike <eos> pure harmony — a psalm of silences <eos>
the fairer riddles come from out the night <eos> the richer is the world his arms enclose <eos> the broader stream the sea with which he flows <eos> the weaker , too , is destiny 's blind might <eos> the nobler instincts does he prove <eos> the smaller he himself , the greater grows his love <eos> thus is he led , in still and hidden race <eos> by poetry , who strews his path with flowers <eos> through ever purer forms , and purer powers <eos> through ever higher heights , and fairer grace <eos> at length , arrived at the ripe goal of time <eos> yet one more inspiration all sublime <eos> poetic outburst of man 's latest youth <eos> and — he will glide into the arms of truth <eos>
from fairest creatures we desire increase <eos> that thereby beauty 's rose might never die <eos> but as the riper should by time decease <eos> his tender heir might bear his memory <eos> but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes <eos> feed'st thy light 's flame with self substantial fuel <eos> making a famine where abundance lies <eos> thy self thy foe , to thy sweet self too cruel <eos> thou that art now the world 's fresh ornament <eos> and only herald to the gaudy spring <eos> within thine own bud buriest thy content <eos> and tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding <eos> pity the world , or else this glutton be <eos> to eat the world 's due , by the grave and thee <eos>
well , as soon as a few weeks was over and gone <eos> the terrible day iv the thrial kem on <eos> there was sich a crowd there was scarce room to stand <eos> the sodgers on guard , the dhragoons sword in hand <eos> an ’ the court house so full that the people were bothered <eos> attorneys an ’ criers were just upon smothered <eos> an ’ counsellers almost gev over for dead <eos> the jury sat up in their box overhead <eos> an ’ the judge on the bench so detarmined an ’ big <eos> with his gown on his back , and an illigent wig <eos> then silence was called , and the minute ‘ twas said <eos> the court was as still as the heart of the dead <eos> an ’ they heard but the turn of a key in a lock <eos> an ’ shamus o'brien kem into the dock <eos>

when mourn the dark winds o'er the lonely plain <eos> and from pale noon sinks , ere the fifth cold hour <eos> the transient light , imagination 's power <eos> with knowledge , and with science in her train <eos> not unpropitious hyems ’ icy reign <eos> perceives ; since in the deep and silent lour <eos> high themes the rapt concent'ring thoughts explore <eos> freed from external pleasure 's glittering chain <eos> then most the understanding 's culture pays <eos> luxuriant harvest , nor shall folly bring <eos> her aids obtrusive .— then , with ardent gaze <eos> the ingenious to their rich resources spring <eos> while sullen winter 's dull imprisoning days <eos> hang on the vacant mind with flagging wing <eos>
by this the widow had unbarr 'd the door <eos> and chanticleer went strutting out before <eos> with royal courage , and with heart so light <eos> as show 'd he scorned the visions of the night <eos> now roaming in the yard , he spurn 'd the ground <eos> and gave to partlet the first grain he found <eos> then often feather 'd her with wanton play <eos> and trod her twenty times ere prime of day <eos> and took by turns , and gave , so much delight <eos> her sisters pined with envy at the sight <eos> he chuck 'd again , when other corns he found <eos> and scarcely deign 'd to set a foot to ground <eos> but swagger 'd like a lord about his hall <eos> and his seven wives came running at his call <eos>

his shadow to narcissus well presented <eos> how fair he was by such attractive love <eos> so if thou would'st thyself thy beauty prove <eos> vulgar breath mirrors might have well contented <eos> and to their prayers eternally consented <eos> oaths , vows and sighs , if they believe might move <eos> but more thou forc'st , making my pen approve <eos> thy praise to all , least any had dissented <eos> when this hath wrought , thou which before wert known <eos> but unto some , of all art now required <eos> and thine eyes ’ wonders wronged , because not shown <eos> the world , with daily orisons desired <eos> thy chaste fair gifts , with learning 's breath is blown <eos> and thus my pen hath made thy sweets admired <eos>

here pock marked black beard covenanted bonnet <eos> to slit the dons ’ throats at st. augustine <eos> and bussed light ladies , unknown to this sonnet <eos> whose names , no doubt , would rime with magdalene <eos> and english parsons , who had lost their fames <eos> sat tippling wine as spicy as their joke <eos> larding bald texts with bets on cocking mains <eos> and whiffing pipes churchwardens used to smoke <eos> here macaronis , hands a droop with laces <eos> dealt knave to knave in picquet or é cart é, <eos> in coats no whit less scarlet than their faces <eos> while bullies hiccuped healths to king and party <eos> and yankee slavers , in from barbadoes <eos> drove flinty bargains with keen huguenots <eos>

the winter wind is raving fierce and shrill <eos> and chides with angry moan the frosty skies <eos> the white stars gaze with sleepless gorgon eyes <eos> that freeze the earth in terror fixed and still <eos> we reck not of the wild night 's gloom and chill <eos> housed from its rage , dear friend ; and fancy flies <eos> lured by the hand of beckoning memories <eos> back to those summer evenings on the hill <eos> where we together watched the sun go down <eos> beyond the gold washed uplands , while his fires <eos> touched into glittering life the vanes and spires <eos> piercing the purpling mists that veiled the town <eos> the wintry night thy voice and eyes beguile <eos> till wake the sleeping summers in thy smile <eos>
the dame , it is true , would mutter “ shocking <eos> and give her head a sorrowful rocking <eos> and make a clucking with palate and tongue <eos> like the call of partlet to gather her young <eos> a sound , when human , that always proclaims <eos> at least a thousand pities and shames <eos> but still the darker the tale of sin <eos> like certain folks , when calamities burst <eos> who find a comfort in “ hearing the worst <eos> the farther she poked the trumpet in <eos> nay , worse , whatever she heard , she spread <eos> east and west , and north and south <eos> like the ball which , according to captain z <eos> went in at his ear , and came out at his mouth <eos>
i grieve not that ripe knowledge takes away <eos> the charm that nature to my childhood wore <eos> for , with that insight , cometh , day by day <eos> a greater bliss than wonder was before <eos> the real doth not clip the poet 's wings <eos> to win the secret of a weed 's plain heart <eos> reveals some clue to spiritual things <eos> and stumbling guess becomes firm footed art <eos> flowers are not flowers unto the poet 's eyes <eos> their beauty thrills him by an inward sense <eos> he knows that outward seemings are but lies <eos> or , at the most , but earthly shadows , whence <eos> the soul that looks within for truth may guess <eos> the presence of some wondrous heavenliness <eos>
pride , the first peer , and president of hell <eos> to his share , spain , the largest province fell <eos> the subtle prince thought fittest to bestow <eos> on these the golden mines of mexico <eos> with all the silver mountains of peru <eos> wealth which in wise hands would the world undo <eos> because he knew their genius was such <eos> too lazy and too haughty to be rich <eos> so proud a people , so above their fate <eos> that , if reduced to beg , they 'll beg in state <eos> lavish of money , to be counted brave <eos> and proudly starve , because they scorn to save <eos> never was nation in the world before <eos> so very rich , and yet so very poor <eos>

through the hushed street , along the silent plain <eos> the spectral future leads its mourning train <eos> dark with the shadows of uncounted bands <eos> where man 's white lips and woman 's wringing hands <eos> track the still burden , rolling slow before <eos> that love and kindness can protect no more <eos> the smiling babe that , called to mortal strife <eos> shuts its meek eyes and drops its little life <eos> the drooping child who prays in vain to live <eos> and pleads for help its parent cannot give <eos> the pride of beauty stricken in its flower <eos> the strength of manhood broken in an hour <eos> age in its weakness , bowed by toil and care <eos> traced in sad lines beneath its silvered hair <eos>
by no dry death another king goes down <eos> the way of kings . yet may no free man 's voice <eos> for stern compassion and deep awe , rejoice <eos> that one sign more is given against the crown <eos> that one more head those dark red waters drown <eos> which rise round thrones whose trembling equipoise <eos> is propped on sand and bloodshed and such toys <eos> as human hearts that shrink at human frown <eos> the name writ red on polish earth , the star <eos> that was to outshine our england 's in the far <eos> east heaven of empire — where is one that saith <eos> proud words now , prophesying of this white czar <eos> “ in bloodless pangs few kings yield up their breath <eos> few tyrants perish by no violent death <eos>

let the world 's sharpness like a clasping knife <eos> shut in upon itself and do no harm <eos> in this close hand of love , now soft and warm <eos> and let us hear no sound of human strife <eos> after the click of the shutting . life to life <eos> i lean upon thee , dear , without alarm <eos> and feel as safe as guarded by a charm <eos> against the stab of worldlings , who if rife <eos> are weak to injure . very whitely still <eos> the lilies of our lives may reassure <eos> their blossoms from their roots , accessible <eos> alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer <eos> growing straight , out of man 's reach , on the hill <eos> god only , who made us rich , can make us poor <eos>

maid with the poppies , must i let thee go <eos> alas , i may not ; thou art likewise dear <eos> i am but human , and thou hast a tear <eos> when she hath nought but splendour , and the glow <eos> of a wild energy that mocks the flow <eos> of the poor sympathies which keep us here <eos> lay past thy poppies , and come twice as near <eos> and i will teach thee , and thou too shalt grow <eos> and thou shalt walk with me in open day <eos> through the rough thoroughfares with quiet grace <eos> and the wild visaged maid shall lead the way <eos> timing her footsteps to a gentler pace <eos> as her great orbs turn ever on thy face <eos> drinking in draughts of loving help alway <eos>
why art thou silent ? is thy love a plant <eos> of such weak fibre that the treacherous air <eos> of absence withers what was once so fair <eos> is there no debt to pay , no boon to grant <eos> yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant <eos> bound to thy service with unceasing care <eos> the mind 's least generous wish a mendicant <eos> for naught but what thy happiness could spare <eos> speak !— though this soft warm heart , once free to hold <eos> a thousand tender pleasures , thine and mine <eos> be left more desolate , more dreary cold <eos> than a forsaken bird'shyppphennest filled with snow <eos> ‘ mid its own bush of leafless eglantine <eos> speak , that my torturing doubts their end may know <eos>
friend , whom thy fourscore winters leave more dear <eos> than when life 's roseate summer on thy cheek <eos> burned in the flush of manhood 's manliest year <eos> lonely , how lonely ! is the snowy peak <eos> thy feet have reached , and mine have climbed so near <eos> close on thy footsteps ‘ mid the landscape drear <eos> i stretch my hand thine answering grasp to seek <eos> warm with the love no rippling rhymes can speak <eos> look backward ! from thy lofty height survey <eos> thy years of toil , of peaceful victories won <eos> of dreams made real , largest hopes outrun <eos> look forward ! brighter than earth 's morning ray <eos> streams the pure light of heaven 's unsetting sun <eos> the unclouded dawn of life 's immortal day <eos>
them virgil answer 'd . “ ye suppose perchance <eos> us well acquainted with this place : but here <eos> we , as yourselves , are strangers . not long erst <eos> we came , before you but a little space <eos> by other road so rough and hard , that now <eos> the ’ ascent will seem to us as play . ” the spirits <eos> who from my breathing had perceiv 'd i liv 'd <eos> grew pale with wonder . as the multitude <eos> flock round a herald , sent with olive branch <eos> to hear what news he brings , and in their haste <eos> tread one another down , e'en so at sight <eos> of me those happy spirits were fix 'd , each one <eos> forgetful of its errand , to depart <eos> where cleans 'd from sin , it might be made all fair <eos>
to whom the queen ( whilst yet in pensive mind <eos> was in the silent gates of sleep confined <eos> “ o sister to my soul forever dear <eos> why this first visit to reprove my fear <eos> how in a realm so distant should you know <eos> from what deep source ceaseless sorrows flow <eos> to all my hope my royal lord is lost <eos> his country 's buckler , and the grecian boast <eos> and with consummate woe to weigh me down <eos> the heir of all his honours and his crown <eos> my darling son is fled ! an easy prey <eos> to the fierce storms , or men more fierce than they <eos> who , in a league of blood associates sworn <eos> will intercept the unwary youth 's return <eos>
i would not if i could undo my past <eos> tho ’ for its sake my future is a blank <eos> my past , for which i have myself to thank <eos> for all its faults and follies first and last <eos> i would not cast anew the lot once cast <eos> or launch a second ship for one that sank <eos> or drug with sweets the bitterness i drank <eos> or break by feasting my perpetual fast <eos> i would not if i could : for much more dear <eos> is one remembrance than a hundred joys <eos> more than a thousand hopes in jubilee <eos> dearer the music of one tearful voice <eos> that unforgotten calls and calls to me <eos> ‘ follow me here , rise up , and follow here <eos>
one vast creation , lately borne abroad <eos> cheers the young nations like a nurturing god <eos> breathes thro them all the same wide searching soul <eos> forms , feeds , refines and animates the whole <eos> guards every ground they gain , and forward brings <eos> glad science soaring on cerulean wings <eos> trims her gay plumes , directs her upward course <eos> props her light pinions and sustains her force <eos> instructs all men her golden gifts to prize <eos> and catch new glories from her beamful eyes <eos> tis the prolific press ; whose tablet , fraught <eos> by graphic genius with his painted thought <eos> flings forth by millions the prodigious birth <eos> and in a moment stocks the astonish 'd earth <eos>
come , come to bed . the shadows move about <eos> and some one seems to overhear our talk <eos> the fire is low ; the candles flicker out <eos> the ghosts of former tenants want to walk <eos> already they are shuffling through the gloom <eos> i felt an old man touch my shoulder blade <eos> once he was married here ; they love this room <eos> he and his woman and the child they made <eos> dead , dead , they are , yet some familiar sound <eos> creeping along the brink of happy life <eos> revives their memory from under ground <eos> the farmer and his troublesome old wife <eos> let us be going : as we climb the stairs <eos> they 'll sit down in our warm half empty chairs <eos>
in yonder cot , along whose mouldering walls <eos> in many a fold the mantling woodbine falls <eos> the village matron kept her little school <eos> gentle of heart , yet knowing well to rule <eos> staid was the dame , and modest was her mien <eos> her garb was coarse , yet whole , and nicely clean <eos> her neatly border 'd cap , as lily fair <eos> beneath her chin was pinn 'd with decent care <eos> and pendent ruffles , of the whitest lawn <eos> of ancient make , her elbows did adorn <eos> faint with old age , and dim were grown her eyes <eos> a pair of spectacles their want supplies <eos> these does she guard secure , in leathern case <eos> from thoughtless wights , in some unweeted place <eos>
dear to my soul , then , leave , me not forsaken <eos> fly not ! my heart within thy bosom sleepeth <eos> even from myself and sense i have betaken <eos> me unto thee for whom my spirit weepeth <eos> and on the shore of that salt teary sea <eos> couched in a bed of unseen seeming pleasure <eos> where in imaginary thoughts thy fair self lay <eos> but being waked , robbed of my life 's best treasure <eos> i call the heavens , air , earth , and seas to hear <eos> my love , my truth , and black disdained estate <eos> beating the rocks with bellowings of despair <eos> which still with plaints my words reverberate <eos> sighing , “ alas , what shall become of me <eos> whilst echo cries , “ what shall become of me <eos>
the silvery sea weed matted round her bed <eos> and distant surges murmuring o'er her head <eos> high in the flood her azure dome ascends <eos> 270 the crystal arch on crystal columns bends <eos> roof 'd with translucent shell the turrets blaze <eos> and far in ocean dart their colour 'd rays <eos> o'er the white floor successive shadows move <eos> as rise and break the ruffled waves above <eos> 275 around the nymph her mermaid trains repair <eos> and weave with orient pearl her radiant hair <eos> with rapid fins she cleaves the watery way <eos> shoots like a diver meteor up to day <eos> sounds a loud conch , convokes a scaly band <eos> 280 her sea born lovers , and ascends the strand <eos>
my love lay sleeping , where birds music made <eos> shutting her eyes , disdainful of the light <eos> the heat was great but greater was the shade <eos> which her defended from his burning sight <eos> this cupid saw , and came a kiss to take <eos> sucking sweet nectar from her sugared breath <eos> she felt the touch , and blushed , and did awake <eos> seeing t'was love , which she did think was death <eos> she cut his wings and caus è d him to stay <eos> making a vow , he should not thence depart <eos> unless to her the wanton boy could pay <eos> the truest , kindest and most loving heart <eos> his feathers still she us è d for a fan <eos> till by exchange my heart his feathers won <eos>
there drew he forth the brand excalibur <eos> and o'er him , drawing it , the winter moon <eos> brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran forth <eos> and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt <eos> for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks <eos> myriads of topaz lights , and jacinth work <eos> of subtlest jewellery . he gazed so long <eos> that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood <eos> this way and that dividing the swift mind <eos> in act to throw : but at the last it seem 'd <eos> better to leave excalibur conceal 'd <eos> there in the many knotted water flags <eos> that whistled stiff and dry about the marge <eos> so strode he back slow to the wounded king <eos>
i saw , or dreamed i saw , her sitting lone <eos> her neck bent like a swan 's , her brown eyes thrown <eos> on some sweet poem — his , i think , who sings <eos> oenone , or the hapless maud : no rings <eos> flashed from the dainty fingers , which held back <eos> her beautiful blonde hair . ah ! would these black <eos> locks of mine own were mingling with it now <eos> and these warm lips were pressed against her brow <eos> and , as she turned a page , methought i heard <eos> hush ! could it be ?— a faintly murmured word <eos> it was so softly dwelt on — such a smile <eos> played on her brow and wreathed her lip the while <eos> that my heart leaped to hear it , and a flame <eos> burned on my forehead — sa'ra !— ‘ t was my name <eos>
if faithful souls be alike glorified <eos> as angels , then my father 's soul doth see <eos> and adds this even to full felicity <eos> that valiantly i hell 's wide mouth o'erstride <eos> but if our minds to these souls be descried <eos> by circumstances and by signs that be <eos> apparent in us — not immediately <eos> how shall my mind 's white truth by them be tried <eos> they see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn <eos> and , style blasphemous , conjurors to call <eos> on jesu 's name , and pharisaical <eos> dissemblers feign devoti ö n . then turn <eos> o pensive soul , to god ; for he knows best <eos> thy grief , for he put it into my breast <eos>
thus having spoke , the unknown celestial leads <eos> the footsteps of the duty he treads <eos> and secret moves along the crowded space <eos> unseen of all the rude phaeacian race <eos> ( so pallas order 'd , pallas to their eyes <eos> the mist objected , and condensed the skies <eos> the chief with wonder sees the extended streets <eos> the spreading harbours , and the riding fleets <eos> he next their princes ’ lofty domes admires <eos> in separate islands , crown 'd with rising spires <eos> and deep entrenchments , and high walls of stone <eos> that gird the city like a marble zone <eos> at length the kingly palace gates he view 'd <eos> there stopp 'd the goddess , and her speech renew 'd <eos>

it hath been heretofore my chance to see <eos> horsemen with martial order shifting camp <eos> to onset sallying , or in muster rang 'd <eos> or in retreat sometimes outstretch 'd for flight <eos> light armed squadrons and fleet foragers <eos> scouring thy plains , arezzo ! have i seen <eos> and clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts <eos> now with the sound of trumpets , now of bells <eos> tabors , or signals made from castled heights <eos> and with inventions multiform , our own <eos> or introduc 'd from foreign land ; but ne'er <eos> to such a strange recorder i beheld <eos> in evolution moving , horse nor foot <eos> nor ship , that tack 'd by sign from land or star <eos>

men have i seen , and seen with wonderment <eos> noble in form , “ lift upward and divine <eos> in whom i yet must search , as in a mine <eos> after that soul of theirs , by which they went <eos> alive upon the earth . and i have bent <eos> regard on many a woman , who gave sign <eos> god willed her beautiful , when he drew the line <eos> that shaped each float and fold of beauty 's tent <eos> her soul , alas , chambered in pigmy space <eos> left the fair visage pitiful — inane <eos> poor signal only of a coming face <eos> when from the penetrale she filled the fane <eos> possessed of thee was every form of thine <eos> thy very hair replete with the divine <eos>
nay , we are children : we will not mature <eos> a blessed gift must seem a theft ; and tears <eos> must storm our eyes when but a joy appears <eos> in drear disguise of sorrow ; and how poor <eos> we seem when we are richest ,— most secure <eos> against all poverty the lifelong years <eos> we yet must waste in childish doubts and fears <eos> that , in despite of reason , still endure <eos> alas ! the sermon of the rose we will <eos> not wisely ponder ; nor the sobs of grief <eos> lulled into sighs of rapture ; nor the cry <eos> of fierce defiance that again is still <eos> be patient — patient with our frail belief <eos> and stay it yet a little ere we die <eos>

like as the spotless ermelin distressed <eos> circumpassed round with filth and lothsome mud <eos> pines in her grief , imprisoned to her nest <eos> and cannot issue forth to seek her good <eos> so i invironed with a hatefull want <eos> look to the heavens ; the heavens yield forth no grace <eos> i search the earth , the earth i find as scant <eos> i view myself , myself in wofull case <eos> heaven nor earth will not , myself cannot make <eos> a way through want to free my soul from care <eos> but i must pine , and in my pining lurk <eos> lest my sad looks bewray me how i fare <eos> my fortune mantled with a cloud s'obscure <eos> thus shades my life so long as wants endure <eos>
in robes of tyrian blue the king was drest <eos> a jewelled collar shone upon his breast <eos> a giant ruby glittered in his crown <eos> lord of rich lands and many a splendid town <eos> in him the glories of an ancient line <eos> of sober kings , who ruled by right divine <eos> were centred ; and to him with loyal awe <eos> the people looked for leadership and law <eos> ten thousand knights , the safeguard of the land <eos> were like a single sword within his hand <eos> a hundred courts , with power of life and death <eos> proclaimed decrees of justice by his breath <eos> and all the sacred growths that men had known <eos> of order and of rule upheld his throne <eos>

“ was the prophecy fulfilled <eos> the sullen disc of the declining sun <eos> was crimson with a curse and a portent <eos> and scarce his angry ray lit up the land <eos> that lay below , whose lurid gloom appeared <eos> freaked with a moving mist , which , reeking up <eos> from dim tarns hateful with a horrid ban <eos> took shapes forbidden and without a name <eos> gigantic night birds , rising from the reeds <eos> with cries discordant , startled all the air <eos> and bodiless voices babbled in the gloom <eos> but not to me came any voice again <eos> and , covering my face with thin , dead hands <eos> i wept , and woke , and cried aloud to god <eos>
so saying , she bethought her suddenly <eos> or feigned to have bethought her suddenly <eos> how she had left the lute that afternoon <eos> lying upon an arbour seat , when she <eos> grew tired of fingering the strings of it <eos> down in the garden , where she wont to walk <eos> her lute loquacious to the trees ’ deaf trunks <eos> and angelo , right glad to render her <eos> such little graceful offices of love <eos> and gladder yet with hope to hear her sing <eos> who had denied his asking many a time <eos> awaited not another word , but rose <eos> and said , “ myself will bring it , ” and before <eos> she could assent or disapprove , was gone <eos>
when all my trivial rhymes are blotted out <eos> vanished our days , so precious and so few <eos> if some should wonder what we were about <eos> and what the little happenings we knew <eos> i wish that they might know how , night by night <eos> my pencil , heavy in the sleepy hours <eos> sought vainly for some gracious way to write <eos> how much this love is ours , and only ours <eos> how many evenings , as you drowsed to sleep <eos> i read to you by tawny candle glow <eos> and watched you down the valley dim and deep <eos> where poppies and the april flowers grow <eos> then knelt beside your pillow with a prayer <eos> and loved the breath of pansies in your hair <eos>
still flies achilles , but before his eyes <eos> still swift scamander rolls where ’ er he flies <eos> not all his speed escapes the rapid floods <eos> the first of men , but not a match for gods <eos> oft as he turn ’ d the torrent to oppose <eos> and bravely try if all the powers were foes <eos> so oft the surge , in watery mountains spread <eos> beats on his back , or bursts upon his head <eos> yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves <eos> and still indignant bounds above the waves <eos> tired by the tides , his knees relax with toil <eos> wash ’ d from beneath him slides the slimy soil <eos> when thus ( his eyes on heaven ’ s expansion thrown <eos> forth bursts the hero with an angry groan <eos>
and when thereafter to my father 's house <eos> the holidays returned me , there to find <eos> that golden store of books which i had left <eos> what joy was mine ! how often in the course <eos> of those glad respites , though a soft west wind <eos> ruffled the waters to the angler 's wish <eos> for a whole day together , have i lain <eos> down by thy side , o derwent ! murmuring stream <eos> on the hot stones , and in the glaring sun <eos> and there have read , devouring as i read <eos> defrauding the day 's glory , desperate <eos> till with a sudden bound of smart reproach <eos> such as an idler deals with in his shame <eos> i to the sport betook myself again <eos>
vast chaos , of eld , was god 's dominion <eos> ‘ twas his beloved child , his own first born <eos> and he was aged ere the thought of morn <eos> shook the sheer steeps of dim oblivion <eos> then all the works of darkness being done <eos> through countless aeons hopelessly forlorn <eos> out to the very utmost verge and bourne <eos> god at the last , reluctant , made the sun <eos> he loved his darkness still , for it was old <eos> he grieved to see his eldest child take flight <eos> and when his fiat lux the death knell tolled <eos> as the doomed darkness backward by him rolled <eos> he snatched a remnant flying into light <eos> and strewed it with the stars , and called it night <eos>
the marvel of the ne'er familiar day <eos> sacred investiture of life renewed <eos> the chrism of dew , the coronal of flame <eos> low in the valley lies the conquered rout <eos> of man 's poor , trivial turmoil , lost and drowned <eos> under the mist , in gleaming rivers rolled <eos> where oozy marsh contends with frothing main <eos> and rounding all , springs one full , ambient arch <eos> one great good limpid world — so still , so still <eos> for no sound echoes from its crystal curve <eos> save four clear notes , the song of that lone bird <eos> who , brave but trembling , tries his morning hymn <eos> and has no heart to finish , for the awe <eos> and wonder of this pearling globe of dawn <eos>

sylvia my heart in wondrous wise alarm 'd <eos> awed without sense , and without beauty charm 'd <eos> but some odd graces and some flights she had <eos> was just not ugly , and was just not mad <eos> her tongue still ran on credit from her eyes <eos> more pert than witty , more a wit than wise <eos> good nature , she declared it , was her scorn <eos> though ‘ twas by that alone she could be borne <eos> affronting all , yet fond of a good name <eos> a fool to pleasure , yet a slave to fame <eos> now coy , and studious in no point to fall <eos> now all agog for d —— y at a ball <eos> now deep in taylor , and the book of martyrs <eos> now drinking citron with his grace and chartres <eos>
“ excuse me , ” linda answered quietly <eos> “ but i see no resemblance to my father <eos> in you . your features , form , complexion , all <eos> are quite unlike . ” — “ silence ! we 've had enough <eos> “ what did she say ? ” cried harriet . “ do not heed <eos> a word of hers ; leave her and come with me <eos> “ she said , i bear no likeness to my father <eos> you heard her ! ” — “ ‘ twas in malice , harriet <eos> of course she would say that . ” — “ but i must have <eos> that photograph of him upon the wall <eos> ‘ tis unlike any that i 've ever seen <eos> and with the word she took it from the nail <eos> and would have put it in her pocket , had not <eos> linda , with sudden grasp , recovered it <eos>
he comes with vaudeville , with stare and leer <eos> he comes with megaphone and specious cheer <eos> his troupe , too fat or short or long or lean <eos> step from the pages of the magazine <eos> with slapstick or sombrero or with cane <eos> the rube , the cowboy or the masher vain <eos> they over act each part . but at the height <eos> of banter and of canter and delight <eos> the masks fall off for one queer instant there <eos> and show real faces : faces full of care <eos> and desperate longing : love that 's hot or cold <eos> and subtle thoughts , and countenances bold <eos> the masks go back . ‘ tis one more joke . laugh on <eos> the goodly grown up company is gone <eos>
one thinking to encrease the joys of life <eos> marries a beautiful young buxom wife <eos> but soon he finds himself grow cloy 'd and weak <eos> nor can he give her half those joys she 'd take <eos> he now consumptive , pale and meagre grows <eos> while she complaining to her parents goes <eos> says she can n't love him , such a one as he <eos> and now desires she may live sep'rately <eos> the poor fond parents to him trudge in haste <eos> and reprimand him soundly for what 's past <eos> he knows no cause — nor thinks he is to blame <eos> they tell him plainly she shall live with them <eos> and he allow her what is fit to have <eos> which he must yield to if he 'll quiet have <eos>
bowed in the firelight 's softly climbing gleam <eos> i sit a shadow , in a shadow 's place <eos> while through the great , grey window vaguely stream <eos> twilight caresses on each pictured face <eos> that one hour gone was cold in art 's repose <eos> now each still canvas answers tremblingly <eos> till eyes unveil and living spirit glows <eos> where no light was while the rude day went by <eos> and rudest day , that passed so sternly bare <eos> cold as the life that walks without desire <eos> unbeauteous as duty or despair <eos> plucked by a hope that will not set her free <eos> turns back , while memory 's soft , informing fire <eos> falls on her face , and beauty looks at me <eos>

the sex inclined to follow this advice <eos> about receipts however they were not nice <eos> the entertainment greatly was admired <eos> and pure devotion all their bosoms fired <eos> a glass of cordial some apart received <eos> good cheer was given , may be well believed <eos> ten youthful dames brisk friar fripart took <eos> gay , airy , and engaging ev'ry look <eos> who paid with pleasure all the monk could wish <eos> some had fifteen :— some twelve to taste their dish <eos> good friar rock had twenty for his share <eos> and gave such satisfaction to the fair <eos> that some , to show they never grudged the price <eos> and proved their punctuality ,— paid twice <eos>
the lombard custom was , that when the king <eos> who slept not with his queen , ( a common thing <eos> in other countries too ) , desired to greet <eos> his royal consort , and in bed to meet <eos> a night gown solely o'er his back he threw <eos> and then proceeded to the interview <eos> knocked softly at the door , on which a fair <eos> who waited on the queen with anxious care <eos> allowed the prince to enter ; took his light <eos> ( which only glimmered in the midst of night <eos> then put it out , and quickly left the room <eos> a little lantern to dispel the gloom <eos> with waxen taper that emitted rays <eos> in diff'rent countries various are their ways <eos>
awake — arise ! all my stormy powers <eos> the earth , the fair earth , again is ours <eos> at my stern approach , pale autumn flings down <eos> in the dust her broken and faded crown <eos> at my glance the terrified mourner flies <eos> and the earth is filled with her doleful cries <eos> awake !— for the season of flowers is o'er <eos> my white banner unfurl on each northern shore <eos> ye have slumbered long in my icy chain <eos> ye are free to travel the land and main <eos> spirits of frost ! quit your mountains of snow <eos> will ye longer suffer the streams to flow <eos> up , up , and away from your rocky caves <eos> and herald me over the pathless waves <eos>
some , foreign writers , some , our own despise <eos> the ancients only , or the moderns prize <eos> thus wit , like faith , by each man is applied <eos> to one small sect , and all are damn 'd beside <eos> meanly they seek the blessing to confine <eos> and force that sun but on a part to shine <eos> which not alone the southern wit sublimes <eos> but ripens spirits in cold northern climes <eos> which from the first has shone on ages past <eos> enlights the present , and shall warm the last <eos> though each may feel increases and decays <eos> and see now clearer and now darker days <eos> regard not then if wit be old or new <eos> but blame the false , and value still the true <eos>
so greatly gave he , nurturing ‘ gainst the call <eos> of one rare moment all the daily store <eos> of joy distilled from the acquitted task <eos> and that deliberate rashness which bespeaks <eos> the pondered action passed into the blood <eos> so swift to harden purpose into deed <eos> that , with the wind of ruin in his hair <eos> soul sprang full statured from the broken flesh <eos> and at one stroke he lived the whole of life <eos> poured all in one libation to the truth <eos> a brimming flood whose drops shall overflow <eos> on deserts of the soul long beaten down <eos> by the brute hoof of habit , till they spring <eos> in manifold upheaval to the sun <eos>
with arms and legs at work and gentle stroke <eos> that urges switching tail nor mends his pace <eos> on an old ribbed and weather beaten horse <eos> the farmer goes jogtrotting to the fair <eos> both keep their pace that nothing can provoke <eos> followed by brindled dog that snuffs the ground <eos> with urging bark and hurries at his heels <eos> his hat slouched down , and great coat buttoned close <eos> bellied like hooped keg , and chuffy face <eos> red as the morning sun , he takes his round <eos> and talks of stock : and when his jobs are done <eos> and dobbin 's hay is eaten from the rack <eos> he drinks success to corn in language hoarse <eos> and claps old dobbin 's hide , and potters back <eos>
a cloud has lowered that shall not soon pass o'er <eos> the world takes sides : whether for impious aims <eos> with tyranny whose bloody toll enflames <eos> a generous people to heroic war <eos> whether with freedom , stretched in her own gore <eos> whose pleading hands and suppliant distress <eos> still offer hearts that thirst for righteousness <eos> a glorious cause to strike or perish for <eos> england , which side is thine ? thou hast had sons <eos> would shrink not from the choice however grim <eos> were justice trampled on and courage downed <eos> which will they be — cravens or champions <eos> oh , if a doubt intrude , remember him <eos> whose death made missolonghi holy ground <eos>
where shall a sorrow great enough be sought <eos> for this sad ruin which the fates have wrought <eos> unless the fates themselves should weep and wish <eos> their curbless power had been controlled in this <eos> for thy loss , worthiest lord , no mourning eye <eos> has flood enough ; no muse nor elegy <eos> enough expression to thy worth can lend <eos> no , though thy sidney had survived his friend <eos> dead , noble brooke shall be to us a name <eos> of grief and honour still , whose deathless fame <eos> such virtue purchased as makes us to be <eos> unjust to nature in lamenting thee <eos> wailing an old man 's fate as if in pride <eos> and heat of youth he had untimely died <eos>
his speech the tempest of her grief restored <eos> in all he told she recognized her lord <eos> but when the storm was spent in plenteous showers <eos> a pause inspiriting her languish 'd powers <eos> “ o thou , ( she cried ,) whom first inclement fate <eos> made welcome to my hospitable gate <eos> with all thy wants the name of poor shall end <eos> henceforth live honour 'd , my domestic friend <eos> the vest much envied on your native coast <eos> and regal robe with figured gold emboss 'd <eos> in happier hours my artful hand employ 'd <eos> when my loved lord this blissful bower enjoy 'd <eos> the fall of troy erroneous and forlorn <eos> doom 'd to survive , and never to return <eos>
upon a summer 's day love went to swim <eos> and cast himself into a sea of tears <eos> the clouds called in their light , and heaven waxed dim <eos> and sighs did raise a tempest , causing fears <eos> the naked boy could not so wield his arms <eos> but that the waves were masters of his might <eos> and threatened him to work far greater harms <eos> if he devis è d not to scape by flight <eos> then for a boat his quiver stood instead <eos> his bow unbent did serve him for a mast <eos> whereby to sail his cloth of veil he spread <eos> his shafts for oars on either board he cast <eos> from shipwreck safe this wag got thus to shore <eos> and sware to bathe in lovers ’ tears no more <eos>

six thousand veterans practised in war 's game <eos> tried men , at killicranky were arrayed <eos> against an equal host that wore the plaid <eos> shepherds and herdsmen .— like a whirlwind came <eos> the highlanders , the slaughter spread like flame <eos> and garry , thundering down his mountain road <eos> was stopped , and could not breathe beneath the load <eos> of the dead bodies .— ‘ twas a day of shame <eos> for them whom precept and the pedantry <eos> of cold mechanic battle do enslave <eos> o for a single hour of that dundee , [ a <eos> who on that day the word of onset gave <eos> like conquest would the men of england see <eos> and her foes find a like inglorious grave <eos>

an anthem of a sister choristry <eos> and like a windward murmur of the sea <eos> o'er silver shells , so solemnly it falls <eos> a dying music shrouded in deep walls <eos> that bury its wild breathings ! and the moon <eos> of glow worm hue , like virgin in sad swoon <eos> lies coldly on the bosom of a cloud <eos> until the elf winds , that are wailing loud <eos> do minister unto her sickly trance <eos> fanning the life into her countenance <eos> and there are pale stars sparkling , far and few <eos> in the deep chasms of everlasting blue <eos> unmarshall 'd and ungather 'd , one and one <eos> like outposts of the lunar garrison <eos>
not causeless were you christened , gentle flowers <eos> the one of faith , the other fancy 's pride <eos> for she who guides both faith and fancy 's power <eos> in your fair colors wraps her ivory side <eos> as one of you hath whiteness without stain <eos> so spotless is my love and never tainted <eos> and as the other shadoweth faith again <eos> such is my lass , with no fond change acquainted <eos> and as nor tyrant sun nor winter weather <eos> may ever change sweet amaranthus ’ hue <eos> so she though love and fortune join together <eos> will never leave to be both fair and true <eos> and should i leave thee then , thou pretty elf <eos> nay , first let damon quite forget himself <eos>
“ big joss and little zeno , pray come here <eos> look now — how dreadful ! can i help but fear <eos> madame mahaud was speaker . moonlight there <eos> caressingly enhanced her beauty rare <eos> making it shine and tremble , as if she <eos> so soft and gentle were of things that be <eos> of air created , and are brought and ta'en <eos> by heavenly flashes . now , she spoke again <eos> “ certes , ‘ tis heavy purchase of a throne <eos> to pass the night here utterly alone <eos> had you not slyly come to guard me now <eos> i should have died of fright outright i know <eos> the moonbeams through the open door did fall <eos> and shine upon the figure next the wall <eos>
eight hours ’ , ten hours ’ , twelve hours ’ shift <eos> oh , it 's long and long the day is <eos> up before light , and home in the night <eos> that is our share in the desperate fight <eos> and it 's long and long the day is <eos> backs and arms and heads that ache <eos> eyes over tired and legs that shake <eos> and hearts full nigh to burst and break <eos> oh , it 's long and long the day is <eos> week in , week out , not a second to spare <eos> but though it should kill us we 'll do our share <eos> for the sake of the lads , who have gone out there <eos> for the sake of us others , to do and dare <eos> but it 's long and long the day is <eos>
i stood amazed , and saw my licia shine <eos> fairer than phoebus , in his brightest pride <eos> set forth in colors by a hand divine <eos> where naught was wanting but a soul to guide <eos> it was a picture , that i could descry <eos> yet made with art so as it seemed to live <eos> surpassing fair , and yet it had no eye <eos> whereof my senses could no reason give <eos> with that the painter bid me not to muse <eos> “ her eyes are shut , but i deserve no blame <eos> for if she saw , in faith , it could not choose <eos> but that the work had wholly been a flame <eos> then burn me , sweet , with brightness of your eyes <eos> that phoenix like from thence i may arise <eos>
he spoke and sate . the prince with transport flew <eos> hung round his neck , while tears his cheek bedew <eos> nor less the father pour 'd a social flood <eos> they wept abundant , and they wept aloud <eos> as the bold eagle with fierce sorrow stung <eos> or parent vulture , mourns her ravish 'd young <eos> they cry , they scream , their unfledged brood a prey <eos> to some rude churl , and borne by stealth away <eos> so they aloud : and tears in tides had run <eos> their grief unfinish 'd with the setting sun <eos> but checking the full torrent in its flow <eos> the prince thus interrupts the solemn woe <eos> “ what ship transported thee , o father , say <eos> and what bless 'd hands have oar 'd thee on the way <eos>
i once may see when years shall wreck my wrong <eos> and golden hairs shall change to silver wire <eos> and those bright rays that kindle all this fire <eos> shall fail in force , their working not so strong <eos> then beauty , now the burden of my song <eos> whose glorious blaze the world doth so admire <eos> must yield up all to tyrant time 's desire <eos> then fade those flowers that decked her pride so long <eos> when if she grieve to gaze her in her glass <eos> which then presents her whiter withered hue <eos> go you , my verse , go tell her what she was <eos> for what she was , she best shall find in you <eos> your fiery heat lets not her glory pass <eos> but phoenix like shall make her live anew <eos>
lo , the poor indian ! whose untutor 'd mind <eos> sees god in clouds , or hears him in the wind <eos> his soul , proud science never taught to stray <eos> far as the solar walk , or milky way <eos> yet simple nature to his hope has given <eos> behind the cloud topp 'd hill , an humbler heaven <eos> some safer world in depth of woods embraced <eos> some happier island in the watery waste <eos> where slaves once more their native land behold <eos> no fiends torment , no christians thirst for gold <eos> to be , contents his natural desire <eos> he asks no angel 's wing , no seraph 's fire <eos> but thinks , admitted to that equal sky <eos> his faithful dog shall bear him company <eos>
from upland slopes i see the cows file by <eos> lowing , great chested , down the homeward trail <eos> by dusking fields and meadows shining pale <eos> with moon tipped dandelions . flickering high <eos> a peevish night hawk in the western sky <eos> beats up into the lucent solitudes <eos> or drops with griding wing . the stilly woods <eos> grow dark and deep and gloom mysteriously <eos> cool night winds creep , and whisper in mine ear <eos> the homely cricket gossips at my feet <eos> from far off pools and wastes of reeds i hear <eos> clear and soft piped , the chanting frogs break sweet <eos> in full pandean chorus . one by one <eos> shine out the stars , and the great night comes on <eos>
an old , mad , blind , despised , and dying king <eos> princes , the dregs of their dull race , who flow <eos> through public scorn ,— mud from a muddy spring <eos> rulers who neither see , nor feel , nor know <eos> but leech like to their fainting country cling <eos> till they drop , blind in blood , without a blow <eos> a people starved and stabbed in the untilled field <eos> an army , which liberticide and prey <eos> makes as a two edged sword to all who wield <eos> golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay <eos> religion christless , godless — a book sealed <eos> a senate ,— time 's worst statute , unrepealed <eos> are graves from which a glorious phantom may <eos> burst , to illumine our tempestuous day <eos>
i hope and fear , i pray and hold my peace <eos> now freeze my thoughts and straight they fry again <eos> i now admire and straight my wonders cease <eos> i loose my bonds and yet myself restrain <eos> this likes me most that leaves me discontent <eos> my courage serves and yet my heart doth fail <eos> my will doth climb whereas my hopes are spent <eos> i laugh at love , yet when he comes i quail <eos> the more i strive , the duller bide i still <eos> i would be thralled , and yet i freedom love <eos> i would redress , yet hourly feed mine ill <eos> i would repine , and dare not once reprove <eos> and for my love i am bereft of power <eos> and strengthless strive my weakness to devour <eos>
while i gazed on that fair one 's cheek , a shade <eos> of thought , or care , stole softly over <eos> like that by a cloud in a summer 's day made <eos> looking down on a field of blossoming clover <eos> the rose yet lay on her cheek , but its flush <eos> had something lost of its brilliant blush <eos> and the light in her eye , and the light on the wheels <eos> that marched so calmly round above her <eos> was a little dimmed — as when evening steals <eos> upon noon 's hot face :— yet one could n't but love her <eos> for she looked like a mother whose first babe lay <eos> rocked on her breast , as she swung all day <eos> and she seemed in the same silver ’ tone to say <eos> “ passing away ! passing away <eos>
a hilltop sought by every soothing breeze <eos> that loves the melody of murmuring boughs <eos> cool shades , green acreage , and antique house <eos> fronting the ocean and the dawn ; than these <eos> old monks built never for the spirit 's ease <eos> cloisters more calm — not cluny nor clairvaux <eos> sweet are the noises from the bay below <eos> and cuckoos calling in the tulip trees <eos> here , a yet empty suitor in thy train <eos> beloved poesy , great joy was mine <eos> to while a listless spell of summer days <eos> happier than hoarder in each evening 's gain <eos> when evenings found me richer by one line <eos> one verse well turned , or serviceable phrase <eos>
did i not know a great man 's power and might <eos> in spite of innocence can smother right <eos> colour his villainies to get esteem <eos> and make the honest man the villain seem <eos> i know it , and the world doth know ‘ tis true <eos> yet i protest if such a man i knew <eos> that might my country prejudice or thee <eos> were he the greatest or the proudest he <eos> that breathes this day ; if so it might be found <eos> that any good to either might redound <eos> i unappalled , dare in such a case <eos> rip up his foulest crimes before his face <eos> though for my labour i were sure to drop <eos> into the mouth of ruin without hope <eos>
nay , thou hast lost them both , ” the fisher said <eos> and as he spoke a wondrous light was shed <eos> around his form ; he dropped his garments mean <eos> and in his place the river god was seen <eos> “ thy vanity hast brought thee in my power <eos> “ and thou shalt pay the forfeit at this hour <eos> “ for thou hast shown thyself a royal fool <eos> “ too proud to angle , and too vain to rule <eos> “ eager to win in every trivial strife <eos> “ go ! thou shalt fish for minnows all thy life <eos> wrathful , the king the scornful sentence heard <eos> he strove to answer , but he only chirr r ed <eos> his tyrian robe was changed to wings of blue <eos> his crown became a crest ,— away he flew <eos>
remember , man , ‘ the universal cause <eos> acts not by partial , but by general laws <eos> and makes what happiness we justly call <eos> subsist , not in the good of one , but all <eos> there 's not a blessing individuals find <eos> but some way leans and hearkens to the kind <eos> no bandit fierce , no tyrant mad with pride <eos> no cavern 'd hermit , rests self satisfied <eos> who most to shun or hate mankind pretend <eos> seek an admirer , or would fix a friend <eos> abstract what others feel , what others think <eos> all pleasures sicken , and all glories sink <eos> each has his share ; and who would more obtain <eos> shall find , the pleasure pays not half the pain <eos>
sol thro ’ white curtains shot a tim'rous ray <eos> and oped those eyes that must eclipse the day <eos> now lap dogs give themselves the rousing shake <eos> and sleepless lovers , just at twelve , awake <eos> thrice rung the bell , the slipper knock 'd the ground <eos> and the press 'd watch return 'd a silver sound <eos> belinda still her downy pillow prest <eos> her guardian sylph prolong 'd the balmy rest <eos> ‘ twas he had summon 'd to her silent bed <eos> the morning dream that hover 'd o'er her head <eos> a youth more glitt'ring than a birth night beau <eos> ( that ev'n in slumber caus 'd her cheek to glow <eos> seem 'd to her ear his winning lips to lay <eos> and thus in whispers said , or seem 'd to say <eos>
waked by the cries , the athenian chief arose <eos> the knightly forms of combat to dispose <eos> and passing through the obsequious guards , he sate <eos> conspicuous on a throne , sublime in state <eos> there , for the two contending knights he sent <eos> arm 'd cap a pie , with reverence low they bent <eos> he smiled on both , and with superior look <eos> alike their offer 'd adoration took <eos> the people press on every side to see <eos> their awful prince , and hear his high decree <eos> then signing to their heralds with his hand <eos> they gave his orders from their lofty stand <eos> silence is thrice enjoin 'd ; then thus aloud <eos> the king at arms bespeaks the knights and listening crowd <eos>
the holly bush , a sober lump of green <eos> shines through the leafless shrubs all brown and grey <eos> and smiles at winter be it eer so keen <eos> with all the leafy luxury of may <eos> and o it is delicious , when the day <eos> in winter 's loaded garment keenly blows <eos> and turns her back on sudden falling snows <eos> to go where gravel pathways creep between <eos> arches of evergreen that scarce let through <eos> a single feather of the driving storm <eos> and in the bitterest day that ever blew <eos> the walk will find some places still and warm <eos> where dead leaves rustle sweet and give alarm <eos> to little birds that flirt and start away <eos>
stand , thou great bulwark of man 's liberty <eos> thou rock of shelter , rising from the wave <eos> sole refuge to the overwearied brave <eos> who planned , arose , and battled to be free <eos> fell , undeterred , then sadly turned to thee <eos> saved the free spirit from their country 's grave <eos> to rise again , and animate the slave <eos> when god shall ripen all things . britons , ye <eos> who guard the sacred outpost , not in vain <eos> hold your proud peril ! freemen undefiled <eos> keep watch and ward ! let battlements be piled <eos> around your cliffs ; fleets marshalled , till the main <eos> sink under them ; and if your courage wane <eos> through force or fraud , look westward to your child <eos>
the chief hung up :— the princess soon appeared <eos> her spirits presently our champion cheered <eos> the pirate scarcely had her bosom moved <eos> no tears at least a marked affection proved <eos> but , by her prayers she pardon sought to gain <eos> for some who were not in the conflict slain <eos> consoled the dying , and lamented those <eos> who , by the sword , had closed their book of woes <eos> then left the place without the least regret <eos> where such adventures and alarms she 'd met <eos> ‘ tis said , indeed , she presently forgot <eos> the two gallants who last became her lot <eos> and i can easily the fact believe <eos> removed from sight , but few for lovers grieve <eos>
where lies the land to which yon ship must go <eos> festively she puts forth in trim array <eos> as vigorous as a lark at break of day <eos> is she for tropic suns , or polar snow <eos> what boots the enquiry ? neither friend nor foe <eos> she cares for ; let her travel where she may <eos> she finds familiar names , a beaten way <eos> ever before her , and a wind to blow <eos> yet still i ask , what haven is her mark <eos> and , almost as it was when ships were rare <eos> from time to time , like pilgrims , here and there <eos> crossing the waters ; doubt , and something dark <eos> of the old sea some reverential fear <eos> is with me at thy farewell , joyous bark <eos>
the lad most gratefully his thanks returned <eos> his breast with ev'ry soft emotion burned <eos> within a week , to this sweet charmer came <eos> a rich young squire , who soon declared his flame <eos> on which she said to nicaise :— he will do <eos> this spark will easily let matters through <eos> and as the belle was confident of that <eos> she gave consent and listened to his chat <eos> soon all was settled and arranged the day <eos> when marriage they no longer would delay <eos> you 'll fully notice this :— i think i view <eos> the thoughts which move around and you pursue <eos> ‘ twas doubtless clear , whatever bliss in store <eos> the lady was betrothed , and nothing more <eos>
i ask but one thing of you , only one <eos> that always you will be my dream of you <eos> that never shall i wake to find untrue <eos> all this i have believed and rested on <eos> forever vanished , like a vision gone <eos> out into the night . alas , how few <eos> there are who strike in us a chord we knew <eos> existed , but so seldom heard its tone <eos> we tremble at the half forgotten sound <eos> the world is full of rude awakenings <eos> and heaven born castles shattered to the ground <eos> yet still our human longing vainly clings <eos> to a belief in beauty through all wrongs <eos> o stay your hand , and leave my heart its songs <eos>
when she comes home again ! a thousand ways <eos> i fashion , to myself , the tenderness <eos> of my glad welcome : i shall tremble — yes <eos> and touch her , as when first in the old days <eos> i touched her girlish hand , nor dared upraise <eos> mine eyes , such was my faint heart 's sweet distress <eos> then silence : and the perfume of her dress <eos> the room will sway a little , and a haze <eos> cloy eyesight — soul sight , even — for a space <eos> and tears — yes ; and the ache here in the throat <eos> to know that i so ill deserve the place <eos> her arms make for me ; and the sobbing note <eos> i stay with kisses , ere the tearful face <eos> again is hidden in the old embrace <eos>
one do i see and twelve ; but second there <eos> methinks i know thee , thou beloved one <eos> not from thy nobler port , for there are none <eos> more quiet featured : some there are who bear <eos> their message on their brows , while others wear <eos> a look of large commission , nor will shun <eos> the fiery trial , so their work is done <eos> but thou hast parted with thine eyes in prayer <eos> unearthly are they both ; and so thy lips <eos> seem like the porches of the spirit land <eos> for thou hast laid a mighty treasure by <eos> unlocked by him in nature , and thine eye <eos> burns with a vision and apocalypse <eos> thy own sweet soul can hardly understand <eos>
i saw raysde up on yvorie pillowes tall <eos> whose bases were of richest mettalls warke <eos> the chapters * alablaster , the fryses christall <eos> the double front of a triumphall arke <eos> on each side purtraid was a victorie <eos> clad like a nimph , that wings of silver weares <eos> and in triumphant chayre was set on hie <eos> the auncient glory of the romaine peares <eos> no worke it seem 'd of earthly craftsmans wit <eos> but rather wrought by his owne industry <eos> that thunder dartes for iove his syre doth fit <eos> let me no more see faire thing under sky <eos> sith that mine eyes have seene so faire a sight <eos> with sodain fall to dust consumed quight <eos>
thus lysias spoke , and ended . i confess <eos> this story of poor judas touched me much <eos> what horrible revulsions must have passed <eos> across that spirit in those few last hours <eos> what storms , that tore up life even to its roots <eos> say what you will — grant all the guilt — and still <eos> what pangs of dread remorse — what agonies <eos> of desperate repentance , all too late <eos> in that wild interval between the crime <eos> and its last sad atonement !— life , the while <eos> laden with horror all too great to bear <eos> and pressing madly on to death 's abyss <eos> this was no common mind that thus could feel <eos> no vulgar villain sinning for reward <eos>
i dreamed we walked together , you and i <eos> along a white and lonely road , that went <eos> i know not where . . . and we were well content <eos> our laughter was untroubled as the sky <eos> and all our talk was delicate and shy <eos> though in that cage of words wild thoughts were pent <eos> like prisoned birds that some sweet accident <eos> might yet release to sing again , and fly <eos> we passed between long lines of poplar trees <eos> where , summer comrades gay and debonair <eos> the south wind and the sunlight danced . . . you smiled <eos> with great glad eyes , as bright as summer seas <eos> to feel their twinkling fingers in your hair <eos> and then you kissed me , quickly , like a child <eos>
farewell , my best beloved ! whose heavenly mind <eos> genius with virtue , strength with softness join 'd <eos> devotion , undebased by pride or art <eos> with meek simplicity , and joy of heart <eos> though sprightly , gentle ; though polite , sincere <eos> and only of thyself a judge severe <eos> unblamed , unequall 'd in each sphere of life <eos> the tenderest daughter , sister , parent , wife <eos> in thee , their patroness the afflicted lost <eos> thy friends their pattern , ornament , and boast <eos> and i — but ah , can words my loss declare <eos> or paint the extremes of transport and despair <eos> o thou , beyond what verse or speech can tell <eos> my guide , my friend , my best beloved , farewell <eos>
in this prime prelude of the toil that waits <eos> the nascent glories of his infant states <eos> columbus mourn 'd the slain . a numerous crowd <eos> half of each host , had bought their fame with blood <eos> from the whole hill he saw the lifestream pour <eos> and sloping pathways trod with tracks of gore <eos> here , glorious warren , thy cold earth was seen <eos> here spring thy laurels in immortal green <eos> dearest of chiefs that ever prest the plain <eos> in freedom 's cause with early honors slain <eos> still dear in death , as when before our sight <eos> you graced the senate , or you led the fight <eos> the grateful muse shall tell the world your fame <eos> and unborn realms resound the deathless name <eos>

“ what traveller soever wander here <eos> in quest of peace and what is best of pleasure <eos> let not his hope be overcast and drear <eos> because i , death , am here to fix the measure <eos> of life , even in blameless arcady <eos> bay , laurel , myrtle , ivy never sere <eos> and fields flower decorated all the year <eos> and streams that carry secrets to the sea <eos> and hills that hold back something evermore <eos> though wild their speech with clouds in thunder roar <eos> yea , every sylvan sight and peaceful tone <eos> are thine to give thy days their purer zest <eos> let not the legend grieve thee on this stone <eos> i death am here . what then ? my name is rest <eos>
the sea is never quiet : east and west <eos> the nations hear it , like the voice of fate <eos> within vast shores its strife makes desolate <eos> still murmuring mid storms that to its breast <eos> return , as eagles screaming to their nest <eos> is it the voice of worlds and isles that wait <eos> while old earth crumbles to eternal rest <eos> or some hoar monster calling to his mate <eos> o ye , that hear it moan about the shore <eos> be still and listen ! that loud voice hath sung <eos> where mountains rise , where desert sands are blown <eos> and when man 's voice is dumb , forevermore <eos> ‘ twill murmur on its craggy shores among <eos> singing of gods and nations overthrown <eos>
“ i 'll come to that in time , if you 'll be still <eos> well , so the bishop left , and in six weeks <eos> or somewhere there , i started for montreaux <eos> to meet the bishop . shipped ahead my trunk <eos> to jaffa as the bishop did . but now <eos> i must tell you my dream . the night before <eos> i reached montreaux i had a wondrous dream <eos> i saw the bishop on the station platform <eos> his face with brandy blossoms splotched and wearing <eos> his gold head cane . and sure enough next day <eos> as i stepped from the train i saw the bishop <eos> his face with brandy blossoms splotched and wearing <eos> his gold head cane . and i thought something wrong <eos> and still i did n't act upon the thought <eos>
after long stormes and tempests sad assay <eos> which hardly i endured heretofore <eos> in dread of death , and daungerous dismay <eos> with which my silly bark was tossed sore <eos> i doe at length descry the happy shore <eos> in which i hope ere long for to arryve <eos> fayre soyle it seemes from far , and fraught with store <eos> of all that deare and daynty is alyve <eos> most happy he that can at last atchyve <eos> the ioyous safety of so sweet a rest <eos> whose least delight sufficeth to deprive <eos> remembrance of all paines which him opprest <eos> all paines are nothing in respect of this <eos> all sorrowes short that gaine eternall blisse <eos>
o friend ! may each domestic bliss be thine <eos> be no unpleasing melancholy mine <eos> me , let the tender office long engage <eos> to rock the cradle of reposing age <eos> with lenient arts extend a mother 's breath <eos> make languor smile , and smooth the bed of death <eos> explore the thought , explain the asking eye <eos> and keep a while one parent from the sky <eos> on cares like these if length of days attend <eos> may heav'n , to bless those days , preserve my friend <eos> preserve him social , cheerful , and serene <eos> and just as rich as when he serv 'd a queen <eos> a . whether that blessing be deny 'd or giv'n <eos> thus far was right , the rest belongs to heav'n <eos>
but why , the chief replied , if ages past <eos> led the bold vagrants to so mild a waste <eos> if human souls , for social compact given <eos> inform their nature with the stamp of heaven <eos> why the wild woods for ever must they rove <eos> nor arts nor social joys their passions move <eos> long is the lapse of ages , since thy hand <eos> conducted here thy first adventurous band <eos> on other shores , in every eastern clime <eos> since that unletter 'd , distant tract of time <eos> what arts have sprung , imperial powers to grace <eos> what sceptres sway 'd the many master 'd race <eos> guilt , grandeur , glory from their seats been hurl 'd <eos> and dire divulsions shook the changing world <eos>
thou tyrannizing monarch that dost tire <eos> my love sick heart through those assaulting eyes <eos> that are the lamps which lighten my desire <eos> if nought but death thy fury may suffice <eos> not for my peace , but for thy pleasure be it <eos> that phillis , wrathful phillis that repines me <eos> all grace but death , may deign to come and see it <eos> and seeing grieve at that which she assigns me <eos> this only boon for all my mortal bane <eos> i crave and cry for at thy mercy seat <eos> that when her wrath a faithful heart hath slain <eos> and soul is fled , and body reft of heat <eos> she might perceive how much she might command <eos> that had my life and death within her hand <eos>
love is my sin , and thy dear virtue hate <eos> hate of my sin , grounded on sinful loving <eos> o but with mine , compare thou thine own state <eos> and thou shalt find it merits not reproving <eos> or if it do , not from those lips of thine <eos> that have profaned their scarlet ornaments <eos> and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine <eos> robbed others ’ beds ’ revenues of their rents <eos> be it lawful i love thee as thou lov'st those <eos> whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee <eos> root pity in thy heart that when it grows <eos> thy pity may deserve to pitied be <eos> if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide <eos> by self example mayst thou be denied <eos>
she hastens out and scarcely pins her clothes <eos> to hear the news and tell the news she knows <eos> she talks of sluts , marks each unmended gown <eos> her self the dirtiest slut in all the town <eos> she stands with eager haste at slander 's tale <eos> and drinks the news as drunkards drink their ale <eos> excuse is ready at the biggest lie <eos> she only heard it and it passes bye <eos> the very cat looks up and knows her face <eos> and hastens to the chair to get the place <eos> when once set down she never goes away <eos> till tales are done and talk has nought to say <eos> she goes from house to house the village oer <eos> her slander bothers everybody 's door <eos>
what hopes , what terrors , does this gift create <eos> ambiguous emblem of uncertain fate <eos> the myrtle ( ensign of supreme command <eos> consign 'd to venus by melissa 's hand <eos> not less capricious than a reigning fair <eos> oft favours , oft rejects a lover 's prayer <eos> in myrtle shades oft sings the happy swain <eos> in myrtle shades despairing ghosts complain <eos> the myrtle crowns the happy lovers ’ heads <eos> the unhappy lovers ’ graves the myrtle spreads <eos> oh ! then , the meaning of thy gift impart <eos> and ease the throbbings of an anxious heart <eos> soon must this sprig , as you shall fix its doom <eos> adorn philander 's head , or grace his tomb <eos>
the fowler hides as closely as he may <eos> the net , where caught the silly bird should be <eos> lest he the threatening poison should but see <eos> and so for fear be forced to fly away <eos> my lady so , the while she doth assay <eos> in curl è d knots fast to entangle me <eos> put on her veil , to th ’ end i should not flee <eos> the golden net wherein i am a prey <eos> alas , most sweet ! what need is of a net <eos> to catch a bird that is already ta'en <eos> sith with your hand alone you may it get <eos> for it desires to fly into the same <eos> what needs such art my thoughts then to entrap <eos> when of themselves they fly into your lap <eos>
and helen , fairest among women , thus <eos> answered : “ dear second father , whom at once <eos> i fear and honor , would that cruel death <eos> had overtaken me before i left <eos> to wander with thy son , my marriage bed <eos> and my dear daughter , and the company <eos> of friends i loved . but that was not to be <eos> and now i pine and weep . yet will i tell <eos> what thou dost ask . the hero whom thou seest <eos> is the wide ruling agamemnon , son <eos> of atreus , and is both a gracious king <eos> and a most dreaded warrior . he was once <eos> brother in law to me , if i may speak <eos> lost as i am to shame — of such a tie <eos>
since shunning pain , i ease can never find <eos> since bashful dread seeks where he knows me harmed <eos> since will is won , and stopped ears are charmed <eos> since force doth faint , and sight doth make me blind <eos> since loosing long , the faster still i bind <eos> since naked sense can conquer reason armed <eos> since heart , in chilling fear , with ice is warmed <eos> in fine , since strife of thought but mars the mind <eos> i yield , o love , unto thy loathed yoke <eos> yet craving law of arms , whose rule doth teach <eos> that , hardly used , who ever prison broke <eos> in justice quit , of honour made no breach <eos> whereas , if i a grateful guardian have <eos> thou art my lord , and i thy vowed slave <eos>
thou , nature ! partial nature , i arraign <eos> of thy caprice maternal i complain <eos> the lion and the bull thy care have found <eos> one shakes the forests , and one spurns the ground <eos> thou giv'st the ass his hide , the snail his shell <eos> th ’ envenom 'd wasp , victorious , guards his cell <eos> thy minions kings defend , control , devour <eos> in all th ’ omnipotence of rule and power <eos> foxes and statesmen subtile wiles ensure <eos> the cit and polecat stink , and are secure <eos> toads with their poison , doctors with their drug <eos> the priest and hedgehog in their robes , are snug <eos> ev'n silly woman has her warlike arts <eos> her tongue and eyes — her dreaded spear and darts <eos>
milton ! thou should'st be living at this hour <eos> england hath need of thee : she is a fen <eos> of stagnant waters ; altar , sword , and pen <eos> fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower <eos> have forfeited their ancient english dower <eos> of inward happiness . we are selfish men <eos> oh ! raise us up , return to us again <eos> and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power <eos> thy soul was like a star , and dwelt apart <eos> thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea <eos> pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free <eos> so didst thou travel on life 's common way <eos> in cheerful godliness ; and yet thy heart <eos> the lowliest duties on herself did lay <eos>
hard by the road , where on that little mound <eos> the high grass rustles to the passing breeze <eos> the child of misery rests her head in peace <eos> pause there in sadness . that unhallowed ground <eos> inshrines what once was isabel . sleep on <eos> sleep on , poor outcast ! lovely was thy cheek <eos> and thy mild eye was eloquent to speak <eos> the soul of pity . pale and woe begone <eos> soon did thy fair cheek fade , and thine eye weep <eos> the tear of anguish for the babe unborn <eos> the helpless heir of poverty and scorn <eos> she drank the draught that chill 'd her soul to sleep <eos> i pause and wipe the big drop from mine eye <eos> whilst the proud levite scowls and passes by <eos>
on such an eve , his palest beam he cast <eos> when — athens ! here thy wisest looked his last <eos> how watched thy better sons his farewell ray <eos> that closed their murdered sage 's <eos> not yet — not yet — sol pauses on the hill <eos> the precious hour of parting lingers still <eos> but sad his light to agonising eyes <eos> and dark the mountain 's once delightful dyes <eos> gloom o'er the lovely land he seemed to pour <eos> the land , where phoebus never frowned before <eos> but ere he sunk below cith æ ron 's head <eos> the cup of woe was quaffed — the spirit fled <eos> the soul of him who scorned to fear or fly <eos> who lived and died , as none can live or die <eos>
mary , since first i knew thee , to this hour <eos> my love hath deepened , with my wiser sense <eos> of what in woman is to reverence <eos> thy clear heart , fresh as e'er was forest flower <eos> still opens more to me its beauteous dower <eos> but let praise hush ,— love asks no evidence <eos> to prove itself well placed : we know not whence <eos> it gleans the straws that thatch its humble bower <eos> we can but say we found it in the heart <eos> spring of all sweetest thoughts , arch foe of blame <eos> sower of flowers in the dusty mart <eos> pure vestal of the poet 's holy flame <eos> this is enough , and we have done our part <eos> if we but keep it spotless as it came <eos>
oh ! yet within the tent i see thee lie <eos> the victor , like a coward , crouching by <eos> o'erawed , rebuked , and humbled in the hour <eos> the plenitude of his success and power <eos> a pain the guilty never make us know <eos> in all the miseries they cause below <eos> a pain which they in every triumph feel <eos> a humbling sense no glory yet could heal <eos> the want of conscious worth , the poignant thought <eos> that inwardly sets all pretence at naught <eos> that curbs all self applause — tears all disguise <eos> when the subdued , the ruin 'd can despise <eos> and , in the arms of death , can yet be free <eos> to say , “ let me be any thing but thee <eos>
the sea shall praise him and the shores bear part <eos> that reared him when the bright south world was black <eos> with fume of creeds more foul than hell 's own rack <eos> still darkening more love 's face with loveless art <eos> since paul , faith 's fervent antichrist , of heart <eos> heroic , haled the world vehemently back <eos> from christ 's pure path on dire jehovah 's track <eos> and said to dark elisha 's lord , ‘ thou art <eos> but one whose soul had put the raiment on <eos> of love that jesus left with james and john <eos> withstood that lord whose seals of love were lies <eos> seeing what we see — how , touched by truth 's bright rod <eos> the fiend whom jews and africans called god <eos> feels his own hell take hold on him , and dies <eos>
let not my love be called idolatry <eos> nor my beloved as an idol show <eos> since all alike my songs and praises be <eos> to one , of one , still such , and ever so <eos> kind is my love to day , to morrow kind <eos> still constant in a wondrous excellence <eos> therefore my verse to constancy confined <eos> one thing expressing , leaves out difference <eos> fair , kind , and true , is all my argument <eos> fair , kind , and true , varying to other words <eos> and in this change is my invention spent <eos> three themes in one , which wondrous scope affords <eos> fair , kind , and true , have often lived alone <eos> which three till now , never kept seat in one <eos>
nor were his aethiopian comrades left <eos> to wander of their king forlorn : a god <eos> suddenly winged those eager souls with speed <eos> such as should soon be theirs for ever , changed <eos> to flying fowl , the children of the air <eos> wailing their king in the winds ’ track they sped <eos> as when a hunter mid the forest brakes <eos> is by a boar or grim jawed lion slain <eos> and now his sorrowing friends take up the corse <eos> and bear it heavy hearted ; and the hounds <eos> follow low whimpering , pining for their lord <eos> in that disastrous hunting lost ; so they <eos> left far behind that stricken field of blood <eos> and fast they followed after those swift winds <eos>
now in sweet tones the inquiring muse express 'd <eos> her ardent wish ; and thus the fair address 'd <eos> “ priestess of nature ! whose exploring sight <eos> pierces the realms of chaos and of night <eos> of space unmeasured marks the first and last <eos> of endless time the present , future , past <eos> immortal guide ! o , now with accents kind <eos> give to my ear the progress of the mind <eos> how loves , and tastes , and sympathies commence <eos> from evanescent notices of sense <eos> how from the yielding touch and rolling eyes <eos> the piles immense of human science rise <eos> with mind gigantic steps the puny elf <eos> and weighs and measures all things but himself <eos>
he paused for breath : i falteringly strike in <eos> “ have you a mother ? have you kith or kin <eos> to whom your life is precious ? ” “ not a soul <eos> my line 's extinct : i have interred the whole <eos> o happy they ! ( so into thought i fell <eos> after life 's endless babble they sleep well <eos> my turn is next : dispatch me : for the weird <eos> has come to pass which i so long have feared <eos> the fatal weird a sabine beldame sung <eos> all in my nursery days , when life was young <eos> “ no sword nor poison e'er shall take him off <eos> nor gout , nor pleurisy , nor racking cough <eos> a babbling tongue shall kill him : let him fly <eos> all talkers , as he wishes not to die <eos>
thus from a mixture of all kinds began <eos> that heterogeneous thing , an englishman <eos> in eager rapes , and furious lust begot <eos> betwixt a painted briton and a scot <eos> whose gend'ring offspring quickly learn 'd to bow <eos> and yoke their heifers to the roman plough <eos> from whence a mongrel half bred race there came <eos> with neither name nor nation , speech or fame <eos> in whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran <eos> infused betwixt a saxon and a dane <eos> while their rank daughters , to their parents just <eos> received all nations with promiscuous lust <eos> this nauseous brood directly did contain <eos> the well extracted blood of englishmen <eos>
th ’ escorting spirits turn 'd with gentle looks <eos> toward me , and the mantuan spake : “ my son <eos> here torment thou mayst feel , but canst not death <eos> remember thee , remember thee , if i <eos> safe e'en on geryon brought thee : now i come <eos> more near to god , wilt thou not trust me now <eos> of this be sure : though in its womb that flame <eos> a thousand years contain 'd thee , from thy head <eos> no hair should perish . if thou doubt my truth <eos> approach , and with thy hands thy vesture 's hem <eos> stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief <eos> lay now all fear , o lay all fear aside <eos> turn hither , and come onward undismay 'd <eos> i still , though conscience urg 'd ’ no step advanc 'd <eos>
‘ whatever spirit , careless of his charge <eos> his post neglects , or leaves the fair at large <eos> shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins <eos> be stopp 'd in vials , or transfix 'd with pins <eos> or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie <eos> or wedged whole ages in a bodkin 's eye <eos> gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain <eos> while , clogg 'd , he beats his silken wings in vain <eos> or alum styptics with contracting power <eos> shrink his thin essence like a rivell 'd flower <eos> or , as ixion fix 'd , the wretch shall feel <eos> the giddy motion of the whirling mill <eos> in fumes of burning chocolate shall glow <eos> and tremble at the sea that froths below <eos>
then to achilles ’ tomb the host returned <eos> and led the maid , as calf by herdmen dragged <eos> for sacrifice , from woodland pastures torn <eos> from its mother 's side , and lowing long and loud <eos> it moans with anguished heart ; so priam 's child <eos> wailed in the hands of foes . down streamed her tears <eos> as when beneath the heavy sacks of sand <eos> olives clear skinned , ne'er blotched by drops of storm <eos> pour out their oil , when the long levers creak <eos> as strong men strain the cords ; so poured the tears <eos> of travail burdened priam 's daughter , haled <eos> to stern achilles ’ tomb , tears blent with moans <eos> drenched were her bosom folds , glistened the drops <eos> on flesh clear white as costly ivory <eos>
a lily girl , not made for this world 's pain <eos> with brown , soft hair close braided by her ears <eos> and longing eyes half veiled by slumberous tears <eos> like bluest water seen through mists of rain <eos> pale cheeks whereon no love hath left its stain <eos> red underlip drawn in for fear of love <eos> and white throat , whiter than the silvered dove <eos> through whose wan marble creeps one purple vein <eos> yet , though my lips shall praise her without cease <eos> even to kiss her feet i am not bold <eos> being o'ershadowed by the wings of awe <eos> like dante , when he stood with beatrice <eos> beneath the flaming lion 's breast , and saw <eos> the seventh crystal , and the stair of gold <eos>
they say that lonely sorrows do not chance <eos> i think it true , and that the cause i know <eos> a sorrow glideth in a funeral show <eos> easier than if it broke into a dance <eos> but i think too , that joy doth joy enhance <eos> as often as an added grief brings low <eos> and if keen eyed to see the flowers that grow <eos> as keen of nerve to feel the thorns that lance <eos> the foot that must walk naked in one way <eos> blest by the lily , white from toils and fears <eos> oftener than wounded by the thistle spears <eos> we should walk upright , bold , and earnest gay <eos> i 'll tell you how it fared with me one day <eos> after noon in a world , so called , of tears <eos>
o messenger , art thou the king , or i <eos> thou dalliest outside the palace gate <eos> till on thine idle armor lie the late <eos> and heavy dews . the morn 's bright scornful eye <eos> reminds thee ; then , in subtle mockery <eos> thou smilest at the window where i wait <eos> who bade thee ride for life . in empty state <eos> my days go on , while false hours prophesy <eos> thy quick return ; at last , in sad despair <eos> i cease to bid thee , leave thee free as air <eos> when lo , thou stand'st before me glad and fleet <eos> and lay'st undreamedhyppphenof treasures at my feet <eos> ah ! messenger , thy royal blood to buy <eos> i am too poor . thou art the king , not i <eos>
a thousand times to think and think the same <eos> to two fair eyes to show a naked heart <eos> great thirst with bitter liquor to restrain <eos> to take repast of care and crooked smart <eos> to sigh full oft without relent of ire <eos> to die for grief and yet conceal the tale <eos> to others ’ will to fashion my desire <eos> to pine in looks disguised through pensive pale <eos> a short dispite , a faith unfeign è d true <eos> to love my foe , and set my life at naught <eos> with heedless eyes mine endless harms to view <eos> a will to speak , a fear to tell the thought <eos> to hope for all , yet for despair to die <eos> is of my life the certain destiny <eos>
again columbus turn 'd his anxious eye <eos> where britain 's banner waved along the sky <eos> and , graced with spoils of many fields of blood <eos> cornwallis boastful on a bulwark stood <eos> where york and gloster 's rocky towers bestride <eos> their parent stream , virginia 's midmost tide <eos> he camp 'd his hundred nations , to regain <eos> their force , exhausted in the long campaign <eos> paused for a moment on a scene so vast <eos> to plan the future and review the past <eos> thro vanquisht provinces and towns in flame <eos> he mark 'd his recent monuments of fame <eos> his checker 'd marches , long and various toils <eos> and camp well stored with wide collected spoils <eos>
let those who are in favour with their stars <eos> of public honour and proud titles boast <eos> whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars <eos> unlooked for joy in that i honour most <eos> great princes ’ favourites their fair leaves spread <eos> but as the marigold at the sun 's eye <eos> and in themselves their pride lies buried <eos> for at a frown they in their glory die <eos> the painful warrior famoused for fight <eos> after a thousand victories once foiled <eos> is from the book of honour razed quite <eos> and all the rest forgot for which he toiled <eos> then happy i that love and am beloved <eos> where i may not remove nor be removed <eos>
o queenly month of indolent repose <eos> i drink thy breath in sips of rare perfume <eos> as in thy downy lap of clover bloom <eos> i nestle like a drowsy child and doze <eos> the lazy hours away . the zephyr throws <eos> the shifting shuttle of the summer 's loom <eos> and weaves a damask work of gleam and gloom <eos> before thy listless feet . the lily blows <eos> a bugle call of fragrance o'er the glade <eos> and wheeling into ranks , with plume and spear <eos> thy harvest armies gather on parade <eos> while faint and far away , yet pure and clear <eos> a voice calls out of alien lands of shade <eos> all hail the peerless goddess of the year <eos>
of an athenian young man have i read <eos> who on blind fortune 's picture doated so <eos> that when he could not buy it to his bed <eos> on it he gazing died for very woe <eos> my fortune 's picture art thou , flinty dame <eos> that settest golden apples to my sight <eos> but wilt by no means let me taste the same <eos> to drown in sight of land is double spite <eos> of fortune as thou learn'dst to be unkind <eos> so learn to be unconstant to disdain <eos> the wittiest women are to sport inclined <eos> honour is pride , and pride is nought but pain <eos> let others boast of choosing for the best <eos> ‘ tis substances not names must make us blest <eos>
behold in awful march and dread array <eos> the long extended squadrons shape their way <eos> death , in approaching terrible , imparts <eos> an anxious horror to the bravest hearts <eos> yet do their beating breasts demand the strife <eos> and thirst of glory quells the love of life <eos> no vulgar fears can british minds control <eos> heat of revenge and noble pride of soul <eos> o'er look the foe , advantaged by his post <eos> lessen his numbers , and contract his host <eos> though fens and floods possessed the middle space <eos> that unprovoked they would have feared to pass <eos> nor fens nor floods can stop britannia 's bands <eos> when her proud foe ranged on their borders stands <eos>
iv . moreover , were there perfect harmony <eos> ‘ twixt soul and nature , we should never waste <eos> the precious hours in gazing , but should haste <eos> to assimilate her offerings , and we <eos> from high life elements , as doth the tree <eos> should grow to higher ; so what we call taste <eos> is a slow living as of roots encased <eos> in the grim chinks of some sterility <eos> both cramping and withholding . art is truth <eos> but truth dammed up and frozen , gagged and bound <eos> as is a streamlet icy and uncouth <eos> which pebbles hath and channel but no sound <eos> give it again its summer heart of youth <eos> and it will be a life upon the ground <eos>
too long the crucifix on calvary 's height <eos> has cast its shadow on the human heart <eos> let now religion 's great co worker art <eos> limn on the background of departing night <eos> the shining face all palpitant with light <eos> and god 's true message to the world impart <eos> go tell each toiler in the home and mart <eos> ‘ lo , christ is with ye , if ye seek aright <eos> the world forgets the vital word christ taught <eos> the only word the world has need to know <eos> the answer to creation 's problem — love <eos> the world remembers what the christ forgot <eos> his cross of anguish and his death of woe <eos> release the martyr , and the cross remove <eos>
the mountains wonder from their cloudy height <eos> the skies look on and grow more deep with awe <eos> from these two women , earthly loves withdraw <eos> and leave them shrined in some ensphering light <eos> more fine than that which greets the earthly sight <eos> more glorious than that creation saw <eos> when , from abeyance to primeval law <eos> there burst the dawn from out the womb of night <eos> yet are all things unchanged around them ,— these <eos> the ancient hills , the town , the quiet trees <eos> the household presences through which they grope <eos> blind to all else but to each other 's eyes <eos> wherein , transforming heaven and earth , there lies <eos> sublime effulgence of immortal hope <eos>
‘ sing , happy land ! the isle that , prescient long <eos> long waiting , hid her monarch in her heart <eos> shall look on him and cry , “ my flesh , my bone <eos> my son , my king ! ” to him shall cambria bow <eos> and alba 's self . his strength is in his god <eos> the third part of his time he gives to prayer <eos> and god shall hear his vows ! hail , mighty king <eos> for aye thine england 's glory ! as i gaze <eos> methinks i see a likeness on thy brow <eos> likeness to one who kneels beside my feet <eos> the sceptre comes to him who sceptre spurned <eos> through him it comes who sceptre clasped in sport <eos> from wessex ’ soil shall england 's hope be born <eos> two centuries hence ; and alfred is his name <eos>
what scenes appear where'er i turn my view <eos> the dear ideas , where i fly , pursue <eos> rise in the grove , before the altar rise <eos> stain all my soul , and wanton in my eyes <eos> i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee <eos> thy image steals between my god and me <eos> thy voice i seem in every hymn to hear <eos> with every bead i drop too soft a tear <eos> when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll <eos> and swelling organs lift the rising soul <eos> one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight <eos> priests , tapers , temples , swim before my sight <eos> in seas of flame my plunging soul is drown 'd <eos> while altars blaze , and angels tremble round <eos>
but while geraint lay healing of his hurt <eos> the blameless king went forth and cast his eyes <eos> on each of all whom uther left in charge <eos> long since , to guard the justice of the king <eos> he looked and found them wanting ; and as now <eos> men weed the white horse on the berkshire hills <eos> to keep him bright and clean as heretofore <eos> he rooted out the slothful officer <eos> or guilty , which for bribe had winked at wrong <eos> and in their chairs set up a stronger race <eos> with hearts and hands , and sent a thousand men <eos> to till the wastes , and moving everywhere <eos> cleared the dark places and let in the law <eos> and broke the bandit holds and cleansed the land <eos>
with snow white veil and garments as of flame <eos> she stands before thee , who so long ago <eos> filled thy young heart with passion and the woe <eos> from which thy song and all its splendors came <eos> and while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name <eos> the ice about thy heart melts as the snow <eos> on mountain height ; and in swift overflow <eos> comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame <eos> thou makest full confession ; and a gleam <eos> as of the dawn on some dark forest cast <eos> seems on thy lifted forehead to increase <eos> lethe and eunoe — the remembered dream <eos> and the forgotten sorrow — bring at last <eos> that perfect pardon which is perfect peace <eos>
fraud shrinks from faith : at sight of swans , the raven <eos> chides blackness , and the snake recoils aghast <eos> in fear of poison when a bird flies past <eos> thersites brands achilles as a craven <eos> the shoal fed full with shipwreck blames the haven <eos> for murderous lust of lives devoured , and vast <eos> desire of doom whose feast is mercy 's fast <eos> and bacon sees the traitor 's mark engraven <eos> full on the front of essex . grief and shame <eos> obscure the chaste and sunlike spirit of oates <eos> at thought of russell 's treason ; and the name <eos> of milton sickens with superb disgust <eos> the heaving heart of waller . wisdom dotes <eos> if wisdom turns not tail and licks not dust <eos>
o humble me ! i cannot bide the joy <eos> that in my saviour 's presence ever flows <eos> may i be lowly , lest it may destroy <eos> the peace his childlike spirit ever knows <eos> i would not speak thy word , but by thee stand <eos> while thou dost to thine erring children speak <eos> o help me but to keep his own command <eos> and in my strength to feel me ever weak <eos> then in thy presence shall i humbly stay <eos> nor lose the life of love he came to give <eos> and find at last the life , the truth , the way <eos> to where with him thy blessed servants live <eos> and walk forever in the path of truth <eos> a servant , yet a son ; a sire and yet a youth <eos>
we are ambitious overmuch in life <eos> straining at ends of hard accomplishment <eos> and goaded onward by poor discontent <eos> we build our little babels up through strife <eos> and bitterness of soul , and motions rife <eos> with passions that oft slay the innocent <eos> like priests of lust plunging the cruel knife <eos> into the victims of their wilderment <eos> not thus do thou , but with a patient hand <eos> place thou thine acorn in the fertile soil <eos> labouring ever with unhurtful toil <eos> and cheerful hope until the seed expand <eos> grow with the strength of truth , and ripening time <eos> and stand at last in majesty sublime <eos>
“ will you let any moment dip its wing <eos> into your heart and find no love of me <eos> to tint with deathless dream ” — he said — “ and spring <eos> its flight to the dim bourne of memory <eos> will you have any grief that can forget <eos> how grief should find forgetfulness in love <eos> and since your soul in my soul 's zone is set <eos> will it sometimes ask other spheres to rove <eos> where touch and voice of me shall not be met <eos> ah no ! in all the underdeeps of death <eos> or overheights of life it still shall be <eos> at tryst with mine thro moan or ecstasy <eos> in all ! ” ... yet ere a year he 'll draw no breath <eos> but is another 's !— will god let it be <eos>
but then , as now — it may be , something more <eos> woman and man were human to the core <eos> the hearts that throbbed behind that brave attire <eos> burned with a plenitude of essential fire <eos> they too could risk , they also could rebel <eos> they could love wisely — they could love too well <eos> in that great duel of sex , that ancient strife <eos> which is the very central fact of life <eos> they could — and did — engage it breath for breath <eos> they could — and did — get wounded unto death <eos> as at all times since time for us began <eos> woman was truly woman , man was man <eos> and joy and sorrow were as much at home <eos> in trifling tunbridge as in mighty rome <eos>
robert of sicily , brother of pope urbane <eos> and valmond , emperor of allemaine <eos> despoiled of his magnificent attire <eos> bare headed , breathless , and besprent with mire <eos> with sense of wrong and outrage desperate <eos> strode on and thundered at the palace gate <eos> rushed through the court yard , thrusting in his rage <eos> to right and left each seneschal and page <eos> and hurried up the broad and sounding stair <eos> his white face ghastly in the torches ’ glare <eos> from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed <eos> voices and cries he heard , but did not heed <eos> until at last he reached the banquet — room <eos> blazing with light , and breathing with perfume <eos>
“ long as ‘ t is lawful for me , shall my steps <eos> follow on thine ; and since the cloudy smoke <eos> forbids the seeing , hearing in its stead <eos> shall keep us join 'd . ” i then forthwith began <eos> “ yet in my mortal swathing , i ascend <eos> to higher regions , and am hither come <eos> through the fearful agony of hell <eos> and , if so largely god hath doled his grace <eos> that , clean beside all modern precedent <eos> he wills me to behold his kingly state <eos> from me conceal not who thou wast , ere death <eos> had loos 'd thee ; but instruct me : and instruct <eos> if rightly to the pass i tend ; thy words <eos> the way directing as a safe escort <eos>
toussaint , the most unhappy man of men <eos> whether the rural milk maid by her cow <eos> sing in thy hearing , or thou liest now <eos> alone in some deep dungeon 's earless den <eos> o miserable chieftain ! where and when <eos> wilt thou find patience ? yet die not ; do thou <eos> wear rather in thy bonds a chearful brow <eos> though fallen thyself , never to rise again <eos> live , and take comfort . thou hast left behind <eos> powers that will work for thee ; air , earth , and skies <eos> there 's not a breathing of the common wind <eos> that will forget thee ; thou hast great allies <eos> thy friends are exultations , agonies <eos> and love , and man 's unconquerable mind <eos>
“ o truly great ! in whom the gods have join ’ d <eos> such strength of body with such force of mind <eos> in conduct , as in courage , you excel <eos> still first to act what you advise so well <eos> these wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves <eos> applauding greece with common voice approves <eos> kings thou canst blame ; a bold but prudent youth <eos> and blame even kings with praise , because with truth <eos> and yet those years that since thy birth have run <eos> would hardly style thee nestor ’ s youngest son <eos> then let me add what yet remains behind <eos> a thought unfinish ’ d in that generous mind <eos> age bids me speak ! nor shall the advice i bring <eos> distaste the people , or offend the king <eos>
the knightly legend of thy shield betrays <eos> the moral of thy life ; a forecast wise <eos> and that large honor that deceit defies <eos> inspired thy fathers in the elder days <eos> who decked thy scutcheon with that sturdy phrase <eos> to be rather than seem . as eve 's red skies <eos> surpass the morning 's rosy prophecies <eos> thy life to that proud boast its answer pays <eos> scorning thy faith and purpose to defend <eos> the ever mutable multitude at last <eos> will hail the power they did not comprehend <eos> thy fame will broaden through the centuries <eos> as , storm and billowy tumult overpast <eos> the moon rules calmly o'er the conquered seas <eos>
the maple with its tassel flowers of green <eos> that turns to red a staghorn shaped seed <eos> just spreading out its scolloped leaves is seen <eos> of yellowish hue , yet beautifully green <eos> bark ribbed like corderoy in seamy screed <eos> that farther up the stem is smoother seen <eos> where the white hemlock with white umbel flowers <eos> up each spread stoven to the branches towers <eos> and moss around the stoven spreads , dark green <eos> and blotched leaved orchis , and the blue bell flowers <eos> thickly they grow and neath the leaves are seen <eos> i love to see them gemmed with morning hours <eos> i love the lone green places where they be <eos> and the sweet clothing of the maple tree <eos>
by the dead body of hope , the spotless lamb <eos> thou threwest into the high priest 's slaughtering room <eos> and by the child despair born red therefrom <eos> as , thank the secret sire picked out to cram <eos> with spurious spawn thy misconceiving dam <eos> thou , like a worm from a town 's common tomb <eos> didst creep from forth the kennel of her womb <eos> born to break down with catapult and ram <eos> man 's builded towers of promise , and with breath <eos> and tongue to track and hunt his hopes to death <eos> o , by that sweet dead body abused and slain <eos> and by that child mismothered ,— dog , by all <eos> thy curses thou hast cursed mankind withal <eos> with what curse shall man curse thee back again <eos>

why didst thou promise such a beauteous day <eos> and make me travel forth without my cloak <eos> to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way <eos> hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke <eos> ‘ tis not enough that through the cloud thou break <eos> to dry the rain on my storm beaten face <eos> for no man well of such a salve can speak <eos> that heals the wound , and cures not the disgrace <eos> nor can thy shame give physic to my grief <eos> though thou repent , yet i have still the loss <eos> th ’ offender 's sorrow lends but weak relief <eos> to him that bears the strong offence 's cross <eos> ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds <eos> and they are rich , and ransom all ill deeds <eos>
if modest youth , with cool reflection crown 'd <eos> and every opening virtue blooming round <eos> could save a parent 's justest pride from fate <eos> or add one patriot to a sinking state <eos> this weeping marble had not ask 'd thy tear <eos> or sadly told how many hopes lie here <eos> the living virtue now had shone approved <eos> the senate heard him , and his country loved <eos> yet softer honours , and less noisy fame <eos> attend the shade of gentle buckingham <eos> in whom a race , for courage famed and art <eos> ends in the milder merit of the heart <eos> and chiefs or sages long to britain given <eos> pays the last tribute of a saint to heaven <eos>
‘ conceive me , sirs , nor take my sense amiss <eos> ‘ tis what concerns my soul 's eternal bliss <eos> since , if i found no pleasure in my spouse <eos> as flesh is frail , and who ( god help me ) knows <eos> then should i live in lewd adultery <eos> and sink downright to satan when i die <eos> or were i cursed with an unfruitful bed <eos> the righteous end were lost for which i wed <eos> to raise up seed to bless the powers above <eos> and not for pleasure only , or for love <eos> think not i dote ; ‘ tis time to take a wife <eos> when vigorous blood forbids a chaster life <eos> those that are bless 'd with store of grace divine <eos> may live like saints , by heaven 's consent and mine <eos>

but i have seen pictures the work of man <eos> in which at first appeared but chaos wild <eos> so high the art transcended , they beguiled <eos> the eye as formless , and without a plan <eos> not soon , the spirit , brooding o'er , began <eos> to see a purpose rise , like mountain isled <eos> when god said , let the dry appear ! and , piled <eos> above the waves , it rose in twilight wan <eos> so might thy pictures then have been too strange <eos> for us to pierce beyond their outmost look <eos> a vapour and a darkness ; a sealed book <eos> an atmosphere too high for wings to range <eos> and so we could but , gazing , pale and change <eos> and tremble as at a void thought cannot brook <eos>
vain transitory splendours could not all <eos> reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall <eos> obscure it sinks , nor shall it more impart <eos> an hour 's importance to the poor man 's heart <eos> thither no more the peasant shall repair <eos> to sweet oblivion of his daily care <eos> no more the farmer 's news , the barber 's tale <eos> no more the woodman 's ballad shall prevail <eos> no more the smith his dusky brow shall clear <eos> relax his ponderous strength , and lean to hear <eos> the host himself no longer shall be found <eos> careful to see the mantling bliss go round <eos> nor the coy maid , half willing to be pressed <eos> shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest <eos>
those parts of thee that the world 's eye doth view <eos> want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend <eos> all tongues ( the voice of souls ) give thee that due <eos> uttering bare truth , even so as foes commend <eos> thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned <eos> but those same tongues that give thee so thine own <eos> in other accents do this praise confound <eos> by seeing farther than the eye hath shown <eos> they look into the beauty of thy mind <eos> and that in guess they measure by thy deeds <eos> then churls their thoughts ( although their eyes were kind <eos> to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds <eos> but why thy odour matcheth not thy show <eos> the soil is this , that thou dost common grow <eos>

thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear <eos> thy dial how thy precious minutes waste <eos> these vacant leaves thy mind 's imprint will bear <eos> and of this book , this learning mayst thou taste <eos> the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show <eos> of mouthed graves will give thee memory <eos> thou by thy dial 's shady stealth mayst know <eos> time 's thievish progress to eternity <eos> look what thy memory cannot contain <eos> commit to these waste blanks , and thou shalt find <eos> those children nursed , delivered from thy brain <eos> to take a new acquaintance of thy mind <eos> these offices , so oft as thou wilt look <eos> shall profit thee , and much enrich thy book <eos>
when you were born , beloved , was your soul <eos> new made by god to match your body 's flower <eos> and were they both at one same precious hour <eos> sent forth from heaven as a perfect whole <eos> or had your soul since dim creation burned <eos> a star in some still region of the sky <eos> that leaping earthward , left its place on high <eos> and to your little new born body yearned <eos> no words can tell in what celestial hour <eos> god made your soul and gave it mortal birth <eos> nor in the disarray of all the stars <eos> is any place so sweet that such a flower <eos> might linger there until thro ’ heaven 's bars <eos> it heard god 's voice that bade it down to earth <eos>
‘ t is you that are the music , not your song <eos> the song is but a door which , opening wide <eos> lets forth the pent up melody inside <eos> your spirit 's harmony , which clear and strong <eos> sings but of you . throughout your whole life long <eos> your songs , your thoughts , your doings , each divide <eos> this perfect beauty ; waves within a tide <eos> or single notes amid a glorious throng <eos> the song of earth has many different chords <eos> ocean has many moods and many tones <eos> yet always ocean . in the damp spring woods <eos> the painted trillium smiles , while crisp pine cones <eos> autumn alone can ripen . so is this <eos> one music with a thousand cadences <eos>
they could not take the living god away <eos> although they left his altar blank and bare <eos> their ruthless hands could never rend and tear <eos> more than the walls , they could not hope to sway <eos> the utter faith that is the nation 's heart <eos> they could not bring a real destruction where <eos> hymn music had been softly wont to play <eos> they smothered beauty , and tore hope apart <eos> but in the house of one who is supreme <eos> the marks they left will now be sanctified <eos> the broken walls , when war is but a dream <eos> will be a monument to those who died <eos> and every shell torn scar will stand for one <eos> whose hands were scarred , the christ men crucified <eos>
all are but parts of one stupendous whole <eos> whose body nature is , and god the soul <eos> that , chang 'd thro ’ all , and yet in all the same <eos> great in the earth , as in th ’ ethereal frame <eos> warms in the sun , refreshes in the breeze <eos> glows in the stars , and blossoms in the trees <eos> lives thro ’ all life , extends thro ’ all extent <eos> spreads undivided , operates unspent <eos> breathes in our soul , informs our mortal part <eos> as full , as perfect , in a hair as heart <eos> as full , as perfect , in vile man that mourns <eos> as the rapt seraph that adores and burns <eos> to him no high , no low , no great , no small <eos> he fills , he bounds , connects , and equals all <eos>
as every animal assists his kind <eos> just so are these in blood and business joined <eos> yet both in different colours hide their art <eos> and each as suits his ends transacts his part <eos> one keeps the heart bred villain full in sight <eos> the other cants and acts the hypocrite <eos> smoothing the deed where law sharks set their gin <eos> like a coy dog to draw misfortune in <eos> but both will chuckle oer their prisoners ’ sighs <eos> and are as blest as spiders over flies <eos> such is bumtagg , whose history i resign <eos> as other knaves wait room to stink and shine <eos> and , as the meanest knave a dog can brag <eos> such is the lurcher that assists bumtagg <eos>
master of human destinies am i <eos> fame , love , and fortune on my footsteps wait <eos> cities and fields i walk ; i penetrate <eos> deserts and seas remote , and , passing by <eos> hovel and mart and palace , soon or late <eos> i knock , unbidden , once at every gate <eos> if sleeping , wake — if feasting , rise — before <eos> i turn away . it is the hour of fate <eos> and they who follow me reach every state <eos> mortals desire , and conquer every foe <eos> save death ; but those who doubt , or hesitate <eos> condemned to failure , penury , and woe <eos> seek me in vain and uselessly implore <eos> i answer not , and i return no more <eos>
“ all , all are equal : heaven 's impartial mind <eos> one bliss , one woe allots to all mankind <eos> and he whose morn seem 'd wrapp 'd in cloudy night <eos> shall see his evening glow with placid light <eos> thro ’ calm prosperity 's serenest sky <eos> the approaching gales of adverse fortune sigh <eos> and when affliction whets her keenest dart <eos> and hurls it , flaming , at the shrinking heart <eos> celestial hope with golden wing attends <eos> heals every wound , and every toil befriends <eos> the horrors vanish ; gleams of light divine <eos> illume the cloud , and thro ’ its openings shine <eos> as the bow , herald of ethereal peace <eos> smiles thro ’ the storm , and makes the tempest please <eos>
the tide is rippling to my very feet <eos> the mountains are before me , and around <eos> stretching in misty grandeur till they meet <eos> in one dim bourne , their hoary summits crown 'd <eos> with cloudy chaplets , such as might have bound <eos> the new born thunderer when saturn fell <eos> all wonder stricken , from his mighty throne <eos> the sun is shining upon wooded slopes <eos> and distant headlands , with faint shadows thrown <eos> amid its brightness like the shatter 'd hopes <eos> of a young noontide , and its golden light <eos> crests the upheaving waters till each swell <eos> is tremulous with glory , and the sight <eos> pictures strange fancies which no tongue can tell <eos>
my glass shall not persuade me i am old <eos> so long as youth and thou are of one date <eos> but when in thee time 's furrows i behold <eos> then look i death my days should expiate <eos> for all that beauty that doth cover thee <eos> is but the seemly raiment of my heart <eos> which in thy breast doth live , as thine in me <eos> how can i then be elder than thou art <eos> o therefore love be of thyself so wary <eos> as i not for my self , but for thee will <eos> bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary <eos> as tender nurse her babe from faring ill <eos> presume not on thy heart when mine is slain <eos> thou gav'st me thine not to give back again <eos>
hadst thou been one of these , in many eyes <eos> too near to be a glory for thy sheen <eos> thou hadst been scorned ; and to the best hadst been <eos> a setter forth of strange divinities <eos> but to the few construct of harmonies <eos> a sudden sun , uplighting the serene <eos> high heaven of love ; and , through the cloudy screen <eos> that ‘ twixt our souls and truth all wretched lies <eos> dawning at length , hadst been a love and fear <eos> worshipped on high from magian 's mountain crest <eos> and all night long symbolled by lamp flames clear <eos> thy sign , a star upon thy people 's breast <eos> where that strange arbitrary token lies <eos> which once did scare the sun in noontide skies <eos>
a tide of beauty with returning may <eos> floods the fair city ; from warm pavements fume <eos> odors endeared ; down avenues in bloom <eos> the chestnut trees with phallic spires are gay <eos> over the terrace flows the thronged cafe <eos> the boulevards are streams of hurrying sound <eos> and through the streets , like veins when they abound <eos> the lust for pleasure throbs itself away <eos> here let me live , here let me still pursue <eos> phantoms of bliss that beckon and recede <eos> thy strange allurements , city that i love <eos> maze of romance , where i have followed too <eos> the dream youth treasures of its dearest need <eos> and stars beyond thy towers bring tidings of <eos>
gehazi by the hue that chills thy cheek <eos> and pilate by the hue that sears thine hand <eos> whence all earth 's waters cannot wash the brand <eos> that signs thy soul a manslayer 's though thou speak <eos> all christ , with lips most murderous and most meek <eos> thou set thy foot where england 's used to stand <eos> thou reach thy rod forth over indian land <eos> slave of the slaves that call thee lord , and weak <eos> as their foul tongues who praise thee ! son of them <eos> whose presence put the snows and stars to shame <eos> in centuries dead and damned that reek below <eos> curse consecrated , crowned with crime and flame <eos> to them that bare thee like them shalt thou go <eos> forth of man 's life — a leper white as snow <eos>
beauty ( they called her ) was n't a maid <eos> of many things in the world afraid <eos> she was n't a maid who turned and fled <eos> at sight of a mouse , alive or dead <eos> she was n't a maid a man could “ shoo <eos> by shouting , however abruptly , “ boo <eos> she was n't a maid who 'd run and hide <eos> if her face and figure you idly eyed <eos> she was'nt a maid who 'd blush and shake <eos> when asked what part of the fowl she 'd take <eos> ( i blush myself to confess she preferred <eos> and commonly got , the most of the bird <eos> she was n't a maid to simper because <eos> she was asked to sing — if she ever was <eos>
if glorious visions , born for all mankind <eos> the bright auroras of our twilight mind <eos> if fancies , varying as the shapes that lie <eos> stained on the windows of the sunset sky <eos> if hopes , that beckon with delusive gleams <eos> till the eye dances in the void of dreams <eos> if passions , following with the winds that urge <eos> earth 's wildest wanderer to her farthest verge <eos> if these on all some transient hours bestow <eos> of rapture tingling with its hectic glow <eos> then all are poets ; and if earth had rolled <eos> her myriad centuries , and her doom were told <eos> each moaning billow of her shoreless wave <eos> would wail its requiem o'er a poet 's grave <eos>
such as the berecynthian goddesse bright <eos> in her swifte charret with high turrets crownde <eos> proud that so manie gods she brought to light <eos> such was this citie in her good daies fownd <eos> this citie , more than that great phrygian mother <eos> renowm 'd for fruite of famous progenie <eos> whose greatnes by the greatnes of none other <eos> but by her selfe , her equall match could see <eos> rome onely might to rome compared bee <eos> and onely rome could make great rome to tremble <eos> so did the gods by heavenly doome decree <eos> that other earthlie power should not resemble <eos> her that did match the whole earths puissaunce <eos> and did her courage to the heavens advaunce <eos>

thespis began the drama : rumour says <eos> in travelling carts he carried round his plays <eos> where actors , smeared with lees , before the throng <eos> performed their parts with gesture and with song <eos> then aeschylus brought in the mask and pall <eos> put buskins on his men to make them tall <eos> turned boards into a platform , not too great <eos> and taught high monologue and grand debate <eos> the elder comedy had next its turn <eos> nor small the glory it contrived to earn <eos> but freedom passed into unbridled spite <eos> and law was soon invoked to set things right <eos> law spoke : the chorus lost the power to sting <eos> and ( shame to say ) thenceforth refused to sing <eos>
i cannot tell what change hath come to you <eos> to vex your splendid hair . i only know <eos> one grief . the passion left betwixt us two <eos> like some forsaken watchfire , burneth low <eos> ‘ tis sad to turn and find it dying so <eos> without a hope of resurrection ! yet <eos> o radiant face that found me tired and lone <eos> i shall not for the dear , dead past forget <eos> the sweetest looks of all the summers gone <eos> ah ! time hath made familiar wild regret <eos> for now the leaves are white in last year 's bowers <eos> and now doth sob along the ruined leas <eos> the homeless storm from saddened southern seas <eos> while march sits weeping over withered flowers <eos>
lift up the curtain carefully . all the trees <eos> stand in the dark like drowsy sentinels <eos> the oak is talkative to night ; he tells <eos> the little bushes crowding at his knees <eos> that formidable , hard , voluminous <eos> history of growth from acorn into age <eos> they titter like school children ; they arouse <eos> their comrades , who exclaim : ‘ he is very sage <eos> look how the moon is staring through that cloud <eos> laying and lifting idle streaks of light <eos> o hark ! was that the monstrous wind , so loud <eos> and sudden , prowling always through the night <eos> let down the shaking curtain . they are queer <eos> those foreigners . they and we live so near <eos>
eastward was built a gate of marble white <eos> the like adorned the western opposite <eos> a nobler object than this fabric was <eos> rome never saw , nor of so vast a space <eos> for , rich with spoils of many a conquered land <eos> all arts and artists theseus could command <eos> who sold for hire , or wrought for better fame <eos> the master painters and the carvers came <eos> so rose within the compass of the year <eos> an age 's work , a glorious theatre <eos> then o'er its eastern gate was raised above <eos> a temple , sacred to the queen of love <eos> an altar stood below ; on either hand <eos> a priest with roses crowned , who held a myrtle wand <eos>
the passing traveller with wonder sees <eos> a deep and ancient stonepit full of trees <eos> so deep and very deep the place has been <eos> the church might stand within and not be seen <eos> the passing stranger oft with wonder stops <eos> and thinks he een could walk upon their tops <eos> and often stoops to see the busy crow <eos> and stands above and sees the eggs below <eos> and while the wild horse gives its head a toss <eos> the squirrel dances up and runs across <eos> the boy that stands and kills the black nosed bee <eos> dares down as soon as magpies ’ nests are found <eos> and wonders when he climbs the highest tree <eos> to find it reaches scarce above the ground <eos>
to check the invader 's horror spreading course <eos> the barrier fort opposed unequal force <eos> that fort whose walls , extending wide , contained <eos> the stay of persia , men to battle trained <eos> soon as huj í r the dusky crowd descried <eos> he on his own presumptuous arm relied <eos> and left the fort ; in mail with shield and spear <eos> vaunting he spoke — “ what hostile force is here <eos> what chieftain dares our war like realms invade <eos> “ and who art thou ? ” sohr á b indignant said <eos> rushing towards him with undaunted look <eos> “ hast thou , audacious ! nerve and soul to brook <eos> the crocodile in fight , that to the strife <eos> singly thou comest , reckless of thy life <eos>
‘ o hapless youth !— for she thy love hath won <eos> the tender zara will be most undone <eos> big swell 'd my heart , and own 'd the powerful maid <eos> when fast she dropt her tears , as thus she said <eos> “ farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain <eos> whom zara 's breaking heart implored in vain <eos> yet , as thou go'st , may every blast arise <eos> weak and unfelt , as these rejected sighs <eos> safe o'er the wild , no perils mayst thou see <eos> no griefs endure , nor weep , false youth , like me <eos> o let me safely to the fair return <eos> say , with a kiss , she must not , shall not mourn <eos> o ! let me teach my heart to lose its fears <eos> recall 'd by wisdom 's voice , and zara 's tears <eos>
run , shepherds , run where bethlehem blest appears <eos> we bring the best of news ; be not dismayed <eos> a saviour there is born more old than years <eos> amidst heaven 's rolling heights this earth who stayed <eos> in a poor cottage inned , a virgin maid <eos> a weakling did him bear , who all upbears <eos> there is he poorly swaddled , in manger laid <eos> to whom too narrow swaddlings are our spheres <eos> run , shepherds , run , and solemnize his birth <eos> this is that night — no , day , grown great with bliss <eos> in which the power of satan broken is <eos> in heaven be glory , peace unto the earth <eos> thus singing , through the air the angels swarm <eos> and cope of stars re echoed the same <eos>
it is my dream to have you here with me <eos> out of the heated city 's dust and din <eos> here where the colts have room to gambol in <eos> and kine to graze , in clover to the knee <eos> i want to see your wan face happily <eos> lit with the wholesome smiles that have not been <eos> in use since the old games you used to win <eos> when we pitched horseshoes : and i want to be <eos> at utter loaf with you in this dim land <eos> of grove and meadow , while the crickets make <eos> our own talk tedious , and the bat wields <eos> his bulky flight , as we cease converse and <eos> in a dusk like velvet smoothly take <eos> our way toward home across the dewy fields <eos>
impelled by feelings in their nature kind <eos> but slightly weak and somewhat undefined <eos> rush at each other , make a sudden stand <eos> begin to talk , expatiate , and expand <eos> each looks quite radiant , seems extremely struck <eos> their meeting so was such a piece of luck <eos> each thinks the other thinks he ‘ s greatly pleased <eos> to screw the vice in which they both are squeezed <eos> so there they talk , in dust , or mud , or snow <eos> both bored to death , and both afraid to go <eos> your hat once lifted , do not hang your fire <eos> nor , like slow ajax , fighting still , retire <eos> when your old castor on your crown you clap <eos> go off ; you 've mounted your percussion cap <eos>
their course had hardly run three other days <eos> when fair aminta , studious still of ways <eos> to have her wish , again to alice came <eos> to give dear cleon notice of her flame <eos> my home , cried she , ‘ tis requisite i leave <eos> to ruin me , your cousin , i perceive <eos> is still resolved , for presents now he sends <eos> but he mistakes , and blindly wealth expends <eos> i 'm clearly not the woman he suspects <eos> see here , what jewels rare to please the sex <eos> nice rubies , diamonds too , but what is more <eos> my portrait i have found among the store <eos> which must have been from memory designed <eos> since only with my husband that you 'll find <eos>
a dimness of a glory glimmers here <eos> thro ’ veils and distance from the space remote <eos> a faintest far vibration of a note <eos> reaches to us and seems to bring us near <eos> causing our face to glow with braver cheer <eos> making the serried mist to stand afloat <eos> subduing languor with an antidote <eos> and strengthening love almost to cast out fear <eos> till for one moment golden city walls <eos> rise looming on us , golden walls of home <eos> light of our eyes until the darkness falls <eos> then thro ’ the outer darkness burdensome <eos> i hear again the tender voice that calls <eos> “ follow me hither , follow , rise , and come <eos>
the stars come out ; the fragrant shadows fall <eos> about a dreaming garden still and sweet <eos> i hear the unseen bats above me bleat <eos> among the ghostly moths their hunting call <eos> and twinkling glow worms all about me crawl <eos> now for a chamber dim , a pillow meet <eos> for slumbers deep as death , a faultless sheet <eos> cool , white and smooth . so may i reach the hall <eos> with poppies strewn where sleep that is so dear <eos> with magic sponge can wipe away an hour <eos> or twelve and make them naught . why not a year <eos> why could a man not loiter in that bower <eos> until a thousand painless cycles wore <eos> and then what if it held him evermore <eos>
upon my word , replied another fair <eos> if he were mine , i openly declare <eos> to judge from what so pleasantly you say <eos> i 'd make a present of him new year 's day <eos> for pleasure never gives me full delight <eos> unless a little pain the bliss invite <eos> no doubt your husband moves as he is led <eos> thank heav'n a different mortal claims my bed <eos> to take him in , great nicety we need <eos> but howsoe'er , at times i can succeed <eos> the satisfaction doubly then is felt <eos> in fond emotion bosoms freely melt <eos> with neither of you , husband or gallant <eos> would i exchange , though these so much you vaunt <eos>
he plays with other boys when work is done <eos> but feels too clumsy and too stiff to run <eos> yet where there 's mischief he can find a way <eos> the first to join and last [ to run ] away <eos> what 's said or done he never hears or minds <eos> but gets his pence for all the eggs he finds <eos> he thinks his master 's horses far the best <eos> and always labours longer than the rest <eos> in frost and cold though lame he 's forced to go <eos> the call 's more urgent when he journeys slow <eos> in surly speed he helps the maids by force <eos> and feeds the cows and hallos till he 's hoarse <eos> and when he 's lame they only jest and play <eos> and bid him throw his kiby heels away <eos>
when old jack died , it seemed a human friend <eos> had suddenly gone from us ; that some face <eos> that we had loved to fondle and embrace <eos> from babyhood , no more would condescend <eos> to smile on us forever . we might bend <eos> with tearful eyes above him , interlace <eos> our chubby fingers o'er him , romp and race <eos> plead with him , call and coax — aye , we might send <eos> the old halloo up for him , whistle , hist <eos> ( if sobs had let us ) or , as wildly vain <eos> snapped thumbs , called “ speak , ” and he had not replied <eos> we might have gone down on our knees and kissed <eos> the tousled ears , and yet they must remain <eos> deaf , motionless , we knew — when old jack died <eos>
in april 's gilded morn when south winds blow <eos> and gently shake the hawthorn 's silver crown <eos> wafting its scent the forest glade adown <eos> the dewy shelter of the bounding doe <eos> then , under trees , soft tufts of primrose show <eos> their palely yellowing flowers ;— to the moist sun <eos> blue harebells peep , while cowslips stand unblown <eos> plighted to riper may ;— and lavish flow <eos> the lark 's loud carols in the wilds of air <eos> o ! not to nature 's glad enthusiast cling <eos> avarice , and pride .— thro ’ her now blooming sphere <eos> charm 'd as he roves , his thoughts enraptur 'd spring <eos> to him , who gives frail man 's appointed time <eos> these cheering hours of promise , and of prime <eos>
autumn in oregon — i 'll never see <eos> those hills again , a blur of blue and rain <eos> across the old willamette . i 'll not stir <eos> a pheasant as i walk , and hear it whirr <eos> above my head , an indolent , trusting thing <eos> when all this silly dream is finished here <eos> the fellows will go home to where there fall <eos> rose petals over every street , and all <eos> the year is like a friendly festival <eos> but i shall never watch those hedges drip <eos> color , not see the tall spar of a ship <eos> in our old harbor . — they say that i am dying <eos> perhaps that 's why it all comes back again <eos> autumn in oregon and pheasants flying <eos>
so am i as the rich whose blessed key <eos> can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure <eos> the which he will not every hour survey <eos> for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure <eos> therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare <eos> since seldom coming in that long year set <eos> like stones of worth they thinly placed are <eos> or captain jewels in the carcanet <eos> so is the time that keeps you as my chest <eos> or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide <eos> to make some special instant special blest <eos> by new unfolding his imprisoned pride <eos> blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope <eos> being had to triumph , being lacked to hope <eos>
ye , who by the couches of languishing ones <eos> have watched through the rising and setting of suns <eos> who , silent , behind the close curtain , withdrawn <eos> scarce know that the current of being sweeps on <eos> to whom outer life is unreal , untrue <eos> a world with whose moils ye have nothing to do <eos> who feel that the day , with its multiform rounds <eos> is full of discordant , impertinent sounds <eos> who speak in low whispers , and stealthily tread <eos> as if a faint footfall were something to dread <eos> who find all existence ,— its gladness , its gloom <eos> enclosed by the walls of that limited room <eos> ye only can measure the sleepless unrest <eos> that lies like a night mare on alice 's breast <eos>
i was no coward . country bred and born <eos> i had no feeling but the keenest scorn <eos> for those fine lady “ ah 's ” and “ oh 's ” of fear <eos> so much assumed ( when any man is near <eos> but god implanted in each human heart <eos> a natural horror , and a sickly dread <eos> of that accursed , slimy , creeping thing <eos> that squirms a limbless carcass o'er the ground <eos> and where that inborn loathing is not found <eos> you 'll find the serpent qualities instead <eos> who fears it not , himself is next of kin <eos> and in his bosom holds some treacherous art <eos> whereby to counteract its venomed sting <eos> and all are sired by satan — chief of sin <eos>
‘ tis said , for forty days the spectre stayed <eos> for forty days the knight incessant prayed <eos> with scourge , with vigil and ascetic rite <eos> with fast , with groan remorseful and contrite <eos> he cleansed his blackened spirit by degrees <eos> and purified it from its vanities <eos> and as he prayed , the spectre 's gruesome scowl <eos> grew day by day less hideous and foul <eos> as he waxed holy , it became more bright <eos> and after forty days , arrayed in white <eos> it spread its spotless arms , devoid of taint <eos> above this erstwhile knight and henceforth saint <eos> in benediction , as he knelt in prayer <eos> then vanished instantly to empty air <eos>
long has the pall of midnight quench 'd the scene <eos> and wrapt the hush 'd horizon .— all around <eos> in scatter 'd huts , labor , in sleep profound <eos> lies stretch 'd , and rosy innocence serene <eos> slumbers ;— but creeps , with pale and starting mien <eos> benighted superstition .— fancy found <eos> the late self slaughter 'd man , in earth yet green <eos> and festering , burst from his incumbent mound <eos> roams !— and the slave of terror thinks he hears <eos> a mutter 'd groan !— sees the sunk eye , that glares <eos> as shoots the meteor .— but no more forlorn <eos> he strays ;— the spectre sinks into his tomb <eos> for now the jocund herald of the morn <eos> claps his bold wings , and sounds along the gloom <eos>
the world is too much with us ; late and soon <eos> getting and spending , we lay waste our powers <eos> little we see in nature that is ours <eos> we have given our hearts away , a sordid boon <eos> this sea that bares her bosom to the moon <eos> the winds that will be howling at all hours <eos> and are up gathered now like sleeping flowers <eos> for this , for everything , we are out of tune <eos> it moves us not .— great god ! i 'd rather be <eos> a pagan suckled in a creed outworn <eos> so might i , standing on this pleasant lea <eos> have glimpses that would make me less forlorn <eos> have sight of proteus rising from the sea <eos> or hear old triton blow his wreath è d horn <eos>
meanwhile , convened at priam ’ s palace gate <eos> the trojan peers in nightly council sate <eos> a senate void of order , as of choice <eos> their hearts were fearful , and confused their voice <eos> antenor , rising , thus demands their ear <eos> “ ye trojans , dardans , and auxiliars , hear <eos> ’ tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires <eos> and i but move what every god requires <eos> let sparta ’ s treasures be this hour restored <eos> and argive helen own her ancient lord <eos> the ties of faith , the sworn alliance , broke <eos> our impious battles the just gods provoke <eos> as this advice ye practise , or reject <eos> so hope success , or dread the dire effect <eos>
so is it with this singing art of ours <eos> that once with maids went maidenlike , and played <eos> with woven dances in the poplar shade <eos> and all her song was but of lady 's bowers <eos> and the returning swallows , and spring flowers <eos> till forth to seek a shadow queen she strayed <eos> a shadowy land ; and now hath overweighed <eos> her singing chaplet with the snow and showers <eos> yes , fair well water for the bitter brine <eos> she left , and by the margin of life 's sea <eos> sings , and her song is full of the sea 's moan <eos> and wild with dread , and love of proserpine <eos> and whoso once has listened to her , he <eos> his whole life long is slave to her alone <eos>
how many a time , while sauntering up and down <eos> the forum 's space , or pausing ‘ neath the shade <eos> of some grand temple , arch , or portico <eos> have we discussed some knotty point of law <eos> some curious case , whose contradicting facts <eos> looked janus faced to innocence and guilt <eos> i see you now arresting me , to note <eos> with quiet fervor and uplifted hand <eos> some subtle view or fact by me o'erlooked <eos> and urging me , who always strain my point <eos> ( being too much , i know , a partisan <eos> to pause , and press not to the issue so <eos> but more apart , with less impetuous zeal <eos> survey as from an upper floor the facts <eos>
the wind was soft before the sunset fled <eos> now , while the cloud enshrouded corpse of day <eos> is lowered along a red funereal way <eos> down to the dark that knows not white from red <eos> a clear sheer breeze against the night makes head <eos> serene , but sure of life as ere a ray <eos> springs , or the dusk of dawn knows red from grey <eos> being as a soul that knows not quick from dead <eos> from far beyond the sunset , far above <eos> full toward the starry soundless east it blows <eos> bright as a child 's breath breathing on a rose <eos> smooth to the sense as plume of any dove <eos> till more and more as darkness grows and glows <eos> silence and night seem likest life and love <eos>
then still abiding in that ensign rang 'd <eos> wherewith the romans over awed the world <eos> those burning splendours of the holy spirit <eos> took up the strain ; and thus it spake again <eos> “ none ever hath ascended to this realm <eos> who hath not a believer been in christ <eos> either before or after the blest limbs <eos> were nail 'd upon the wood . but lo ! of those <eos> who call ‘ christ , christ , ’ there shall be many found <eos> in judgment , further off from him by far <eos> than such , to whom his name was never known <eos> christians like these the ethiop shall condemn <eos> when that the two assemblages shall part <eos> one rich eternally , the other poor <eos>
weary was love and sought to take his rest <eos> he made his choice , upon a virgin 's lap <eos> and slyly crept from thence unto her breast <eos> where still he meant to sport him in his hap <eos> the virgin frowned like phoebus in a cloud <eos> “ go pack , sir boy , here is no room for such <eos> my breast no wanton foolish boy must shroud <eos> this said , my love did give the wag a touch <eos> then as the foot that treads the stinging snake <eos> hastes to be gone , for fear what may ensue <eos> so love my love was forced for to forsake <eos> and for more speed , without his arrows flew <eos> “ pardon , ” he said , “ for why ? you seemed to me <eos> my mother venus in her pride to be <eos>
thou who hast borne all burdens , bear our load <eos> bear thou our load whatever load it be <eos> our guilt , our shame , our helpless misery <eos> bear thou who only canst , o god my god <eos> seek us and find us , for we cannot thee <eos> or seek or find or hold or cleave unto <eos> we cannot do or undo ; lord , undo <eos> our self undoing , for thine is the key <eos> of all we are not though we might have been <eos> dear lord , if ever mercy moved thy mind <eos> if so be love of us can move thee yet <eos> if still the nail prints in thy hands are seen <eos> remember us ,— yea , how shouldst thou forget <eos> remember us for good , and seek , and find <eos>
“ the land of cyclops first , a savage kind <eos> nor tamed by manners , nor by laws confined <eos> untaught to plant , to turn the glebe , and sow <eos> they all their products to free nature owe <eos> the soil , untill 'd , a ready harvest yields <eos> with wheat and barley wave the golden fields <eos> spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour <eos> and jove descends in each prolific shower <eos> by these no statues and no rights are known <eos> no council held , no monarch fills the throne <eos> but high on hills , or airy cliffs , they dwell <eos> or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell <eos> each rules his race , his neighbour not his care <eos> heedless of others , to his own severe <eos>
sometimes in verse i praised , sometimes in verse sighed <eos> no more shall pen with love and beauty mell <eos> but to my heart alone my heart shall tell <eos> how unseen flames do burn it day and night <eos> lest flames give light , light bring my love to sight <eos> and my love prove my folly to excel <eos> wherefore my love burns like the fire of hell <eos> wherein is fire and yet there is no light <eos> for if one never loved like me , then why <eos> skill less blames he the thing he doth not know <eos> and he that so hath loved should favour show <eos> for he hath been a fool as well as i <eos> thus shall henceforth more pain , more folly have <eos> and folly past , may justly pardon crave <eos>
the chief of lara is returned again <eos> and why had lara crossed the bounding main <eos> left by his sire , too young such loss to know <eos> lord of himself ,— that heritage of woe <eos> that fearful empire which the human breast <eos> but holds to rob the heart within of rest <eos> with none to check , and few to point in time <eos> the thousand paths that slope the way to crime <eos> then , when he most required commandment , then <eos> had lara 's daring boyhood governed men . [ jc <eos> it skills not , boots not step by step to trace <eos> his youth through all the mazes of its race <eos> short was the course his restlessness had run , [ jd <eos> but long enough to leave him half undone <eos>
without delay they to the convent flew <eos> but when the holy mansion came in view <eos> respect , the place of execution changed <eos> a citizen his barn for this arranged <eos> the crafty crew together were confined <eos> and in the blaze their wretched lives resigned <eos> while round the husbands danced at sound of drum <eos> and burnt whatever to their hands had come <eos> naught ‘ scaped their fury , monks of all degrees <eos> robes , mantles , capuchins , and mock decrees <eos> all perished properly within the flames <eos> but nothing more i find about the dames <eos> and friar gerard , in another place <eos> had met apart his merited disgrace <eos>
th ’ ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight <eos> eager of action , and demand the fight <eos> then king tolumnius , vers 'd in augurs ’ arts <eos> cries out , and thus his boasted skill imparts <eos> “ at length ‘ t is granted , what i long desir 'd <eos> this , this is what my frequent vows requir 'd <eos> ye gods , i take your omen , and obey <eos> advance , my friends , and charge ! i lead the way <eos> these are the foreign foes , whose impious band <eos> like that rapacious bird , infest our land <eos> but soon , like him , they shall be forc 'd to sea <eos> by strength united , and forego the prey <eos> your timely succor to your country bring <eos> haste to the rescue , and redeem your king <eos>
thinking of you , and all that was , and all <eos> that might have been and now can never be <eos> i feel your honored excellence , and see <eos> myself unworthy of the happier call <eos> for woe is me who walk so apt to fall <eos> so apt to shrink afraid , so apt to flee <eos> apt to lie down and die ( ah , woe is me <eos> faithless and hopeless turning to the wall <eos> and yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite <eos> because not loveless ; love may toil all night <eos> but take at morning ; wrestle till the break <eos> of day , but then wield power with god and man <eos> so take i heart of grace as best i can <eos> ready to spend and be spent for your sake <eos>
quirinus , bacchus , and the jove born pair <eos> though now invoked with in cense , gifts , and prayer <eos> while yet on earth they civilized their kind <eos> tilled lands , built cities , properties assigned <eos> oft mourned for man 's ingratitude , and found <eos> the race they served less thankful than the ground <eos> the prince whose fated vassalage subdued <eos> fell hydra 's power and all the monster brood <eos> soon found that envy , worse than all beside <eos> could only be extinguished when he died <eos> he that outshines his age is like a torch <eos> which , when it blazes high , is apt to scorch <eos> men hate him while he lives : at last , no doubt <eos> he wins affection — when his light is out <eos>
ah me ! and i am now the man whose muse <eos> in happier times was wont to laugh at love <eos> and those who suffer 'd that blind boy abuse <eos> the noble gifts were given them from above <eos> what metamorphose strange is this i prove i <eos> myself now scarce i find myself to be <eos> and think no fable circe 's tyranny <eos> and all the tales are told of changed jove <eos> virtue hath taught with her philosophy <eos> my mind into a better course to move <eos> reason may chide her fill , and oft reprove <eos> affection 's power , but what is that to me <eos> who ever think , and never think on ought <eos> but that bright cherubim which thralls my thought <eos>
he said ; and high before the tiger train <eos> with longer strides hangs forward o'er the slain <eos> bends like a falling tree to reach the foe <eos> and o'er tall capac aims a forceful blow <eos> the king beheld the ax , and with his wand <eos> struck the raised weapon from the sachem 's hand <eos> then clench 'd the falling helve , and whirling round <eos> fell 'd a close file of heroes to the ground <eos> nor stay 'd , but follow 'd where his people run <eos> fearing to fight , forsaken by the sun <eos> till cusco 's walls salute their longing sight <eos> and the wide gates receive their rapid flight <eos> the folds are barr 'd , the foes in shade conceal 'd <eos> like howling wolves , rave round the frighted field <eos>
i call no goddess to inspire my strains <eos> a fabled muse may suit a bard that feigns <eos> friend of my life ! my ardent spirit burns <eos> and all the tribute of my heart returns <eos> for boons accorded , goodness ever new <eos> the gifts still dearer , as the giver you <eos> thou orb of day ! thou other paler light <eos> and all ye many sparkling stars of night <eos> if aught that giver from my mind efface <eos> if i that giver 's bounty e'er disgrace <eos> then roll to me along your wand'rig spheres <eos> only to number out a villain 's years <eos> i lay my hand upon my swelling breast <eos> and grateful would , but cannot speak the rest <eos>
lord of my love , to whom in vassalage <eos> thy merit hath my duty strongly knit <eos> to thee i send this written embassage <eos> to witness duty , not to show my wit <eos> duty so great , which wit so poor as mine <eos> may make seem bare , in wanting words to show it <eos> but that i hope some good conceit of thine <eos> in thy soul 's thought ( all naked ) will bestow it <eos> till whatsoever star that guides my moving <eos> points on me graciously with fair aspect <eos> and puts apparel on my tattered loving <eos> to show me worthy of thy sweet respect <eos> then may i dare to boast how i do love thee <eos> till then , not show my head where thou mayst prove me <eos>
the kind instructor in these words began <eos> “ ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now <eos> i ’ th ’ second round , and shalt be , till thou come <eos> upon the horrid sand : look therefore well <eos> around thee , and such things thou shalt behold <eos> as would my speech discredit . ” on all sides <eos> i heard sad plainings breathe , and none could see <eos> from whom they might have issu 'd . in amaze <eos> fast bound i stood . he , as it seem 'd , believ 'd <eos> that i had thought so many voices came <eos> from some amid those thickets close conceal 'd <eos> and thus his speech resum 'd : “ if thou lop off <eos> a single twig from one of those ill plants <eos> the thought thou hast conceiv 'd shall vanish quite <eos>
festivals have i seen that were not names <eos> this is young buonaparte 's natal day <eos> and his is henceforth an established sway <eos> consul for life . with worship france proclaims <eos> her approbation , and with pomps and games <eos> heaven grant that other cities may be gay <eos> calais is not : and i have bent my way <eos> to the sea coast , noting that each man frames <eos> his business as he likes . another time <eos> that was , when i was here long years ago <eos> the senselessness of joy was then sublime <eos> happy is he , who , caring not for pope <eos> consul , or king , can sound himself to know <eos> the destiny of man , and live in hope <eos>
what a night ! the wind howls , hisses , and but stops <eos> to howl more loud , while the snow volley keeps <eos> incessant batter at the window pane <eos> making our comfort feel as sweet again <eos> and in the morning , when the tempest drops <eos> at every cottage door mountainous heaps <eos> of snow lie drifted , that all entrance stops <eos> untill the beesom and the shovel gain <eos> the path , and leave a wall on either side <eos> the shepherd rambling valleys white and wide <eos> with new sensations his old memory fills <eos> when hedges left at night , no more descried <eos> are turned to one white sweep of curving hills <eos> and trees turned bushes half their bodies hide <eos>
bride of the shark , her valour first i sing <eos> who on the lone seas quickened of a king <eos> she , from the shore and puny homes of men <eos> beyond the climber 's sea discerning ken <eos> swam , led by omens ; and devoid of fear <eos> beheld her monstrous paramour draw near <eos> she gazed ; all round her to the heavenly pale <eos> the simple sea was void of isle or sail <eos> sole overhead the unsparing sun was reared <eos> when the deep bubbled and the brute appeared <eos> but she , secure in the decrees of fate <eos> made strong her bosom and received the mate <eos> and , men declare , from that marine embrace <eos> conceived the virtues of a stronger race <eos>
“ queen of this strange and spectral land , wilt thou <eos> not show thy favor to a lonesome child <eos> come wandering all this way , impelled by love <eos> not hate , ambition , curiosity <eos> have led me to thy fair and fearful presence <eos> i have no power , am but a weak young girl <eos> and chance , alone , has thus revealed to me <eos> the mystic glory of this unknown world <eos> with thy bright self and this enchanted isle <eos> this pearl upon the bosom of the deep <eos> so palely , purely fair — undreamed of beauty <eos> love is the sole excuse which i can urge <eos> for my intrusion ” — here the stranger blushed <eos> drooping in silence her embarrassed head <eos>
time flies , hope flags , life plies a wearied wing <eos> death following hard on life gains ground apace <eos> faith runs with each and rears an eager face <eos> outruns the rest , makes light of everything <eos> spurns earth , and still finds breath to pray and sing <eos> while love ahead of all uplifts his praise <eos> still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace <eos> content with all day brings and night will bring <eos> life wanes ; and when love folds his wings above <eos> tired hope , and less we feel his conscious pulse <eos> let us go fall asleep , dear friend , in peace <eos> a little while , and age and sorrow cease <eos> a little while , and life reborn annuls <eos> loss and decay and death , and all is love <eos>
like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore <eos> so do our minutes hasten to their end <eos> each changing place with that which goes before <eos> in sequent toil all forwards do contend <eos> nativity once in the main of light <eos> crawls to maturity , wherewith being crowned <eos> crooked eclipses ‘ gainst his glory fight <eos> and time that gave , doth now his gift confound <eos> time doth transfix the flourish set on youth <eos> and delves the parallels in beauty 's brow <eos> feeds on the rarities of nature 's truth <eos> and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow <eos> and yet to times in hope , my verse shall stand <eos> praising thy worth , despite his cruel hand <eos>
on the green bank i sat , and listen 'd long <eos> ( sitting was more convenient for the song <eos> nor till her lay was ended could i move <eos> but wish 'd to dwell for ever in the grove <eos> only methought the time too swiftly pass 'd <eos> and every note i fear 'd would be the last <eos> my sight and smell , and hearing were employ 'd <eos> and all three senses in full gust enjoy 'd <eos> and what alone did all the rest surpass <eos> the sweet possession of the fairy place <eos> single , and conscious to myself alone <eos> of pleasures to the excluded world unknown <eos> pleasures which nowhere else were to be found <eos> and all elysium in a spot of ground <eos>
remember me when i am gone away <eos> gone far away into the silent land <eos> when you can no more hold me by the hand <eos> nor i half turn to go yet turning stay <eos> remember me when no more day by day <eos> you tell me of our future that you planned <eos> only remember me ; you understand <eos> it will be late to counsel then or pray <eos> yet if you should forget me for a while <eos> and afterwards remember , do not grieve <eos> for if the darkness and corruption leave <eos> a vestige of the thoughts that once i had <eos> better by far you should forget and smile <eos> than that you should remember and be sad <eos>
‘ but when we left , in those deep woods we found <eos> a knight of thine spear stricken from behind <eos> dead , whom we buried ; more than one of us <eos> cried out on garlon , but a woodman there <eos> reported of some demon in the woods <eos> was once a man , who driven by evil tongues <eos> from all his fellows , lived alone , and came <eos> to learn black magic , and to hate his kind <eos> with such a hate , that when he died , his soul <eos> became a fiend , which , as the man in life <eos> was wounded by blind tongues he saw not whence <eos> strikes from behind . this woodman showed the cave <eos> from which he sallies , and wherein he dwelt <eos> we saw the hoof print of a horse , no more <eos>
all in the trossachs ’ glen was still <eos> noontide was sleeping on the hill <eos> sudden his guide whooped loud and high <eos> “ murdoch ! was that a signal cry <eos> he stammered forth — “ i shout to scare <eos> yon raven from his dainty fare <eos> he looked — he knew the raven 's prey <eos> his own brave steed — “ ah ! gallant gray <eos> for thee — for me , perchance — ‘ twere well <eos> we ne'er had seen the trossachs ’ dell <eos> murdoch , move first — but silently <eos> whistle or whoop , and thou shalt die <eos> jealous and sullen on they fared <eos> each silent , each upon his guard <eos>
but we who know thee , proudly point the hand <eos> where thy broad rivers roll serenely grand <eos> where , in still beauty ‘ neath our northern sky <eos> thy lordly lakes in solemn grandeur lie <eos> where old niagara 's awful voice has given <eos> the flood 's deep anthem to the ear of heaven <eos> through the long ages of the vanished past <eos> through summer 's bloom , and winter 's angry blast <eos> nature 's proud utterance of unwearied song <eos> now , as at first , majestic , solemn , strong <eos> and ne'er to fail , till the archangel 's cry <eos> shall still the million tones of earth and sky <eos> and send the shout to ocean 's farthest shore <eos> “ be hushed ye voices — time shall be no more <eos>
what though , for showing truth to flatter 'd state <eos> kind hunt was shut in prison , yet has he <eos> in his immortal spirit , been as free <eos> as the sky searching lark , and as elate <eos> minion of grandeur ! think you he did wait <eos> think you he nought but prison walls did see <eos> till , so unwilling , thou unturn'dst the key <eos> ah , no ! far happier , nobler was his fate <eos> in spenser 's halls he strayed , and bowers fair <eos> culling enchanted flowers ; and he flew <eos> with daring milton through the fields of air <eos> to regions of his own his genius true <eos> took happy flights . who shall his fame impair <eos> when thou art dead , and all thy wretched crew <eos>
she turns her head and in a flash of laughter <eos> looks up at him : and helplessly he feels <eos> that life has circled with returning wheels <eos> back to a starting point . before and after <eos> merge in this instant , momently the same <eos> for it was thus she leaned and laughing turned <eos> when , manifest , the spirit of beauty burned <eos> in her young body with an inward flame <eos> and first he knew and loved her . in full tide <eos> life halts within him , suddenly stupefied <eos> sight blackness , lightning struck ; but blindly tender <eos> he draws her up to meet him , and she lies <eos> close folded by his arms in glad surrender <eos> smiling , and with drooped head and half closed eyes <eos>
mute was the mighty organ . none might break <eos> the silence that had thralled it since was stilled <eos> the master hand beneath whose touch it thrilled <eos> to music such as choiring seraphs make <eos> until a mightier master came to wake <eos> th ’ elusive chords and subtle harmonies <eos> that lay imprisoned in the cold white keys <eos> and once again the soul of music spake <eos> methought my soul 's most perfect melodies <eos> no hand again to sonance could evoke <eos> a silent harp whose potence none might prove <eos> but , lo ! one came who swept its chords and woke <eos> celestial strains , divinest harmonies <eos> responsive to the master touch of love <eos>
o child of mine , my little son , alas <eos> beneath the sunlight of thy gentle eyes <eos> too soon , too soon , what fateful shadows rise <eos> like night foretold in some sweet woodland glass <eos> on tender feet that scarcely bow the grass <eos> what stains are those of ripe pomegranate dyes <eos> when on my breast thy head in slumber lies <eos> what thorns are those that through my heart do pass <eos> and round about these crowds of haunting forms <eos> that burn their splendor through my dimmest dreams <eos> o little child , thou wonder too divine <eos> thy precious body all my bosom warms <eos> with mine own blood , but oftentimes it seems <eos> too dearly loved ,— that yet thou art not mine <eos>
if this be love , to draw a weary breath <eos> to paint on floods till the shore cry to th'air <eos> with downward looks still reading on the earth <eos> these sad memorials of my love 's despair <eos> if this be love , to war against my soul <eos> lie down to wail , rise up to sigh and grieve <eos> the never resting stone of care to roll <eos> still to complain my griefs , whilst none relieve <eos> if this be love , to clothe me with dark thoughts <eos> haunting untrodden paths to wail apart <eos> my pleasures horror , music tragic notes <eos> tears in mine eyes and sorrow at my heart <eos> if this be love , to live a living death <eos> then do i love , and draw this weary breath <eos>
then spake king arthur to sir bedivere <eos> “ the sequel of to day unsolders all <eos> the goodliest fellowship of famous knights <eos> whereof this world holds record . such a sleep <eos> they sleep — the men i loved . i think that we <eos> shall never more , at any future time <eos> delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds <eos> walking about the gardens and the halls <eos> of camelot , as in the days that were <eos> i perish by this people which i made <eos> tho ’ merlin sware that i should come again <eos> to rule once more ; but , let what will be , be <eos> i am so deeply smitten thro ’ the helm <eos> that without help i cannot last till morn <eos>
thou hast made me , and shall thy work decay <eos> repair me now , for now mine end doth haste <eos> i run to death , and death meets me as fast <eos> and all my pleasures are like yesterday <eos> i dare not move my dim eyes any way <eos> despair behind , and death before , doth cast <eos> such terror , and my feeble flesh doth waste <eos> by sin in it , which it towards hell doth weigh <eos> only thou art above , and when towards thee <eos> by thy leave i can look , i rise again <eos> but our old subtle foe so tempteth me <eos> that not one hour myself i can sustain <eos> thy grace may wing me to prevent his art <eos> and thou , like adamant , draw mine iron heart <eos>
x . cease then , nor order imperfection name <eos> our proper bliss depends on what we blame <eos> know thy own point : this kind , this due degree <eos> of blindness , weakness , heaven bestows on thee <eos> submit — in this , or any other sphere <eos> secure to be as bless 'd as thou canst bear <eos> safe in the hand of one disposing power <eos> or in the natal , or the mortal hour <eos> all nature is but art , unknown to thee <eos> all chance , direction , which thou canst not see <eos> all discord , harmony not understood <eos> all partial evil , universal good <eos> and , spite of pride , in erring reason 's spite <eos> one truth is clear , whatever is , is right <eos>
“ not without purpose once more to return <eos> thou find'st me , my casella , where i am <eos> journeying this way ; ” i said , “ but how of thee <eos> hath so much time been lost ? ” he answer 'd straight <eos> “ no outrage hath been done to me , if he <eos> who when and whom he chooses takes , me oft <eos> this passage hath denied , since of just will <eos> his will he makes . these three months past indeed <eos> he , whose chose to enter , with free leave <eos> hath taken ; whence i wand'ring by the shore <eos> where tyber 's wave grows salt , of him gain 'd kind <eos> admittance , at that river 's mouth , tow'rd which <eos> his wings are pointed , for there always throng <eos> all such as not to archeron descend <eos>
and , with rich clusters laden , there was grav'n <eos> a vineyard fair , all gold ; of glossy black <eos> the bunches were , on silver poles sustain 'd <eos> around , a darksome trench ; beyond , a fence <eos> was wrought , of shining tin ; and through it led <eos> one only path , by which the bearers pass 'd <eos> who gather 'd in the vineyard 's bounteous store <eos> there maids and youths , in joyous spirits bright <eos> in woven baskets bore the luscious fruit <eos> a boy , amid them , from a clear ton 'd harp <eos> drew lovely music ; well his liquid voice <eos> the strings accompanied ; they all with dance <eos> and song harmonious join 'd , and joyous shouts <eos> as the gay bevy lightly tripp 'd along <eos>
with how sad steps , o moon ! thou climb'st the skies <eos> how silently , and with how wan a face <eos> what ! may it be , that even in heavenly place <eos> that busy archer his sharp arrows tries <eos> sure , if that long with love acquainted eyes <eos> can judge of love , thou feel'st a lover 's case <eos> i read it in thy looks ; thy languish 'd grace <eos> to me that feel the like , thy state descries <eos> then , even of fellowship , o moon , tell me <eos> is constant love deem 'd there but want of wit <eos> are beauties there as proud as here they be <eos> do they above love to be loved , and yet <eos> those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess <eos> do they call virtue there ungratefulness <eos>
queen regnant she , and so shall be for aye <eos> as long as her still unpolluted sea <eos> shall wash the borders of her brave and free <eos> and mother her incomparable bay <eos> the pharisees and falsehood mongers may <eos> be rashly blatant as they care to be <eos> she yet with dauntless , old time liberty <eos> will hold her own indomitable way <eos> a royal one , all love and heart can bear <eos> the all of strength that human arm can wield <eos> are thine devotedly , and ever thine <eos> and thou wilt use them till thy brow shall wear <eos> a newer crown by high endeavor sealed <eos> with gems emitting brilliances divine <eos>
if there be nothing new , but that which is <eos> hath been before , how are our brains beguiled <eos> which labouring for invention bear amis <eos> the second burthen of a former child <eos> o that record could with a backward look <eos> even of five hundred courses of the sun <eos> show me your image in some antique book <eos> since mind at first in character was done <eos> that i might see what the old world could say <eos> to this composed wonder of your frame <eos> whether we are mended , or whether better they <eos> or whether revolution be the same <eos> o sure i am the wits of former days <eos> to subjects worse have given admiring praise <eos>

then that dread angel near the awful throne <eos> leaving the seraphs ranged in flaming tiers <eos> winged his dark way through those unpinioned spheres <eos> and on the void 's black beetling edge , alone <eos> stood with raised wings , and listened for the tone <eos> of god 's command to reach his eager ears <eos> while chaos wavered , for she felt her years <eos> unsceptered now in that convulsive zone <eos> night trembled . and as one hath oft beheld <eos> a lamp within a vase light up its gloom <eos> so god 's voice lighted him , from heel to plume <eos> “ let there be light ! ” it said , and darkness , quelled <eos> shrunk noiseless backward in her monstrous womb <eos> through vasts unwinnowed by the wings of eld <eos>
‘ my dearest lord ! farewell , ’ said he , ‘ farewell <eos> heaven bless the king ; may no misfortune tell <eos> the injustice of his hate when i am dead <eos> they 're coming now ; perhaps my guiltless head <eos> here , in your sight , must then a bleeding lie <eos> and scarce your own stand safe for being nigh <eos> think me not scared with death , howe'er ‘ t appear <eos> i know thou canst not think so : it is a fear <eos> from which thy love and dammin speaks me free <eos> i 've met him face to face , and ne'er could see <eos> one terror in his looks to make me fly <eos> when virtue bids me stand ; but i would die <eos> so as becomes my life , so as may prove <eos> saul 's malice , and at least excuse your love <eos>
when your perfections to my thoughts appear <eos> they say among themselves , “ o happy we <eos> whichever shall so rare an object see <eos> but happy heart , if thoughts less happy were <eos> for their delights have cost my heart full dear <eos> in whom of love a thousand causes be <eos> and each cause breeds a thousand loves in me <eos> and each love more than thousand hearts can bear <eos> how can my heart so many loves then hold <eos> which yet by heaps increase from day to day <eos> but like a ship that 's o'ercharged with gold <eos> must either sink or hurl the gold away <eos> but hurl not love ; thou canst not , feeble heart <eos> in thine own blood , thou therefore drown è d art <eos>
o pope ! instructor of my studious days <eos> who fix 'd my steps in virtue 's early ways <eos> on whom our labours , and our hopes depend <eos> thou more than patron , and ev'n more than friend <eos> above all flattery , all thirst of gain <eos> and mortal but in sickness , and in pain <eos> thou taught'st old satire nobler fruits to bear <eos> and check 'd her licence with a moral care <eos> thou gav'st the thought new beauties not its own <eos> and touch 'd the verse with graces yet unknown <eos> each lawless branch thy level eye survey 'd <eos> and still corrected nature as she stray 'd <eos> warm 'd boileau 's sense with britain 's genuine fire <eos> and added softness to tasson è' s lyre <eos>
when , looking on the present face of things <eos> i see one man , of men the meanest too <eos> rais 'd up to sway the world , to do , undo <eos> with mighty nations for his underlings <eos> the great events with which old story rings <eos> seem vain and hollow ; i find nothing great <eos> nothing is left which i can venerate <eos> so that almost a doubt within me springs <eos> of providence , such emptiness at length <eos> seems at the heart of all things . but , great god <eos> i measure back the steps which i have trod <eos> and tremble , seeing , as i do , the strength <eos> of such poor instruments , with thoughts sublime <eos> i tremble at the sorrow of the time <eos>
“ still may our souls , o generous youth ! agree <eos> ’ tis now atrides ’ turn to yield to thee <eos> rash heat perhaps a moment might control <eos> not break , the settled temper of thy soul <eos> not but ( my friend ) ’ tis still the wiser way <eos> to waive contention with superior sway <eos> for ah ! how few , who should like thee offend <eos> like thee , have talents to regain the friend <eos> to plead indulgence , and thy fault atone <eos> suffice thy father ’ s merit and thy own <eos> generous alike , for me , the sire and son <eos> have greatly suffer ’ d , and have greatly done <eos> i yield ; that all may know , my soul can bend <eos> nor is my pride preferr ’ d before my friend <eos>
but love whilst that thou mayst be loved again <eos> now whilst thy may hath filled thy lap with flowers <eos> now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain <eos> now use thy summer smiles , ere winter lowers <eos> and whilst thou spread'st unto the rising sun <eos> the fairest flower that ever saw the light <eos> now joy thy time before thy sweet be done <eos> and , delia , think thy morning must have night <eos> and that thy brightness sets at length to west <eos> when thou wilt close up that which now thou showest <eos> and think the same becomes thy fading best <eos> which then shall most inveil and shadow most <eos> men do not weigh the stalk for that it was <eos> when once they find her flower , her glory pass <eos>
ah , woe is me for pleasure that is vain <eos> ah , woe is me for glory that is past <eos> pleasure that bringeth sorrow at the last <eos> glory that at the last bringeth no gain <eos> so saith the sinking heart ; and so again <eos> it shall say till the mighty angel blast <eos> is blown , making the sun and moon aghast <eos> and showering down the stars like sudden rain <eos> and evermore men shall go fearfully <eos> bending beneath their weight of heaviness <eos> and ancient men shall lie down wearily <eos> and strong men shall rise up in weariness <eos> yea , even the young shall answer sighingly <eos> saying one to another : how vain it is <eos>
a rose , as fair as ever saw the north <eos> grew in a little garden all alone <eos> a sweeter flower did nature ne'er put forth <eos> nor fairer garden yet was never known <eos> the maidens danc 'd about it morn and noon <eos> and learned bards of it their ditties made <eos> the nimble fairies by the pale faced moon <eos> water 'd the root and kiss 'd her pretty shade <eos> but well a day , the gard'ner careless grew <eos> the maids and fairies both were kept away <eos> and in a drought the caterpillars threw <eos> themselves upon the bud and every spray <eos> god shield the stock ! if heaven send no supplies <eos> the fairest blossom of the garden dies <eos>
this mighty empire hath but feet of clay <eos> of all its ancient chivalry and might <eos> our little island is forsaken quite <eos> some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay <eos> and from its hills that voice hath passed away <eos> which spake of freedom : o come out of it <eos> come out of it , my soul , thou art not fit <eos> for this vile traffic house , where day by day <eos> wisdom and reverence are sold at mart <eos> and the rude people rage with ignorant cries <eos> against an heritage of centuries <eos> it mars my calm : wherefore in dreams of art <eos> and loftiest culture i would stand apart <eos> neither for god , nor for his enemies <eos>
mountains ! and huge hills ! wrap your mighty forms <eos> close with mantle of eternal cloud <eos> gather around ye the fierce band of storms <eos> and let the stainless snow drift be your shroud <eos> back from your rugged steeps , and caverns hoar <eos> bellow in hoarse disdain the tempest 's roar <eos> laugh at the rolling thunder ; let the flash <eos> of its fierce lightning lumine but your scorn <eos> down your deep furrow 'd slopes let torrents dash <eos> and on the winds their hollow rage be borne <eos> ye mighty ones ! why should ye bow your pride <eos> and doff your venerable crowns , or dress <eos> your wrinkled brows in smiles , or lay aside <eos> the dread insignias of your mightiness <eos>

not long i had observed , when from afar <eos> i heard a sudden symphony of war <eos> the neighing coursers , and the soldiers cry <eos> and sounding trumps , that seem 'd to tear the sky <eos> i saw soon after this , behind the grove <eos> from whence the ladies did in order move <eos> come issuing out in arms a warrior train <eos> that like a deluge pour 'd upon the plain <eos> on barbed steeds they rode in proud array <eos> thick as the college of the bees in may <eos> when swarming o'er the dusky fields they fly <eos> new to the flowers , and intercept the sky <eos> so fierce they drove , their coursers were so fleet <eos> that the turf trembled underneath their feet <eos>
death in a rage assaulted once my heart <eos> with love of her , my love that doth deny <eos> i scorned his force , and wished him to depart <eos> i heartless was , and therefore could not die <eos> i live in her , in her i placed my life <eos> she guides my soul , and her i honour must <eos> nor is this life but yet a living strife <eos> a thing unmeet , and yet a thing most just <eos> cupid enraged did fly to make me love <eos> my heart lay guarded with those burning eyes <eos> the sparks whereof denied him to remove <eos> so conquered now , he like a captive lies <eos> thus two at once by love were both undone <eos> my heart not loved , and armless venus ’ son <eos>
nay , lord , not thus ! white lilies in the spring <eos> sad olive groves , or silver breasted dove <eos> teach me more clearly of thy life and love <eos> than terrors of red flame and thundering <eos> the hillside vines dear memories of thee bring <eos> a bird at evening flying to its nest <eos> tells me of one who had no place of rest <eos> i think it is of thee the sparrows sing <eos> come rather on some autumn afternoon <eos> when red and brown are burnished on the leaves <eos> and the fields echo to the gleaner 's song <eos> come when the splendid fulness of the moon <eos> looks down upon the rows of golden sheaves <eos> and reap thy harvest : we have waited long <eos>
the lady has agreed , you will remark <eos> that in a room where ev'ry part is dark <eos> ( perhaps to ‘ scape the keeper 's prying sight <eos> or shame directs exclusion of the light <eos> she will receive your gay inconstant spouse <eos> now , take her place ; the case deceit allows <eos> make jack your friend ; nor haggle at the price <eos> a hundred ducats give , is my advice <eos> he 'll place you in the room where darkness reigns <eos> think not too fast , nor suffer heavy chains <eos> do what you wish , and utter not a word <eos> to speak , assuredly would be absurd <eos> ‘ twould spoil the whole ; destroy the project quite <eos> attend , and see if all things be not right <eos>
far be the guilt of homeshed blood from all <eos> on whom , unsought , embroiling dangers fall <eos> still the pale dead revives , and lives to me <eos> to me ! through pity 's eye condemned to see <eos> remembrance veils his rage , but swells his fate <eos> grieved i forgive , and am grown cool too late <eos> young , and unthoughtful then ; who knows , one day <eos> what ripening virtues might have made their way <eos> he might have lived till folly died in shame <eos> till kindling wisdom felt a thirst for fame <eos> he might perhaps his country 's friend have proved <eos> both happy , generous , candid , and beloved <eos> he might have saved some worth , now doomed to fall <eos> and i , perchance , in him , have murdered all <eos>

here now is winter . winter , after all <eos> is not so drear as was my boding dream <eos> while autumn gleamed its latest watery gleam <eos> on sapless leafage too inert to fall <eos> still leaves and berries clothe my garden wall <eos> where ivy thrives on scantiest sunny beam <eos> still here a bud and there a blossom seem <eos> hopeful , and robin still is musical <eos> leaves , flowers and fruit and one delightful song <eos> remain ; these days are short , but now the nights <eos> intense and long , hang out their utmost lights <eos> such starry nights are long , yet not too long <eos> frost nips the weak , while strengthening still the strong <eos> against that day when spring sets all to rights <eos>
as due by many titles , i resign <eos> myself to thee , o god ! first i was made <eos> by thee , and for thee ; and when i was decayed <eos> thy blood bought that , the which before was thine <eos> i am thy son , made with thyself to shine <eos> thy servant , whose pains thou hast still repaid <eos> thy sheep , thine image ; and , till i betrayed <eos> myself , a temple of thy spirit divine <eos> why doth the devil then usurp on me <eos> why doth he steal , nay , ravish , that 's thy right <eos> except thou rise , and for thine own work fight <eos> oh ! i shall soon despair , when i shall see <eos> that thou lov'st mankind well , yet wilt not choose me <eos> and satan hates me , yet is loth to lose me <eos>
‘ here let us walk , ’ he said , ‘ observed by none <eos> conscious of pleasures to the world unknown <eos> so may my soul have joy , as thou , my wife <eos> art far the dearest solace of my life <eos> and rather would i choose , by heaven above <eos> to die this instant , than to lose thy love <eos> reflect what truth was in my passion shown <eos> when , unendow 'd , i took thee for my own <eos> and sought no treasure but thy heart alone <eos> old as i am , and now deprived of sight <eos> whilst thou art faithful to thy own true knight <eos> nor age , nor blindness rob me of delight <eos> each other loss with patience i can bear <eos> the loss of thee is what i only fear <eos>
the panther , knowing that his spotted hyde <eos> doth please all beasts , but that his looks them fray <eos> within a bush his dreadful head doth hide <eos> to let them gaze , whylst he on them may pray <eos> right so my cruell fayre with me doth play <eos> for with the goodly semblance of her hew <eos> she doth allure me to mine owne decay <eos> and then no mercy will unto me shew <eos> great shame it is , thing so divine in view <eos> made for to be the worlds most ornament <eos> to make the bayte her gazers to embrew <eos> good shames to be to ill an instrument <eos> but mercy doth with beautie best agree <eos> as in theyr maker ye them best may see <eos>
dear ladies , though last to receive my oblation <eos> and last in the list of mosaic creation <eos> the last is the best , and the last shall be first <eos> through eve , sayeth moses , old adam was cursed <eos> but i cannot agree with you , moses , that adam <eos> sinned and fell through the gentle persuasion of madam <eos> the victim , no doubt , of egyptian flirtation <eos> you mistook your chagrin for divine inspiration <eos> and condemned all the sex without proof or probation <eos> as we rhymsters mistake the moonbeams that elate us <eos> for flashes of wit or the holy afflatus <eos> and imagine we hear the applause of a nation <eos> but all honest men who are married and blest <eos> will agree that the last work of god is the best <eos>

the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts <eos> and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts <eos> at this , the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook <eos> a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look <eos> she sees , and trembles at th ’ approaching ill <eos> just in the jaws of ruin , and codille <eos> and now ( as oft in some distemper 'd state <eos> on one nice trick depends the gen'ral fate <eos> an ace of hearts steps forth : the king unseen <eos> lurk 'd in her hand , and mourn 'd his captive queen <eos> he springs to vengeance with an eager pace <eos> and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace <eos> the nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky <eos> the walls , the woods , and long canals reply <eos>
toward the sea turning my troubled eye <eos> i saw the fish ( if fish i may it cleepe <eos> that makes the sea before his face to flye <eos> and with his flaggie finnes doth seeme to sweepe <eos> the fomie waves out of the dreadfull deep <eos> the huge leviathan , dame natures wonder <eos> making his sport , that manie makes to weep <eos> a sword fish small him from the rest did sunder <eos> that , in his throat him pricking softly under <eos> his wide abysse him forced forth to spewe <eos> that all the sea did roare like heavens thunder <eos> and all the waves were stain 'd with filthie hewe <eos> hereby i learned have not to despise <eos> whatever thing seemes small in common eyes <eos>
receive thine own ; for i and it are thine <eos> thou know'st its story ; how for forty days <eos> weary with sickness and with social haze <eos> ( after thy hands and lips with love divine <eos> had somewhat soothed me , made the glory shine <eos> though with a watery lustre ,) more delays <eos> of blessedness forbid — i took my ways <eos> into a solitude , invention 's mine <eos> there thought and wrote , afar , and yet with thee <eos> those days gone past , i came , and brought a book <eos> my child , developed since in limb and look <eos> it came in shining vapours from the sea <eos> and in thy stead sung low sweet songs to me <eos> when the red life blood labour would not brook <eos>
when beauty to the world vouchsafes this bliss <eos> to show the one whose other there is not <eos> the whitest skins red blushing shame doth blot <eos> and in the reddest cheeks pale envy is <eos> the fair and foul come thus alike by this <eos> for when the sun hath our horizon got <eos> venus herself doth shine no more , god wot <eos> than the least star that takes the light from his <eos> the poor in beauty thus content remain <eos> to see their jealous cause revenged in thee <eos> and their fair foes afflicted with like pain <eos> lo , the clear proof of thy divinity <eos> for unto god is only due this praise <eos> the highest to pluck down , the low to raise <eos>
the lady of the leaf ordain 'd a feast <eos> and made the lady of the flower her guest <eos> when , lo ! a bower ascended on the plain <eos> with sudden seats ordain 'd , and large for either train <eos> this bower was near my pleasant arbour placed <eos> that i could hear and see whatever pass 'd <eos> the ladies sat with each a knight between <eos> distinguish 'd by their colours , white and green <eos> the vanquish 'd party with the victors join 'd <eos> nor wanted sweet discourse , the banquet of the mind <eos> meantime the minstrels play 'd on either side <eos> vain of their art , and for the mastery vied <eos> the sweet contention lasted for an hour <eos> and reach 'd my secret arbour from the bower <eos>
no , friend , you do not beat me : hearken why <eos> the common problem , yours , mine , every one 's <eos> is — not to fancy what were fair in life <eos> provided it could be — but , finding first <eos> what may be , then find how to make it fair <eos> up to our means : a very different thing <eos> no abstract intellectual plan of life <eos> quite irrespective of life 's plainest laws <eos> but one , a man , who is man and nothing more <eos> may lead within a world which ( by your leave <eos> is rome or london , not fool'shyppphenparadise <eos> embellish rome , idealize away <eos> make paradise of london if you can <eos> you 're welcome , nay , you 're wise <eos>
if in this storm of joy and pompous throng <eos> this nymph ( great king ) doth come to thee so near <eos> that thy harmonious ears her accents hear <eos> give pardon to her hoarse and lowly song <eos> fain would she trophies to thy virtues rear <eos> but for this stately task she is not strong <eos> and her defects her high attempts do wrong <eos> yet as she could she makes thy worth appear <eos> so in a map is shown this flowery place <eos> so wrought in arras by a virgin 's hand <eos> with heaven and blazing stars doth atlas stand <eos> so drawn by charcoal is narcissus ’ face <eos> she like the morn may be to some bright sun <eos> the day to perfect that 's by her begun <eos>
ye heralds of my heart , mine ardent groans <eos> o tears which gladly would burst out to brooks <eos> oh spent on fruitless sand my surging moans <eos> oh thoughts enthralled unto care boding looks <eos> ah just laments of my unjust distress <eos> ah fond desires whom reason could not guide <eos> oh hopes of love that intimate redress <eos> yet prove the load stars unto bad betide <eos> when will you cease ? or shall pain never ceasing <eos> seize oh my heart ? oh mollify your rage <eos> lest your assaults with over swift increasing <eos> procure my death , or call on timeless age <eos> what if they do ? they shall but feed the fire <eos> which i have kindled by my fond desire <eos>
there is a race of men , who master life <eos> their victory being inversely as their strife <eos> who capture by refraining from pursuit <eos> shake not the bough , yet load their hands with fruit <eos> the earth 's high places who attain to fill <eos> by most indomitably sitting still <eos> while others , full upon the fortress hurled <eos> lay fiery siege to the embattled world <eos> of such rude arts their natures feel no need <eos> greatly inert , they lazily succeed <eos> find in the golden mean their proper bliss <eos> and doing nothing , never do amiss <eos> but lapt in men 's good graces live , and die <eos> by all regretted , nobody knows why <eos>
with strength of righteous purpose in the heart <eos> what cause to fear for consequence of deed <eos> god guideth then , not we ; nor do we need <eos> to care for aught but that we play our part <eos> most simple trust is often highest art <eos> the issue we would fly may be a seed <eos> ordained by god to bear our souls a meed <eos> of peace that no self judging could impart <eos> “ all things work good for him who trusteth god <eos> doth god not love us with a longing love <eos> to make us happy , and hath he not sight <eos> from end to end of our short earthly road <eos> this , lord , i hold — aye , know that thou wouldst move <eos> the world to lead one trusting soul aright <eos>
this then at last ; we may be wiser far <eos> than love , and put his folly to our measure <eos> yet shall we learn , poor wizards that we are <eos> that love chimes not nor motions at our pleasure <eos> we bid him come , and light an eager fire <eos> and he goes down the road without debating <eos> we cast him from the house of our desire <eos> and when at last we leave he will be waiting <eos> and in the end there is no folly but this <eos> to counsel love out of our little learning <eos> for still he knows where rotten timber is <eos> and where the boughs for the long winter burning <eos> and when life needs no more of us at all <eos> love 's word will be the last that we recall <eos>
thou shouldst have risen as never dawn yet rose <eos> day of the sunrise of the soul of france <eos> dawn of the whole world 's morning , when the trance <eos> of all the world had end , and all its woes <eos> respite , prophetic of their perfect close <eos> light of all tribes of men , all names and clans <eos> dawn of the whole world 's morning and of man 's <eos> flower of the heart of morning 's mystic rose <eos> dawn of the very dawn of very day <eos> when the sun brighter breaks night 's ruinous prison <eos> thou shouldst have risen as yet no dawn has risen <eos> evoked of him whose word puts night away <eos> our father , at the music of whose word <eos> exile had ended , and the world had heard <eos>
in the greek land of old there was a king <eos> happy in battle , rich in everything <eos> most rich in this , that he a daughter had <eos> whose beauty made the longing city glad <eos> she was so fair , that strangers from the sea <eos> just landed , in the temples thought that she <eos> was venus visible to mortal eyes <eos> new come from cyprus for a world 's surprise <eos> she was so beautiful that had she stood <eos> on windy ida by the oaken wood <eos> and bared her limbs to that bold shepherd 's gaze <eos> troy might have stood till now with happy days <eos> and those three fairest , all have left the land <eos> and left her with the apple in her hand <eos>
to whom the king : “ in such distress we stand <eos> no vulgar counsel our affairs demand <eos> greece to preserve , is now no easy part <eos> but asks high wisdom , deep design , and art <eos> for jove , averse , our humble prayer denies <eos> and bows his head to hector ’ s sacrifice <eos> what eye has witness ’ d , or what ear believed <eos> in one great day , by one great arm achieved <eos> such wondrous deeds as hector ’ s hand has done <eos> and we beheld , the last revolving sun <eos> what honours the beloved of jove adorn <eos> sprung from no god , and of no goddess born <eos> yet such his acts , as greeks unborn shall tell <eos> and curse the battle where their fathers fell <eos>
the dark day died , and when the moon arose <eos> the foremost torch in day 's long funeral train <eos> karagwe went down toward the river 's brink <eos> thinking of what had been . he turned and saw <eos> his enemy walk calmly up the road <eos> quickly behind him came another form <eos> and in a jeweled hand , half raised to strike <eos> a poniard glistened . then the negro rose <eos> and caught the weapon from the assassin 's grasp <eos> and stood before the planter , dalton earl <eos> “ forgive , ” he said , “ forgiveness is a slave <eos> she has no pride , she never does an ill <eos> for she is meekly great , and nobly good <eos> and patient , though the lash of anger smites <eos>

there is a bondage which is worse to bear <eos> than his who breathes , by roof , and floor , and wall <eos> pent in , a tyrant 's solitary thrall <eos> ‘ tis his who walks about in the open air <eos> one of a nation who , henceforth , must wear <eos> their fetters in their souls . for who could be <eos> who , even the best , in such condition , free <eos> from self reproach , reproach which he must share <eos> with human nature ? never be it ours <eos> to see the sun how brightly it will shine <eos> and know that noble feelings , manly powers <eos> instead of gathering strength must droop and pine <eos> and earth with all her pleasant fruits and flowers <eos> fade , and participate in man 's decline <eos>
the virtuous delegates behold with pain <eos> the hostile britons hovering o'er the main <eos> lament the strife that bids two worlds engage <eos> and blot their annals with fraternal rage <eos> two worlds in one broad state ! whose bounds bestride <eos> like heaven 's blue arch , the vast atlantic tide <eos> by language , laws and liberty combined <eos> great nurse of thought , example to mankind <eos> columbia rears her warning voice in vain <eos> brothers to brothers call across the main <eos> britannia 's patriots lend a listening ear <eos> but kings and courtiers push their mad career <eos> dissension raves , the sheathless falchions glare <eos> and earth and ocean tremble at the war <eos>
for had she not been fair and thus unkind <eos> then had no finger pointed at my lightness <eos> the world had never known what i do find <eos> and clouds obscure had shaded still her brightness <eos> then had no censor 's eye these lines surveyed <eos> nor graver brows have judged my muse so vain <eos> no sun my blush and error had bewrayed <eos> nor yet the world had heard of such disdain <eos> then had i walked with bold erected face <eos> no downcast look had signified my miss <eos> but my degraded hopes with such disgrace <eos> did force me groan out griefs and utter this <eos> for being full , should i not then have spoken <eos> my sense oppressed had failed and heart had broken <eos>
the sirens once were maidens innocent <eos> that through the water meads with proserpine <eos> plucked no fire hearted flowers , but were content <eos> cool fritillaries and flag flowers to twine <eos> with lilies woven and with wet woodbine <eos> till once they sought the bright aetnaean flowers <eos> and their bright mistress fled from summer hours <eos> with hades , down the irremeable decline <eos> and they have sought her all the wide world through <eos> till many years , and wisdom , and much wrong <eos> have filled and changed their song , and o'er the blue <eos> rings deadly sweet the magic of the song <eos> and whoso hears must listen till he die <eos> far on the flowery shores of sicily <eos>
the fairest flowers that decked the earth <eos> into a nosegay , with wise choice combined <eos> thus the first art from nature had its birth <eos> into a garland then were nosegays twined <eos> and from the works that mortal hands had made <eos> a second , nobler art was now displayed <eos> the child of beauty , self sufficient now <eos> that issued from your hands to perfect day <eos> loses the chaplet that adorned its brow <eos> soon as reality asserts its sway <eos> the column , yielding to proportion 's chains <eos> must with its sisters join in friendly link <eos> the hero in the hero band must sink <eos> the muses ’ harp peals forth its tuneful strains <eos>
sweet cytherea , sitting by a brook <eos> with young adonis , lovely , fresh , and green <eos> did court the lad with many a lovely look <eos> such looks as none could look but beauty 's queen <eos> she told him stories to delight his ear <eos> she show 'd him favours to allure his eye <eos> to win his heart , she touch 'd him here and there <eos> touches so soft still conquer chastity <eos> but whether unripe years did want conceit <eos> or he refused to take her figured proffer <eos> the tender nibbler would not touch the bait <eos> but smile and jest at every gentle offer <eos> then fell she on her back , fair queen , and toward <eos> he rose and ran away ; ah , fool too froward <eos>
a dream there is wherein we are fain to scream <eos> while struggling with ourselves we cannot speak <eos> and much of all our waking life , as weak <eos> and misconceived , eludes us like the dream <eos> for half life 's seemings are not what they seem <eos> and vain the laughs we laugh , the shrieks we shriek <eos> yea , all is vain that mars the settled meek <eos> contented quiet of our daily theme <eos> when i was young i deemed that sweets are sweet <eos> but now i deem some searching bitters are <eos> sweeter than sweets , and more refreshing far <eos> and to be relished more , and more desired <eos> and more to be pursued on eager feet <eos> on feet untired , and still on feet though tired <eos>
if i by gods , by heroes and by men <eos> be re assured , so that i not despair <eos> nor fear , pain , nor the impediments <eos> of death of body , joy and happiness <eos> yet must i learn to suffer and to feel <eos> and that i may my pathways clearly see <eos> let doubts arise , and dolour , and the woe <eos> of vanished hopes , of joy and all delight <eos> but if he should behold , should grant , and should attend <eos> my thoughts , my wishes , and my reasoning <eos> who makes them so uncertain , hot , and vague <eos> such dear conceits , such acts and speech <eos> will not be given nor done to him , who stays <eos> from birth , through life , to death in sheltered home <eos>
i stood beside his sepulchre whose fame <eos> hurled over europe once on bolt and blast <eos> now glows far off as storm clouds overpast <eos> glow in the sunset flushed with glorious flame <eos> has nature marred his mould ? can art acclaim <eos> no hero now , no man with whom men side <eos> as with their hearts ’ high needs personified <eos> there are will say , one such our lips could name <eos> columbia gave him birth . him genius most <eos> gifted to rule . against the world 's great man <eos> lift their low calumny and sneering cries <eos> the pharisaic multitude , the host <eos> of piddling slanderers whose little eyes <eos> know not what greatness is and never can <eos>
was this his coming ! i had hoped to see <eos> a scene of wondrous glory , as was told <eos> of some great god who in a rain of gold <eos> broke open bars and fell on danae <eos> or a dread vision as when semele <eos> sickening for love and unappeased desire <eos> prayed to see god 's clear body , and the fire <eos> caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly <eos> with such glad dreams i sought this holy place <eos> and now with wondering eyes and heart i stand <eos> before this supreme mystery of love <eos> some kneeling girl with passionless pale face <eos> an angel with a lily in his hand <eos> and over both the white wings of a dove <eos>

hear what the desolate rizpah said <eos> as on gibeah 's rocks she watched the dead <eos> the sons of michal before her lay <eos> and her own fair children , dearer than they <eos> by a death of shame they all had died <eos> and were stretched on the bare rock , side by side <eos> and rizpah , once the loveliest of all <eos> that bloomed and smiled in the court of saul <eos> all wasted with watching and famine now <eos> and scorched by the sun her haggard brow <eos> sat mournfully guarding their corpses there <eos> and murmured a strange and solemn air <eos> the low , heart broken , and wailing strain <eos> of a mother that mourns her children slain <eos>
hath he not deeds to do and days to see <eos> yet ere the day that is to see him dead <eos> beats there no brain yet in the poisonous head <eos> throbs there no treason ? if no such thing there be <eos> if no such thought , surely this is not he <eos> look to the hands then ; are the hands not red <eos> what are the shadows about this man 's bed <eos> death , was not this the cupbearer to thee <eos> nay , let him live then , till in this life 's stead <eos> even he shall pray for that thou hast to give <eos> till seeing his hopes and not his memories fled <eos> even he shall cry upon thee a bitter cry <eos> that life is worse than death ; then let him live <eos> till death seem worse than life ; then let him die <eos>
dunbar , no poet wears your laurels now <eos> none rises , singing , from your race like you <eos> dark melodist , immortal , though the dew <eos> fell early on the bays upon your brow <eos> and tinged with pathos every halcyon vow <eos> and brave endeavor . silence o'er you threw <eos> flowerets of love . or , if an envious few <eos> of your own people brought no garlands , how <eos> could malice smite him whom the gods had crowned <eos> if , like the meadow lark , your flight was low <eos> your flooded lyrics half the hilltops drowned <eos> a wide world heard you , and it loved you so <eos> it stilled its heart to list the strains you sang <eos> and o'er your happy songs its plaudits rang <eos>
over the threshold of his pleasant home <eos> set in green clearings passed the exiled friend <eos> in simple trust , misdoubting not the end <eos> “ dear heart of mine ! ” he said , “ the time has come <eos> to trust the lord for shelter . ” one long gaze <eos> the goodwife turned on each familiar thing <eos> the lowing kine , the orchard blossoming <eos> the open door that showed the hearth fire 's blaze <eos> and calmly answered , “ yes , he will provide <eos> silent and slow they crossed the homestead 's bound <eos> lingering the longest by their child 's grave mound <eos> “ move on , or stay and hang ! ” the sheriff cried <eos> they left behind them more than home or land <eos> and set sad faces to an alien strand <eos>
outside the dusk , but in the little room <eos> all is alive with light , which brightly glints <eos> on curving cup or the stiff folds of chintz <eos> evoking its own whiteness . shadows loom <eos> bulging and black , upon the walls , where hang <eos> rich coloured plates of beauties that appeal <eos> less to the sense of sight than to the feel <eos> so moistly satin are their breasts . a pang <eos> almost of pain , runs through him when he sees <eos> hanging , a homeless marvel , next to these <eos> the silken breastplate of a mandarin <eos> centuries dead , which he had given her <eos> exquisite miracle , when men could spin <eos> jay 's wing and belly of the kingfisher <eos>
man , earth 's poor shadow ! talks of earth 's decay <eos> but hath it nothing of eternal kin <eos> no majesty that shall not pass away <eos> no soul of greatness springing up within <eos> thought marks without hoar shadows of sublime <eos> pictures of power , which if not doomed to win <eos> eternity , stand laughing at old time <eos> for ages : in the grand ancestral line <eos> of things eternal , mounting to divine <eos> i read magnificence where ages pay <eos> worship like conquered foes to the apennine <eos> because they could not conquer . there sits day <eos> too high for night to come at — mountains shine <eos> outpeering time , too lofty for decay <eos>
friend , whom thy fourscore winters leave more dear <eos> than when life 's roseate summer on thy cheek <eos> burned in the flush of manhood 's manliest year <eos> lonely , how lonely ! is the snowy peak <eos> thy feet have reached , and mine have climbed so near <eos> close on thy footsteps ‘ mid the landscape drear <eos> i stretch my hand thine answering grasp to seek <eos> warm with the love no rippling rhymes can speak <eos> look backward ! from thy lofty height survey <eos> thy years of toil , of peaceful victories won <eos> of dreams made real , largest hopes outrun <eos> look forward ! brighter than earth 's morning ray <eos> streams the pure light of heaven 's unsetting sun <eos> the unclouded dawn of life 's immortal day <eos>

the days pass by , empty of thought and will <eos> his thought grows stagnant at its very springs <eos> with every channel on the world of things <eos> dammed up , and thus , by its long standing still <eos> poisons itself and sickens to decay <eos> all his high love for her , his fair desire <eos> loses its light ; and a dull rancorous fire <eos> burning darkness and bitterness that prey <eos> upon his heart are left . his spirit burns <eos> sometimes with hatred , or the hatred turns <eos> to a fierce lust for her , more cruel than hate <eos> till he is weary wrestling with its force <eos> and evermore she haunts him , early and late <eos> as pitilessly as an old remorse <eos>

fair star of evening , splendour of the west <eos> star of my country !— on the horizon 's brink <eos> thou hangest , stooping , as might seem , to sink <eos> on england 's bosom ; yet well pleased to rest <eos> meanwhile , and be to her a glorious crest <eos> conspicuous to the nations . thou , i think <eos> should'st be my country 's emblem ; and should'st wink <eos> bright star ! with laughter on her banners , drest <eos> in thy fresh beauty . there ! that dusky spot <eos> beneath thee , that is england ; there she lies <eos> blessings be on you both ! one hope , one lot <eos> one life , one glory !— i , with many a fear <eos> for my dear country , many heartfelt sighs <eos> among men who do not love her , linger here <eos>
“ we went , ulysses ! ( such was thy command <eos> through the lone thicket and the desert land <eos> a palace in a woody vale we found <eos> brown with dark forests , and with shades around <eos> a voice celestial echoed through the dome <eos> or nymph or goddess , chanting to the loom <eos> access we sought , nor was access denied <eos> radiant she came : the portals open 'd wide <eos> the goddess mild invites the guests to stay <eos> they blindly follow where she leads the way <eos> i only wait behind of all the train <eos> i waited long , and eyed the doors in vain <eos> the rest are vanish 'd , none repass 'd the gate <eos> and not a man appears to tell their fate <eos>
dark and more dark the shades of evening fell <eos> the wished for point was reached — but at an hour <eos> when little could be gained from that rich dower <eos> of prospect , whereof many thousands tell <eos> yet did the glowing west with marvellous power <eos> salute us ; there stood indian citadel <eos> temple of greece , and minster with its tower <eos> substantially expressed — a place for bell <eos> or clock to toll from ! many a tempting isle <eos> with groves that never were imagined , lay <eos> ‘ mid seas how steadfast ! objects all for the eye <eos> of silent rapture , but we felt the while <eos> we should forget them ; they are of the sky <eos> and from our earthly memory fade away <eos>
before the mountains were brought forth , before <eos> earth and the world were made , then god was god <eos> and god will still be god , when flames shall roar <eos> round earth and heaven dissolving at his nod <eos> and this god is our god , even while his rod <eos> of righteous wrath falls on us smiting sore <eos> and this god is our god for evermore <eos> through life , through death , while clod returns to clod <eos> for though he slay us we will trust in him <eos> we will flock home to him by divers ways <eos> yea , though he slay us we will vaunt his praise <eos> serving and loving with the cherubim <eos> watching and loving with the seraphim <eos> our very selves his praise through endless days <eos>
said he , we now are in a place retired <eos> unknown to man , ( such spots how oft desired <eos> let 's take advantage of the present hour <eos> no joys , but those of love , are in our pow'r <eos> all others see withdrawn ! and no one knows <eos> we even live ; perhaps both friends and foes <eos> believe us in the belly of a whale <eos> allow me , lovely princess , to prevail <eos> bestow your kindness , or , without delay <eos> those charms to mamolin let me convey <eos> yet , why go thither ?— happy you could make <eos> the man , whose constancy no perils shake <eos> what would you more ?— his passion 's ardent grown <eos> and surely you 've enough resistance shown <eos>
the prince return 'd : “ renown 'd in days of yore <eos> has stood our father 's hospitable door <eos> no other roof a stranger should receive <eos> no other hands than ours the welcome give <eos> but in my absence riot fills the place <eos> nor bears the modest queen a stranger 's face <eos> from noiseful revel far remote she flies <eos> but rarely seen , or seen with weeping eyes <eos> no — let eurymachus receive my guest <eos> of nature courteous , and by far the best <eos> he woos the queen with more respectful flame <eos> and emulates her former husband 's fame <eos> with what success , ‘ tis jove 's alone to know <eos> and the hoped nuptials turn to joy or woe <eos>
how many bards gild the lapses of time <eos> a few of them have ever been the food <eos> of my delighted fancy ,— i could brood <eos> over their beauties , earthly , or sublime <eos> and often , when i sit me down to rhyme <eos> these will in throngs before my mind intrude <eos> but no confusion , no disturbance rude <eos> do they occasion ; ‘ tis a pleasing chime <eos> so the unnumber 'd sounds that evening store <eos> the songs of birds — the whisp'ring of the leaves <eos> the voice of waters — the great bell that heaves <eos> with solemn sound ,— and thousand others more <eos> that distance of recognizance bereaves <eos> make pleasing music , and not wild uproar <eos>
already , if my mem'ry do not fail <eos> i 've said , the youth 's estates were put to sale <eos> to pay for feasts the fair to entertain <eos> and what he 'd left was only one domain <eos> a petty farm to which he now retired <eos> ashamed to show where once so much admired <eos> and wretched too , a prey to lorn despair <eos> unable to obtain by splendid care <eos> a beauty he 'd pursued six years and more <eos> and should for ever fervently adore <eos> his want of merit was the cause he thought <eos> that she could never to his wish be brought <eos> while from him not a syllable was heard <eos> against the lovely belle his soul preferred <eos>
meantime the banish 'd polynices roves <eos> ( his thebes abandon 'd ) through the aonian groves <eos> while future realms his wandering thoughts delight <eos> his daily vision , and his dream by night <eos> forbidden thebes appears before his eye <eos> from whence he sees his absent brother fly <eos> with transport views the airy rule his own <eos> and swells on an imaginary throne <eos> fain would he cast a tedious age away <eos> and live out all in one triumphant day <eos> he chides the lazy progress of the sun <eos> and bids the year with swifter motion run <eos> with anxious hopes his craving mind is toss 'd <eos> and all his joys in length of wishes lost <eos>
now surely is the hour come for farewell <eos> now , with the lessened light and darkened days <eos> who now would tread the wild hill 's pathless ways <eos> we found so fair when spring and summer 's spell <eos> made blind our hearts this parting to foretell <eos> yet why , while wan and wintry sunlight stays <eos> on perished gold of autumn fields , delays <eos> your heart to speak , while both our hearts rebel <eos> together we have gathered through the year <eos> all that the year could give us of its best <eos> is it not meet our parting should be here <eos> now in the season drear of death and rest <eos> yet since together we its joys have known <eos> how shall each meet the strange new year alone <eos>

their course had hardly run three other days <eos> when fair aminta , studious still of ways <eos> to have her wish , again to alice came <eos> to give dear cleon notice of her flame <eos> my home , cried she , ‘ tis requisite i leave <eos> to ruin me , your cousin , i perceive <eos> is still resolved , for presents now he sends <eos> but he mistakes , and blindly wealth expends <eos> i 'm clearly not the woman he suspects <eos> see here , what jewels rare to please the sex <eos> nice rubies , diamonds too , but what is more <eos> my portrait i have found among the store <eos> which must have been from memory designed <eos> since only with my husband that you 'll find <eos>
i am afraid , oh i am so afraid <eos> the cold black fear is clutching me to night <eos> as long ago when they would take the light <eos> and leave the little child who would have prayed <eos> frozen and sleepless at the thought of death <eos> my heart that beats too fast will rest too soon <eos> i shall not know if it be night or noon <eos> yet shall i struggle in the dark for breath <eos> will no one fight the terror for my sake <eos> the heavy darkness that no dawn will break <eos> how can they leave me in that dark alone <eos> who loved the joy of light and warmth so much <eos> and thrilled so with the sense of sound and touch <eos> how can they shut me underneath a stone <eos>
thro solid curls of smoke , the bursting fires <eos> climb in tall pyramids above the spires <eos> concentring all the winds ; whose forces , driven <eos> with equal rage from every point of heaven <eos> whirl into conflict , round the scantling pour <eos> the twisting flames and thro the rafters roar <eos> suck up the cinders , send them sailing far <eos> to warn the nations of the raging war <eos> bend high the blazing vortex , swell 'd and curl 'd <eos> careering , brightening o'er the lustred world <eos> absorb the reddening clouds that round them run <eos> lick the pale stars , and mock their absent sun <eos> seas catch the splendor , kindling skies resound <eos> and falling structures shake the smouldering ground <eos>

always we are following a light <eos> always the light recedes ; with groping hands <eos> we stretch toward this glory , while the lands <eos> we journey through are hidden from our sight <eos> dim and mysterious , folded deep in night <eos> we care not , all our utmost need demands <eos> is but the light , the light ! so still it stands <eos> surely our own if we exert our might <eos> fool ! never can'st thou grasp this fleeting gleam <eos> its glowing flame would die if it were caught <eos> its value is that it doth always seem <eos> but just a little farther on . distraught <eos> but lighted ever onward , we are brought <eos> upon our way unknowing , in a dream <eos>

england ! the time is come when thou should'st wean <eos> thy heart from its emasculating food <eos> the truth should now be better understood <eos> old things have been unsettled ; we have seen <eos> fair seed time , better harvest might have been <eos> but for thy trespasses ; and , at this day <eos> if for greece , egypt , india , africa <eos> aught good were destined , thou would'st step between <eos> england ! all nations in this charge agree <eos> but worse , more ignorant in love and hate <eos> far — far more abject , is thine enemy <eos> therefore the wise pray for thee , though the freight <eos> of thy offences be a heavy weight <eos> oh grief that earth 's best hopes rest all with thee <eos>
can i forget the dismal night that gave <eos> my soul 's best part forever to the grave <eos> how silent did his old companions tread <eos> by midnight lamps , the mansions of the dead <eos> through breathing statues , then unheeded things <eos> through rows of warriors , and through walks of kings <eos> what awe did the slow solemn knell inspire <eos> the pealing organ , and the pausing choir <eos> the duties by the lawn robed prelate paid <eos> and the last words , that dust to dust conveyed <eos> while speechless o'er thy closing grave we bend <eos> accept these tears , thou dear departed friend <eos> oh , gone forever ! take this long adieu <eos> and sleep in peace next thy loved montague <eos>

dares he behold the thing he is , what thing <eos> he would become is in his mind its child <eos> astir , demanding birth to light and wing <eos> for battle prompt , by pleasure unbeguiled <eos> so moves he forth in faith , if he has made <eos> his mind god 's temple , dedicate to truth <eos> earth 's nourishing delights , no more gainsaid <eos> he tastes , as doth the bridegroom rich in youth <eos> then knows he love , that beckons and controls <eos> the star of sky upon his footway cast <eos> then match in him who holds his tempters fast <eos> the body 's love and mind 's , whereof the soul 's <eos> then earth her man for woman finds at last <eos> to speed the pair unto her goal of goals <eos>

but more than this what moves me most of all <eos> to leave not all unworded and unsped <eos> the whole heart 's greeting of my thanks unsaid <eos> scarce needs this sign , that from my tongue should fall <eos> his name whom sorrow and reverent love recall <eos> the sign to friends on earth of that dear head <eos> alive , which now long since untimely dead <eos> the wan grey waters covered for a pall <eos> their trustless reaches dense with tangling stems <eos> took never life more taintless of rebuke <eos> more pure and perfect , more serene and kind <eos> than when those clear eyes closed beneath the thames <eos> and made the now more hallowed name of luke <eos> memorial to us of morning left behind <eos>
i see thine image through my tears to night <eos> and yet to day i saw thee smiling . how <eos> refer the cause ?— beloved , is it thou <eos> or i , who makes me sad ? the acolyte <eos> amid the chanted joy and thankful rite <eos> may so fall flat , with pale insensate brow <eos> on the altar stair . i hear thy voice and vow <eos> perplexed , uncertain , since thou art out of sight <eos> as he , in his swooning ears , the choir 's amen <eos> beloved , dost thou love ? or did i see all <eos> the glory as i dreamed , and fainted when <eos> too vehement light dilated my ideal <eos> for my soul 's eyes ? will that light come again <eos> as now these tears come — falling hot and real <eos>

beloved , in the noisy city here <eos> the thought of thee can make all turmoil cease <eos> around my spirit , folds thy spirit clear <eos> its still , soft arms , and circles it with peace <eos> there is no room for any doubt or fear <eos> in souls so overfilled with love 's increase <eos> there is no memory of the bygone year <eos> but growth in heart 's and spirit 's perfect ease <eos> how hath our love , half nebulous at first <eos> rounded itself into a full orbed sun <eos> how have our lives and wills ( as haply erst <eos> they were , ere this forgetfulness begun <eos> through all their earthly distances outburst <eos> and melted , like two rays of light in one <eos>
good kosciusko , thy great name alone <eos> is a full harvest whence to reap high feeling <eos> it comes upon us like the glorious pealing <eos> of the wide spheres — an everlasting tone <eos> and now it tells me , that in worlds unknown <eos> the names of heroes , burst from clouds concealing <eos> and changed to harmonies , for ever stealing <eos> through cloudless blue , and round each silver throne <eos> it tells me too , that on a happy day <eos> when some good spirit walks upon the earth <eos> thy name with alfred 's , and the great of yore <eos> gently commingling , gives tremendous birth <eos> to a loud hymn , that sounds far , far away <eos> to where the great god lives for evermore <eos>

day after day i dreamed there , while my heart <eos> gathered up knowledge in its childish way <eos> making fine pictures with unconscious art <eos> and learning beauty more and more each day <eos> ever and ever haunted i that spot <eos> sitting in dells scooped out between the hills <eos> that rising close around me , formed a grot <eos> fragrant with ferns , and musical with rills <eos> far up above me grew the long armed beech <eos> dropping its branches down in graceful bent <eos> while farther up , beyond my utmost reach <eos> stood dusky hemlocks , crowning the ascent <eos> and all about were sweeter sights and sounds <eos> than elsewhere , but in poet 's dream , abounds <eos>

above the spring tide sundawn of the year <eos> a sunlike star , not born of day or night <eos> filled the fair heaven of spring with heavenlier light <eos> made of all ages orbed in one sole sphere <eos> whose light was as a titan 's smile or tear <eos> then rose a ray more flowerlike , starry white <eos> like a child 's eye grown lovelier with delight <eos> sweet as a child 's heart lightening laugh to hear <eos> and last a fire from heaven , a fiery rain <eos> as of god 's wrath on the unclean cities , fell <eos> and lit the shuddering shades of half seen hell <eos> that shrank before it and were cloven in twain <eos> a beacon fired by lightning , whence all time <eos> sees red the bare black ruins of a crime <eos>

pity refusing my poor love to feed <eos> a beggar starved for want of help he lies <eos> and at your mouth , the door of beauty , cries <eos> that thence some alms of sweet grants might proceed <eos> but as he waiteth for some alm è s deed <eos> a cherry tree before the door he spies <eos> “ o dear , ” quoth he , “ two cherries may suffice <eos> two only may save life in this my need <eos> but beggars , can they nought but cherries eat <eos> pardon my love , he is a goddess ’ son <eos> and never feedeth but on dainty meat <eos> else need he not to pine , as he hath done <eos> for only the sweet fruit of this sweet tree <eos> can give food to my love and life to me <eos>
when i do count the clock that tells the time <eos> and see the brave day sunk in hideous night <eos> when i behold the violet past prime <eos> and sable curls all silvered o'er with white <eos> when lofty trees i see barren of leaves <eos> which erst from heat did canopy the herd <eos> and summer 's green all girded up in sheaves <eos> borne on the bier with white and bristly beard <eos> then of thy beauty do i question make <eos> that thou among the wastes of time must go <eos> since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake <eos> and die as fast as they see others grow <eos> and nothing ‘ gainst time 's scythe can make defence <eos> save breed to brave him , when he takes thee hence <eos>
last night , as now , i seemed to speak with him <eos> or was it but my heart that spoke for him <eos> “ thou mak'st me long , ” i said , “ therefore wilt give <eos> my longing is thy promise , o my god <eos> if , having sinned , i thus have lost the claim <eos> why doth the longing yet remain with me <eos> and make me bold thus to besiege thy doors <eos> methought i heard for answer : “ question on <eos> hold fast thy need ; it is the bond that holds <eos> thy being yet to mine . i give it thee <eos> a hungering and a fainting and a pain <eos> yet a god blessing . thou art not quite dead <eos> while this pain lives in thee . i bless thee with it <eos> better to live in pain than die that death <eos>
vain transitory splendors ! could not all <eos> reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall <eos> obscure it sinks , nor shall it more impart <eos> an hour 's importance to the poor man 's heart <eos> thither no more the peasant shall repair <eos> to sweet oblivion of his daily care <eos> no more the farmer 's news , the barber 's tale <eos> no more the woodman 's ballad shall prevail <eos> no more the smith his dusky brow shall clear <eos> relax his ponderous strength , and lean to hear <eos> the host himself no longer shall be found <eos> careful to see the mantling bliss go round <eos> nor the coy maid , half willing to be pressed <eos> shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest <eos>
are we , then , wholly fallen ? can it be <eos> that thou , north wind , that from thy mountains bringest <eos> their spirit to our plains , and thou , blue sea <eos> who on our rocks thy wreaths of freedom flingest <eos> as on an altar ,— can it be that ye <eos> have wasted inspiration on dead ears <eos> dulled with the too familiar clank of chains <eos> the people 's heart is like a harp for years <eos> hung where some petrifying torrent rains <eos> its slow incrusting spray : the stiffened chords <eos> faint and more faint make answer to the tears <eos> that drip upon them : idle are all words <eos> only a golden plectrum wakes the tone <eos> deep buried ‘ neath that ever thickening stone <eos>
“ not so , eurymachus : that no man draws <eos> the wondrous bow , attend another cause <eos> sacred to phoebus is the solemn day <eos> which thoughtless we in games would waste away <eos> till the next dawn this ill timed strife forego <eos> and here leave fixed the ringlets in a row <eos> now bid the sewer approach , and let us join <eos> in due libations , and in rites divine <eos> so end our night : before the day shall spring <eos> the choicest offerings let melanthius bring <eos> let then to phoebus ’ name the fatted thighs <eos> feed the rich smokes high curling to the skies <eos> so shall the patron of these arts bestow <eos> ( for his the gift ) the skill to bend the bow <eos>
o watcher at the guardless gate of kings <eos> o doorkeeper that serving at their feast <eos> hast in thine hand their doomsday drink , and seest <eos> with eyeless sight the soul of unseen things <eos> thou in whose ear the dumb time coming sings <eos> death , priest and king that makest of king and priest <eos> a name , a dream , a less thing than the least <eos> hover awhile above him with closed wings <eos> till the coiled soul , an evil snake shaped beast <eos> eat its base bodily lair of flesh away <eos> if haply , or ever its cursed life have ceased <eos> or ever thy cold hands cover his head <eos> from sight of france and freedom and broad day <eos> he may see these and wither and be dead <eos>
when thou shalt search thy glass nor find the flower <eos> that there so long smiled gay , unwithering <eos> and from sad vantage of a forlorn hour <eos> that fore nor aft unmasks one hint of spring <eos> thou mourn'st the barrenness of beauty spent <eos> with no reserv è d treasure for the day <eos> when all that youth and sunny fortune lent <eos> no more should light adoring eyes to thee <eos> and fear'st thyself a cold , by the last storm <eos> beat to thine inn , a still , uncarping guest <eos> thy once bright eye a pilot to the worm <eos> making his dungeon way to his new feast <eos> drop not a tear then for thy beauty fled <eos> but for the wounds it healed not bow thy head <eos>
he kept his secret ; but the seed of crime <eos> bursts of itself in god 's appointed time <eos> the lives he wrecked were scattered far and wide <eos> one never blamed nor wept ,— she only died <eos> none knew his lot , though idle tongues would say <eos> he sought a lonely refuge far away <eos> and there , with borrowed name and altered mien <eos> he died unheeded , as he lived unseen <eos> the moral market had the usual chills <eos> of virtue suffering from protested bills <eos> the white cravats , to friendship 's memory true <eos> sighed for the past , surveyed the future too <eos> their sorrow breathed in one expressive line <eos> “ gave pleasant dinners ; who has got his wine <eos>
in robes of tyrian blue the king was drest <eos> a jewelled collar shone upon his breast <eos> a giant ruby glittered in his crown <eos> lord of rich lands and many a splendid town <eos> in him the glories of an ancient line <eos> of sober kings , who ruled by right divine <eos> were centred ; and to him with loyal awe <eos> the people looked for leadership and law <eos> ten thousand knights , the safeguard of the land <eos> lay like a single sword within his hand <eos> a hundred courts , with power of life and death <eos> proclaimed decrees of justice by his breath <eos> and all the sacred growths that men had known <eos> of order and of rule upheld his throne <eos>

a ladder , which my ken pursued in vain <eos> so lofty was the summit ; down whose steps <eos> i saw the splendours in such multitude <eos> descending , ev'ry light in heav'n , methought <eos> was shed thence . as the rooks , at dawn of day <eos> bestirring them to dry their feathers chill <eos> some speed their way a field , and homeward some <eos> returning , cross their flight , while some abide <eos> and wheel around their airy lodge ; so seem 'd <eos> that glitterance , wafted on alternate wing <eos> as upon certain stair it met , and clash 'd <eos> its shining . and one ling'ring near us , wax 'd <eos> so bright , that in my thought : said : “ the love <eos> which this betokens me , admits no doubt <eos>
afar in the desert i love to ride <eos> with the silent bush boy alone by my side <eos> o'er the brown karroo , where the bleating cry <eos> of the springbok 's fawn sounds plaintively <eos> and the timorous quagga 's shrill whistling neigh <eos> is heard by the fountain at twilight gray <eos> where the zebra wantonly tosses his mane <eos> with wild hoof scouring the desolate plain <eos> and the fleet footed ostrich over the waste <eos> speeds like a horseman who travels in haste <eos> hieing away to the home of her rest <eos> where she and her mate have scooped their nest <eos> far hid from the pitiless plunderer 's view <eos> in the pathless depths of the parched karroo <eos>

at length a wedding much attention caught <eos> the lads and lasses of the hamlet sought <eos> to see the couple pass : the belle perceived <eos> the very man for whom her bosom heaved <eos> and loudly cried , behold scamander 's flood <eos> which raised surprise ; soon numbers round her stood <eos> astonishment expressed , but still the fair <eos> whate'er was asked , would nothing more declare <eos> than , in the spacious , blue , ethereal sky <eos> her marriage would be soon , they might rely <eos> a laugh prevailed ; for what was to be done <eos> the god with hasty steps away had run <eos> and none with stones pursued his rapid flight <eos> the deity was quickly ought of sight <eos>
god 's child in christ adopted ,— christ my all <eos> what that earth boasts were not lost cheaply , rather <eos> than forfeit that blest name , by which i call <eos> the holy one , the almighty god , my father <eos> father ! in christ we live , and christ in thee <eos> eternal thou , and everlasting we <eos> the heir of heaven , henceforth i fear not death <eos> in christ i live ! in christ i draw the breath <eos> of the true life !— let then earth , sea , and sky <eos> make war against me ! on my heart i show <eos> their mighty master 's seal . in vain they try <eos> to end my life , that can but end its woe <eos> is that a death bed where a christian lies <eos> yes ! but not his — ‘ tis death itself there dies <eos>
shall a man die before his dying day <eos> death ? and for him though the utter day be nigh <eos> not yet , not yet we give him leave to die <eos> we give him grace not yet that men should say <eos> he is dead , wiped out , perished and past away <eos> till the last bitterness of life go by <eos> thou shalt not slay him ; till those last dregs run dry <eos> o thou last lord of life ! thou shalt not slay <eos> let the lips live a little while and lie <eos> the hand a little , and falter , and fail of strength <eos> and the soul shudder and sicken at the sky <eos> yea , let him live , though god nor man would let <eos> save for the curse ’ sake ; then at bitter length <eos> lord , will we yield him to thee , but not yet <eos>
between us leapt a gold and scarlet flame <eos> into the hollow of the cupped , arched blue <eos> of heaven it rose . its flickering tongues up drew <eos> and vanished in the sunshine . how it came <eos> we guessed not , nor what thing could be its name <eos> from each to each had sprung those sparks which flew <eos> together into fire . but we knew <eos> the winds would slap and quench it in their game <eos> and so we graved and fashioned marble blocks <eos> to treasure it , and placed them round about <eos> with pillared porticos we wreathed the whole <eos> and roofed it with bright bronze . behind carved locks <eos> flowered the tall and sheltered flame . without <eos> the baffled winds thrust at a column 's bole <eos>
shared first with them the bless è d void repose <eos> of oily days at sea , when only rose <eos> the porpoise 's slow wheel to break the sheen <eos> of satin water indolently green <eos> when for'ard the crew , caps tilted over eyes <eos> lay heaped on deck ; slept ; mumbled ; smoked ; threw dice <eos> the sleepy summer days ; the summer nights <eos> ( the coast pricked out with rings of harbour lights <eos> the motionless nights , the vaulted nights of june <eos> when high in the cordage drifts the entangled moon <eos> and blocks go knocking , and the sheets go slapping <eos> and lazy swells against the sides come lapping <eos> and summer mornings off red devon rocks <eos> faint inland bells at dawn and crowing cocks <eos>
the heart you hold too small and local thing <eos> such spacious terms of edifice to bear <eos> and yet , since poesy first shook out her wing <eos> the mighty love has been impalaced there <eos> that has she given him as his wide demesne <eos> and for his sceptre ample empery <eos> against its door to knock has beauty been <eos> content ; it has its purple canopy <eos> a dais for the sovereign lady spread <eos> of many a lover , who the heaven would think <eos> too low an awning for her sacred head <eos> the world , from star to sea , cast down its brink <eos> yet shall that chasm , till he who these did build <eos> an awful curtius make him , yawn unfilled <eos>
no voice is heard , for man has fled the place <eos> but terror crouches in the corners ’ space <eos> and waits the coming guest . this banquet hall <eos> of titans is so high , that he who shall <eos> with wandering eye look up from beam to beam <eos> of the confused wild roof will haply seem <eos> to wonder that the stars he sees not there <eos> giants the spiders are , that weave with care <eos> their hideous webs , which float the joists amid <eos> joists whose dark ends in griffins ’ jaws are hid <eos> the light is lurid , and the air like death <eos> and dark and foul . even night holds its breath <eos> awhile . one might suppose the door had fear <eos> to move its double leaves — their noise to hear <eos>
archbishop turpin , above the rest <eos> spurred his steed to a jutting crest <eos> his sermon thus to the franks he spake <eos> “ lords , we are here for our monarch 's sake <eos> hold we for him , though our death should come <eos> fight for the succor of christendom <eos> the battle approaches — ye know it well <eos> for ye see the ranks of the infidel <eos> cry mea culpa , and lowly kneel <eos> i will assoil you , your souls to heal <eos> in death ye are holy martyrs crowned <eos> the franks alighted , and knelt on ground <eos> in god 's high name the host he blessed <eos> and for penance gave them — to smite their best <eos>
misery , beyond all men 's most miserable <eos> absolute , whole , defiant of defence <eos> inevitable , inexplacable , intense <eos> more vast than heaven is high , more deep than hell <eos> past cure or charm of solace or of spell <eos> possesses and pervades the spirit and sense <eos> whereto the expanse of the earth pays tribute ; whence <eos> breeds evil only , and broods on fumes that swell <eos> rank from the blood of brother and mother and wife <eos> ‘ misery of miseries , all is misery , ’ saith <eos> the heavy fair faced hateful head , at strife <eos> with its own lusts that burn with feverous breath <eos> lips which the loathsome bitterness of life <eos> leaves fearful of the bitterness of death <eos>
how do i love thee ? let me count the ways <eos> i love thee to the depth and breadth and height <eos> my soul can reach , when feeling out of sight <eos> for the ends of being and ideal grace <eos> i love thee to the level of everyday 's <eos> most quiet need , by sun and candlelight <eos> i love thee freely , as men strive for right <eos> i love thee purely , as they turn from praise <eos> i love thee with the passion put to use <eos> in my old griefs , and with my childhood 's faith <eos> i love thee with a love i seemed to lose <eos> with my lost saints ,— i love thee with the breath <eos> smiles , tears , of all my life !— and , if god choose <eos> i shall but love thee better after death <eos>
contending leaders at the word arose <eos> each generous breast with emulation glows <eos> so brave a task each ajax strove to share <eos> bold merion strove , and nestor ’ s valiant heir <eos> the spartan wish ’ d the second place to gain <eos> and great ulysses wish ’ d , nor wish ’ d in vain <eos> then thus the king of men the contest ends <eos> “ thou first of warriors , and thou best of friends <eos> undaunted diomed ! what chief to join <eos> in this great enterprise , is only thine <eos> just be thy choice , without affection made <eos> to birth , or office , no respect be paid <eos> let worth determine here . ” the monarch spake <eos> and inly trembled for his brother ’ s sake <eos>
as the bright flowers start from their wintry tomb <eos> i 've sprung from the depths of futurity 's gloom <eos> with the glory of hope on my unshadowed brow <eos> but a fear at my heart , earth welcomes me now <eos> i come and bear with me a measureless flow <eos> of infinite joy and of infinite woe <eos> the banquet 's light jest and the penitent prayer <eos> the sweet laugh of gladness , the wail of despair <eos> the warm words of welcome , and broken farewell <eos> the strains of rich music , the funeral knell <eos> the fair bridal wreath , and the robe for the dead <eos> o how will they meet in the path i shall tread <eos> o how will they mingle where'er i pass by <eos> as sunshine and storm in the rainbow on high <eos>
unhappy wit , like most mistaken things <eos> atones not for that envy which it brings <eos> in youth alone its empty praise we boast <eos> but soon the short lived vanity is lost <eos> like some fair flower the early spring supplies <eos> that gaily blooms , but even in blooming dies <eos> what is this wit , which must our cares employ <eos> the owner 's wife , that other men enjoy <eos> then most our trouble still when most admired <eos> and still the more we give , the more required <eos> whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease <eos> sure some to vex , but never all to please <eos> ‘ tis what the vicious fear , the virtuous shun <eos> by fools ‘ tis hated , and by knaves undone <eos>
be not displeased that these my papers should <eos> bewray unto the world how fair thou art <eos> or that my wits have showed the best they could <eos> the chastest flame that ever warm è d heart <eos> think not , sweet delia , this shall be thy shame <eos> my muse should sound thy praise with mournful warble <eos> how many live , the glory of whose name <eos> shall rest in ice , while thine is graved in marble <eos> thou mayst in after ages live esteemed <eos> unburied in these lines , reserved in pureness <eos> these shall entomb those eyes , that have redeemed <eos> me from the vulgar , thee from all obscureness <eos> although my careful accents never moved thee <eos> yet count it no disgrace that i loved thee <eos>
in silent horror o'er the boundless waste <eos> the driver hassan with his camels past <eos> one cruise of water on his back he bore <eos> and his light scrip contain 'd a scanty store <eos> a fan of painted feathers in his hand <eos> to guard his shaded face from scorching sand <eos> the sultry sun had gain 'd the middle sky <eos> and not a tree , and not an herb was nigh <eos> the beasts with pain their dusty way pursue <eos> shrill roar 'd the winds , and dreary was the view <eos> with desperate sorrow wild , the affrighted man <eos> thrice sigh 'd , thrice struck his breast , and thus began <eos> ‘ sad was the hour , and luckless was the day <eos> ‘ when first from schiraz ’ walls i bent my way <eos>
if thou survive my well contented day <eos> when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover <eos> and shalt by fortune once more re survey <eos> these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover <eos> compare them with the bett'ring of the time <eos> and though they be outstripped by every pen <eos> reserve them for my love , not for their rhyme <eos> exceeded by the height of happier men <eos> o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought <eos> ‘ had my friend 's muse grown with this growing age <eos> a dearer birth than this his love had brought <eos> to march in ranks of better equipage <eos> but since he died and poets better prove <eos> theirs for their style i 'll read , his for his love <eos>
last , and not least of all these comforts is <eos> the man that 's wedded unto some disease <eos> a peevish , crazy , and a sickly wife <eos> the burthen and the nusance of his life <eos> her bed , the meer resemblance of a tomb <eos> and an apothecarys shop her room <eos> coughing and spitting all the night she lies <eos> a very antidote to marriage joys <eos> yet the poor man must bear with all these ills <eos> besides the excessive charge of physick bills <eos> a nurse , fine cordials , and a hundred things <eos> until his substance she to little brings <eos> till may be she at length resigns to death <eos> the only comfort he cou 'd hope on earth <eos>
what hast thou done , o womanhood of france <eos> mother and daughter , sister , sweetheart , wife <eos> what hast thou done , amid this fateful strife <eos> to prove the pride of thine inheritance <eos> in this fair land of freedom and romance <eos> i hear thy voice with tears and courage rife <eos> smiling against the swords that seek thy life <eos> make answer in a noble utterance <eos> “ i give france all i have , and all she asks <eos> would it were more ! ah , let her ask and take <eos> my hands to nurse her wounded , do her tasks <eos> my feet to run her errands through the dark <eos> my heart to bleed in triumph for her sake <eos> and all my soul to follow thee , jeanne d'arc <eos>
he held no dream worth waking : so he said <eos> he who stands now on death 's triumphal steep <eos> awakened out of life wherein we sleep <eos> and dream of what he knows and sees , being dead <eos> but never death for him was dark or dread <eos> “ look forth ” he bade the soul , and fear not . weep <eos> all ye that trust not in his truth , and keep <eos> vain memory 's vision of a vanished head <eos> as all that lives of all that once was he <eos> save that which lightens from his word : but we <eos> who , seeing the sunset coloured waters roll <eos> yet know the sun subdued not of the sea <eos> nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole <eos> and life and death but shadows of the soul <eos>
thou who didst make and knowest whereof we are made <eos> oh bear in mind our dust and nothingness <eos> our wordless tearless dumbness of distress <eos> bear thou in mind the burden thou hast laid <eos> upon us , and our feebleness unstayed <eos> except thou stay us : for the long long race <eos> which stretches far and far before our face <eos> thou knowest ,— remember thou whereof we are made <eos> if making makes us thine , then thine we are <eos> and if redemption , we are twice thine own <eos> if once thou didst come down from heaven afar <eos> to seek us and to find us , how not save <eos> comfort us , save us , leave us not alone <eos> thou who didst die our death and fill our grave <eos>
the learned teacher satisfaction showed <eos> that such success from his instructions flowed <eos> laughed heartily at husbands , silly wights <eos> who had not wit to guard connubial rights <eos> and from their lamb the wily wolf to keep <eos> a shepherd will o'erlook a hundred sheep <eos> while foolish man 's unable to protect <eos> e'en one where most he 'd wish to be correct <eos> howe'er , this care he thought was somewhat hard <eos> but not a thing impossible to guard <eos> and if he had not got a hundred eyes <eos> thank heav'n , his wife , though cunning to devise <eos> he could defy :— her thoughts so well he knew <eos> that these intrigues she never would pursue <eos>
the heavens beheld the beauty of my queen <eos> and all amazed , to wonder thus began <eos> “ why dotes not jove , as erst we all have seen <eos> and shapes himself like to a seemly man <eos> mean are the matches which he sought before <eos> like bloomless buds , too base to make compare <eos> and she alone hath treasured beauty 's store <eos> in whom all gifts and princely graces are <eos> cupid replied : “ i posted with the sun <eos> to view the maids that liv è d in those days <eos> and none there was that might not well be won <eos> but she , most hard , most cold , made of delays <eos> heavens were deceived , and wrong they do esteem <eos> she hath no heat , although she living seem <eos>
amazed at what the lordly devil said <eos> the clod could naught reply , so great his dread <eos> but at the gasconade perretta smiled <eos> who kept his house and weary hours beguiled <eos> a sprightly clever lass , with prying eye <eos> who , when a shepherdess , could more descry <eos> than sheep or lambs she watched upon the plain <eos> if other views or points she sought to gain <eos> said she , weep not , i 'll undertake at ease <eos> to gull this novice devil as i please <eos> he 's young and ignorant ; has nothing seen <eos> thee ; from his rage , i thoroughly will skreen <eos> my little finger , if i like can show <eos> more malice than his head and body know <eos>
methinks i see thee , lying calm and low <eos> silent and dark within thy earthy bed <eos> thy mighty hands , in which i trusted , dead <eos> resting , with thy long arms , from work or blow <eos> and the night robe , around thy tall form , flow <eos> down from the kingly face , and from the head <eos> save by its thick dark curls , uncovered <eos> my brother , dear from childhood , lying so <eos> not often since thou went'st , i think of thee <eos> ( with inward cares and questionings oppressed <eos> and yet , ere long , i seek thee in thy rest <eos> and bring thee home my heart , as full , as free <eos> as sure that thou wilt take me tenderly <eos> as then when youth and nature made us blest <eos>
when comes the lighted day for men to read <eos> life 's meaning , with the work before their hands <eos> till this good gift of breath from debt is freed <eos> earth will not hear her children 's wailful bands <eos> deplore the chieftain fall'n in sob and dirge <eos> nor they look where is darkness , but on high <eos> the sun that dropped down our horizon 's verge <eos> illumes his labours through the travelled sky <eos> now seen in sum , most glorious ; and ‘ tis known <eos> by what our warrior wrought we hold him fast <eos> a splendid image built of man has flown <eos> his deeds inspired of god outstep a past <eos> ours the great privilege to have had one <eos> among us who celestial tasks has done <eos>
returning from its daily quest , my spirit <eos> changed thoughts and vile in thee doth weep to find <eos> it grieves me that thy mild and gentle mind <eos> those ample virtues which it did inherit <eos> has lost . once thou didst loathe the multitude <eos> of blind and madding men — i then loved thee <eos> i loved thy lofty songs and that sweet mood <eos> when thou wert faithful to thyself and me <eos> i dare not now through thy degraded state <eos> own the delight thy strains inspire — in vain <eos> i seek what once thou wert — we cannot meet <eos> and we were wont . again and yet again <eos> ponder my words : so the false spirit shall fly <eos> and leave to thee thy true integrity <eos>
i must not grieve my love , whose eyes would read <eos> lines of delight , whereon her youth might smile <eos> flowers have a time before they come to seed <eos> and she is young , and now must sport the while <eos> ah sport , sweet maid , in season of these years <eos> and learn to gather flowers before they wither <eos> and where the sweetest blossoms first appears <eos> let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither <eos> lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air <eos> and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise <eos> pity and smiles do best become the fair <eos> pity and smiles shall yield thee lasting praise <eos> make me to say , when all my griefs are gone <eos> happy the heart that sighed for such a one <eos>
to drift with every passion till my soul <eos> is a stringed lute on which all winds can play <eos> is it for this that i have given away <eos> mine ancient wisdom , and austere control <eos> methinks my life is a twice written scroll <eos> scrawled over on some boyish holiday <eos> with idle songs for pipe and virelay <eos> which do but mar the secret of the whole <eos> surely there was a time i might have trod <eos> the sunlit heights , and from life 's dissonance <eos> struck one clear chord to reach the ears of god <eos> is that time dead ? lo ! with a little rod <eos> i did but touch the honey of romance <eos> and must i lose a soul 's inheritance <eos>
think not , because i wonder where you fled <eos> that i would lift a pin to see you there <eos> you may , for me , be prowling anywhere <eos> so long as you show not your little head <eos> no dark and evil story of the dead <eos> would leave you less pernicious or less fair <eos> not even lilith , with her famous hair <eos> and lilith was the devil , i have read <eos> i cannot hate you , for i loved you then <eos> the woods were golden then . there was a road <eos> through beeches ; and i said their smooth feet showed <eos> like yours . truth must have heard me from afar <eos> for i shall never have to learn again <eos> that yours are cloven as no beech 's are <eos>
the woman singeth at her spinning wheel <eos> a pleasant chant , ballad , or baracolle <eos> she thinketh of her song , upon the whole <eos> far more than of her flax ; and yet the reel <eos> is full , and artfully her fingers feel <eos> with quick adjustment , provident control <eos> the lines , too subtly twisted to unroll <eos> out to a perfect thread . i hence appeal <eos> to the dear christian church , that we may do <eos> our father 's business in these temples mirk <eos> thus , swift and steadfast ; thus , intent and strong <eos> while , thus , apart from toil , our souls pursue <eos> some high , calm , spheric tune and prove our work <eos> the better for the sweetness of our song <eos>
the clock chimed three , and we yet strayed at will <eos> about the yard in morning dishabille <eos> when aunt ruth came , with apron o'er her head <eos> holding a letter in her hand , and said <eos> “ here is a note , from vivian i opine <eos> at least his servant brought it . and now , girls <eos> you may think this is no concern of mine <eos> but in my day young ladies did not go <eos> till almost bed time roaming to and fro <eos> in morning wrappers , and with tangled curls <eos> the very pictures of forlorn distress <eos> ‘ tis three o'clock , and time for you to dress <eos> come ! read your note and hurry in , maurine <eos> and make yourself fit object to be seen <eos>
the lone man gazed and gazed upon his gold <eos> his sweat , his blood , the wage of weary days <eos> but now how sweet , how doubly sweet to hold <eos> all gay and gleamy to the campfire blaze <eos> the evening sky was sinister and cold <eos> the willows shivered , wanly lay the snow <eos> the uncommiserating land , so old <eos> so worn , so grey , so niggard in its woe <eos> peered through its ragged shroud . the lone man sighed <eos> poured back the gaudy dust into its poke <eos> gazed at the seething river listless eyed <eos> loaded his corn cob pipe as if to smoke <eos> then crushed with weariness and hardship crept <eos> into his ragged robe , and swiftly slept <eos>
nor deem he lived unto himself alone <eos> his was the public spirit of his sire <eos> and in those eyes , soft with domestic fire <eos> a quenchless light of fiercer temper shone <eos> what time about , the world our shame was blown <eos> on every wind ; his soul would not conspire <eos> with selfish men to soothe the mob 's desire <eos> veiling with garlands moloch 's bloody stone <eos> the high bred instincts of a better day <eos> ruled in his blood , when to be citizen <eos> rang roman yet , and a free people 's sway <eos> was not the exchequer of impoverished men <eos> nor statesmanship with loaded votes to play <eos> nor public office a tramps ’ boosing ken <eos>
yes , childhood , thee no rankling woes pursue <eos> no forms of future ill salute thy view <eos> no pangs repentant bid thee wake to weep <eos> but halcyon peace protects thy downy sleep <eos> and sanguine hope , through every storm of life <eos> shoots her bright beams , and calms the internal strife <eos> yet e'en round childhood 's heart , a thoughtless shrine <eos> affection 's little thread will ever twine <eos> and though but frail may seem each tender tie <eos> the soul foregoes them but with many a sigh <eos> thus , when the long expected moment came <eos> when forced to leave the gentle hearted dame <eos> reluctant throbbings rose within my breast <eos> and a still tear my silent grief express 'd <eos>
he looked half parson and half skipper : a quaint <eos> beautiful blend , with blue eyes good to see <eos> and old world whiskers . you found him cynic , saint <eos> salt , humourist , christian , poet ; with a free <eos> far glancing , luminous utterance ; and a heart <eos> large as st. francis 's : withal a brain <eos> stored with experience , letters , fancy , art <eos> and scored with runes of human joy and pain <eos> till six and sixty years he used his gift <eos> his gift unparalleled , of laughter and tears <eos> and left the world a high piled , golden drift <eos> of verse : to grow more golden with the years <eos> till the great silence fallen upon his ways <eos> break into song , and he that had love have praise <eos>

to all those happy blessings which ye have <eos> with plenteous hand by heaven upon you thrown <eos> this one disparagement they to you gave <eos> that ye your love lent to so meane a one <eos> ye , whose high worths surpassing paragon <eos> could not on earth have found one fit for mate <eos> ne but in heaven matchable to none <eos> why did ye stoup unto so lowly state <eos> but ye thereby much greater glory gate <eos> then had ye sorted with a princes pere <eos> for now your light doth more it selfe dilate <eos> and , in my darknesse , greater doth appeare <eos> yet , since your light hath once enlumind me <eos> with my reflex yours shall encreased be <eos>
the morning road is thronged with merry boys <eos> who seek the water for their sunday joys <eos> they run to seek the shallow pit , and wade <eos> and dance about the water in the shade <eos> the boldest ventures first and dashes in <eos> and others go and follow to the chin <eos> and duck about , and try to lose their fears <eos> and laugh to hear the thunder in their ears <eos> they bundle up the rushes for a boat <eos> and try across the deepest place to float <eos> beneath the willow trees they ride and stoop <eos> the awkward load will scarcely bear them up <eos> without their aid the others float away <eos> and play about the water half the day <eos>
to fly from vice is virtue : to be free <eos> from foolishness is wisdom 's first degree <eos> think of some ill you feel a real disgrace <eos> the loss of money or the loss of place <eos> to keep yourself from these , how keen the strain <eos> how dire the sweat of body and of brain <eos> through tropic heat , o'er rocks and seas you run <eos> to furthest india , poverty to shun <eos> yet scorn the sage who offers you release <eos> from vagrant wishes that disturb your peace <eos> take some provincial pugilist , who gains <eos> a paltry cross way prize for all his pains <eos> place on his brow olympia 's chaplet , earned <eos> without a struggle , would the gift be spurned <eos>
if he be dead , in whom no heart remains <eos> or lifeless be in whom no life is found <eos> if he do pine that never comfort gains <eos> and be distressed that hath his deadly wound <eos> then must i die whose heart elsewhere is clad <eos> and lifeless pass the greedy worms to feed <eos> then must i pine that never comfort had <eos> and be distressed whose wound with tears doth bleed <eos> which if i do , why do i not wax cold <eos> why rest i not like one that wants a heart <eos> why move i still like him that life doth hold <eos> and sense enjoy both of my joy and smart <eos> like niobe queen which made a stone did weep <eos> licia my heart dead and alive doth keep <eos>
he said ; and , straining , heaved him off the ground <eos> with matchless strength ; that time ulysses found <eos> the strength to evade , and where the nerves combine <eos> his ankle struck : the giant fell supine <eos> ulysses , following , on his bosom lies <eos> shouts of applause run rattling through the skies <eos> ajax to lift ulysses next essays <eos> he barely stirr ’ d him , but he could not raise <eos> his knee lock ’ d fast , the foe ’ s attempt denied <eos> and grappling close , they tumbled side by side <eos> defiled with honourable dust they roll <eos> still breathing strife , and unsubdued of soul <eos> again they rage , again to combat rise <eos> when great achilles thus divides the prize <eos>

“ ho ! the warrior that scorneth the foe and fire <eos> hey ó ka will crown with his heart 's desire <eos> he snatched from the embers a red hot brand <eos> and held it aloft in his naked hand <eos> he stood like a statue in bronze or stone <eos> not a muscle moved , and the braves looked on <eos> he turned to the chieftain ,— “ i scorn the fire <eos> ten feathers i wear of the great wanmde é; <eos> then grant me , wak â wa , my heart 's desire <eos> let the sunlight shine in my lonely tee <eos> i laugh at red death and i laugh at red fire <eos> brave red cloud is only afraid of fear <eos> but wiw â st è is fair to his heart and dear <eos> then grant him , wak â wa , his heart 's desire <eos>
i am not one who much or oft delight <eos> to season my fireside with personal talk <eos> about friends , who live within an easy walk <eos> or neighbours , daily , weekly , in my sight <eos> and , for my chance acquaintance , ladies bright <eos> sons , mothers , maidens withering on the stalk <eos> these all wear out of me , like forms , with chalk <eos> painted on rich men 's floors , for one feast night <eos> better than such discourse doth silence long <eos> long , barren silence , square with my desire <eos> to sit without emotion , hope , or aim <eos> by my half kitchen my half parlour fire <eos> and listen to the flapping of the flame <eos> or kettle , whispering it 's faint undersong <eos>
fair isle , that from the fairest of all flowers <eos> thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take <eos> how many memories of what radiant hours <eos> at sight of thee and thine at once awake <eos> how many scenes of what departed bliss <eos> how many thoughts of what entombed hopes <eos> how many visions of a maiden that is <eos> no more — no more upon thy verdant slopes <eos> no more ! alas , that magical sad sound <eos> transfomring all ! thy charms shall please no more <eos> thy memory no more ! accursed ground <eos> henceforth i hold thy flower enamelled shore <eos> o hyacinthine isle ! o purple zante <eos> “ isoa d'oro ! fior di levante <eos>

with how sad steps , o moon ! thou climb'st the skies <eos> how silently , and with how wan a face <eos> what ! may it be , that even in heavenly place <eos> that busy archer his sharp arrows tries <eos> sure , if that long with love acquainted eyes <eos> can judge of love , thou feel'st a lover 's case <eos> i read it in thy looks ; thy languish 'd grace <eos> to me that feel the like , thy state descries <eos> then , even of fellowship , o moon , tell me <eos> is constant love deem 'd there but want of wit <eos> are beauties there as proud as here they be <eos> do they above love to be loved , and yet <eos> those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess <eos> do they call virtue there ungratefulness <eos>
a harry of hoofs in a village street <eos> a shape in the moonlight , a bulk in the dark <eos> and beneath from the pebbles , in passing , a spark <eos> struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet <eos> that was all ! and yet , through the gloom and the light <eos> the fate of a nation was riding that night <eos> and the spark struck out by that steed , in his flight <eos> kindled the land into flame with its heat <eos> he has left the village and mounted the steep <eos> and beneath him , tranquil and broad and deep <eos> is the mystic , meeting the ocean tides <eos> and under the alders , that skirt its edge <eos> now soft on the sand , now loud on the ledge <eos> is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides <eos>

among the taller wood with ivy hung <eos> the old fox plays and dances round her young <eos> she snuffs and barks if any passes bye <eos> and swings her tail and turns prepared to fly <eos> the horseman hurries bye , she bolts to see <eos> and turns agen , from danger never free <eos> if any stands she runs among the poles <eos> and barks and snaps and drives them in the holes <eos> the shepherd sees them and the boy goes bye <eos> and gets a stick and progs the hole to try <eos> they get all still and lie in safety sure <eos> and out again when every thing 's secure <eos> and start and snap at blackbirds bouncing bye <eos> to fight and catch the great white butterfly <eos>
th ’ escorting spirits turn 'd with gentle looks <eos> toward me , and the mantuan spake : “ my son <eos> here torment thou mayst feel , but canst not death <eos> remember thee , remember thee , if i <eos> safe e'en on geryon brought thee : now i come <eos> more near to god , wilt thou not trust me now <eos> of this be sure : though in its womb that flame <eos> a thousand years contain 'd thee , from thy head <eos> no hair should perish . if thou doubt my truth <eos> approach , and with thy hands thy vesture 's hem <eos> stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief <eos> lay now all fear , o lay all fear aside <eos> turn hither , and come onward undismay 'd <eos> i still , though conscience urg 'd ’ no step advanc 'd <eos>
inland , within a hollow vale , i stood <eos> and saw , while sea was calm and air was clear <eos> the coast of france , the coast of france how near <eos> drawn almost into frightful neighbourhood <eos> i shrunk , for verily the barrier flood <eos> was like a lake , or river bright and fair <eos> a span of waters ; yet what power is there <eos> what mightiness for evil and for good <eos> even so doth god protect us if we be <eos> virtuous and wise : winds blow , and waters roll <eos> strength to the brave , and power , and deity <eos> yet in themselves are nothing ! one decree <eos> spake laws to them , and said that by the soul <eos> only the nations shall be great and free <eos>
it hath been heretofore my chance to see <eos> horsemen with martial order shifting camp <eos> to onset sallying , or in muster rang 'd <eos> or in retreat sometimes outstretch 'd for flight <eos> light armed squadrons and fleet foragers <eos> scouring thy plains , arezzo ! have i seen <eos> and clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts <eos> now with the sound of trumpets , now of bells <eos> tabors , or signals made from castled heights <eos> and with inventions multiform , our own <eos> or introduc 'd from foreign land ; but ne'er <eos> to such a strange recorder i beheld <eos> in evolution moving , horse nor foot <eos> nor ship , that tack 'd by sign from land or star <eos>
yet there is peace for man .— yea , there is peace <eos> even in this noisy , this unsettled scene <eos> when from the crowd , and from the city far <eos> haply he may be set ( in his late walk <eos> o'ertaken with deep thought ) beneath the boughs <eos> of honeysuckle , when the sun is gone <eos> and with fix 'd eye , and wistful , he surveys <eos> the solemn shadows of the heavens sail <eos> and thinks the season yet shall come , when time <eos> will waft him to repose , to deep repose <eos> far from the unquietness of life — from noise <eos> and tumult far — beyond the flying clouds <eos> beyond the stars , and all this passing scene <eos> where change shall cease , and time shall be no more <eos>
a dimness of a glory glimmers here <eos> thro ’ veils and distance from the space remote <eos> a faintest far vibration of a note <eos> reaches to us and seems to bring us near <eos> causing our face to glow with braver cheer <eos> making the serried mist to stand afloat <eos> subduing langour with an antidote <eos> and strengthening love almost to cast out fear <eos> till for one moment golden city walls <eos> rise looming on us , golden walls of home <eos> light of our eyes until the darkness falls <eos> then thro ’ the outer darkness burdensome <eos> i hear again the tender voice that calls <eos> ‘ follow me hither , follow , rise , and come <eos>
“ ‘ tis strange what very strong advising <eos> by word of mouth , or advertising <eos> by chalking on walls , or placarding on vans <eos> with fifty other different plans <eos> the very high pressure , in fact , of pressing <eos> it needs to persuade one to purchase a blessing <eos> whether the soothing american syrup <eos> a safety hat , or a safety stirrup <eos> infallible pills for the human frame <eos> or rowland 's o don'thypppheno ( an ominous name <eos> a doudney 's suit which the shape so hits <eos> that it beats all others into fits <eos> a mechi 's razor for beards unshorn <eos> or a ghost of a whisper catching horn <eos>
‘ tis heaven — not man — must charm away the woe <eos> which bursts when nature 's feelings newly flow <eos> yet tenderness and time may rob the tear <eos> of half its bitterness for one so dear <eos> a nation 's gratitude perchance may spread <eos> a thornless pillow for the widowed head <eos> may lighten well her heart 's maternal care <eos> and wean from penury the soldier 's heir <eos> or deem to living war worn valour just <eos> each wounded remnant — albion 's cherished trust <eos> warm his decline with those endearing rays <eos> whose bounteous sunshine yet may gild his days <eos> so shall that country — while he sinks to rest <eos> his hand hath fought for — by his heart be blest <eos>
whilst youth and error led my wandering mind <eos> and set my thoughts in heedless ways to range <eos> all unawares a goddess chaste i find <eos> diana like , to work my sudden change <eos> for her , no sooner had mine eye bewrayed <eos> but with disdain to see me in that place <eos> with fairest hand the sweet unkindest maid <eos> casts water cold disdain upon my face <eos> which turned my sport into a hart 's despair <eos> which still is chased , while i have any breath <eos> by mine own thoughts set on me by my fair <eos> my thoughts like hounds pursue me to my death <eos> those that i fostered of mine own accord <eos> are made by her to murder thus their lord <eos>
therefore myself is that one only thing <eos> i hold to use or waste , to keep or give <eos> my sole possession every day i live <eos> and still mine own despite time 's winnowing <eos> ever mine own , while moons and seasons bring <eos> from crudeness ripeness mellow and sanative <eos> ever mine own , till death shall ply his sieve <eos> and still mine own , when saints break grave and sing <eos> and this myself as king unto my king <eos> i give , to him who gave himself for me <eos> who gives himself to me , and bids me sing <eos> a sweet new song of his redeemed set free <eos> he bids me sing : o death , where is thy sting <eos> and sing : o grave , where is thy victory <eos>
lady , in beauty and in favour rare <eos> of favour , not of due , i favour crave <eos> nature to thee beauty and favour gave <eos> fair then thou art , and favour thou may'st spare <eos> nor when on me bestowed your favours are <eos> less favour in your face you shall not have <eos> if favour then a wounded soul may save <eos> of murder 's guilt , dear lady , then beware <eos> my loss of life a million fold were less <eos> than the least loss should unto you befall <eos> yet grant this gift ; which gift when i possess <eos> both i have life and you no loss at all <eos> for by your favour only i do live <eos> and favour you may well both keep and give <eos>
my heart was heavy , for its trust had been <eos> abused , its kindness answered with foul wrong <eos> so , turning gloomily from my fellow men <eos> one summer sabbath day i strolled among <eos> the green mounds of the village burial place <eos> where , pondering how all human love and hate <eos> find one sad level ; and how , soon or late <eos> wronged and wrongdoer , each with meekened face <eos> and cold hands folded over a still heart <eos> pass the green threshold of our common grave <eos> whither all footsteps tend , whence none depart <eos> awed for myself , and pitying my race <eos> our common sorrow , like a nighty wave <eos> swept all my pride away , and trembling i forgave <eos>
when in the mines of dark and silent thought <eos> sometimes i delve and find strange fancies there <eos> with heavy labour to the surface brought <eos> that lie and mock me in the brighter air <eos> poor ores from starv è d lodes of poverty <eos> unfit for working or to be refined <eos> that in the darkness cheat the miner 's eye <eos> i turn away from that base cave , the mind <eos> yet had i but the power to crush the stone <eos> there are strange metals hid in flakes therein <eos> each flake a spark sole hidden and alone <eos> that only cunning , toilsome chemists win <eos> all this i know , and yet my chemistry <eos> fails and the pregnant treasures useless lie <eos>
no sooner on my vision streaming , smote <eos> the heav'nly influence , which years past , and e'en <eos> in childhood , thrill 'd me , than towards virgil i <eos> turn 'd me to leftward , panting , like a babe <eos> that flees for refuge to his mother 's breast <eos> if aught have terrified or work 'd him woe <eos> and would have cried : “ there is no dram of blood <eos> that doth not quiver in me . the old flame <eos> throws out clear tokens of reviving fire <eos> but virgil had bereav 'd us of himself <eos> virgil , my best lov 'd father ; virgil , he <eos> to whom i gave me up for safety : nor <eos> all , our prime mother lost , avail 'd to save <eos> my undew 'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears <eos>
a light wind , from the open casement , fanned <eos> my brow and helen 's , as we , hand in hand <eos> sat looking out upon the twilight scene <eos> in dreamy silence . helen 's dark blue eyes <eos> like two lost stars that wandered from the skies <eos> some night adown the meteor 's shining track <eos> and always had been grieving to go back <eos> now gazed up , wistfully , at heaven 's dome <eos> and seemed to recognize and long for home <eos> her sweet voice broke the silence : “ wish , maurine <eos> before you speak ! you know the moon is new <eos> and anything you wish for will come true <eos> before it wanes . i do believe the sign <eos> now tell me your wish , and i 'll tell you mine <eos>
the sky overhead with lowering clouds is cast <eos> which anu in his rage above them massed <eos> dark tempests fly above from rimmon 's breath <eos> who hovers o'er them with the gods of death <eos> the wicked seven winds howl wildly round <eos> and crashing cedars falling shake the ground <eos> now tsil lattu her black wings spreads o'er all <eos> dark shrouding all the forest with her pall <eos> and from his steed for safety each dismounts <eos> and o'er their heads now break the ebon founts <eos> but hark ! what is that dreadful roaring noise <eos> the dragons come ! their flaming crests they poise <eos> above , and nearer blaze their eyes of fire <eos> and see ! upon them rush the monsters dire <eos>
“ this circuit , ” said my teacher , “ knots the scourge <eos> for envy , and the cords are therefore drawn <eos> by charity 's correcting hand . the curb <eos> is of a harsher sound , as thou shalt hear <eos> ( if i deem rightly ) , ere thou reach the pass <eos> where pardon sets them free . but fix thine eyes <eos> intently through the air , and thou shalt see <eos> a multitude before thee seated , each <eos> along the shelving grot . ” then more than erst <eos> i op 'd my eyes , before me view 'd , and saw <eos> shadows with garments dark as was the rock <eos> and when we pass 'd a little forth , i heard <eos> a crying , “ blessed mary ! pray for us <eos> michael and peter ! all ye saintly host <eos>
the boy that goes to fodder with surprise <eos> walks oer the gate he opened yesternight <eos> the hedges all have vanished from his eyes <eos> een some tree tops the sheep could reach to bite <eos> the novel scene emboldens new delight <eos> and , though with cautious steps his sports begin <eos> he bolder shuffles the huge hills of snow <eos> till down he drops and plunges to the chin <eos> and struggles much and oft escape to win <eos> then turns and laughs but dare not further go <eos> for deep the grass and bushes lie below <eos> where little birds that soon at eve went in <eos> with heads tucked in their wings now pine for day <eos> and little feel boys oer their heads can stray <eos>
o for my sake do you with fortune chide <eos> the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds <eos> that did not better for my life provide <eos> than public means which public manners breeds <eos> thence comes it that my name receives a brand <eos> and almost thence my nature is subdued <eos> to what it works in , like the dyer 's hand <eos> pity me then , and wish i were renewed <eos> whilst like a willing patient i will drink <eos> potions of eisel ‘ gainst my strong infection <eos> no bitterness that i will bitter think <eos> nor double penance to correct correction <eos> pity me then dear friend , and i assure ye <eos> even that your pity is enough to cure me <eos>
them virgil answer 'd . “ ye suppose perchance <eos> us well acquainted with this place : but here <eos> we , as yourselves , are strangers . not long erst <eos> we came , before you but a little space <eos> by other road so rough and hard , that now <eos> the ’ ascent will seem to us as play . ” the spirits <eos> who from my breathing had perceiv 'd i liv 'd <eos> grew pale with wonder . as the multitude <eos> flock round a herald , sent with olive branch <eos> to hear what news he brings , and in their haste <eos> tread one another down , e'en so at sight <eos> of me those happy spirits were fix 'd , each one <eos> forgetful of its errand , to depart <eos> where cleans 'd from sin , it might be made all fair <eos>
his beat lies knee high through a dust of story <eos> a dust of terror and torture , grief and crime <eos> ghosts that are england 's wonder , and shame , and glory <eos> throng where he walks , an antic of old time <eos> a sense of long immedicable tears <eos> were ever with him , could his ears but heed <eos> the stern hic jacets of our bloodiest years <eos> are for his reading , had he eyes to read <eos> but here , where crookback raged , and cranmer trimmed <eos> and more and strafford faced the axe 's proving <eos> he shows that crown the desperate colonel nimmed <eos> or simply keeps the country cousin moving <eos> or stays such cockney pencillers as would shame <eos> the wall where some dead queen hath traced her name <eos>
now sank the sun to ocean 's fathomless flood <eos> o'er the dim land the infinite darkness stole <eos> wherein men gain a little rest from toil <eos> then by the ships , despite their sorrow , supped <eos> the argives , for ye cannot thrust aside <eos> hunger 's importunate craving , when it comes <eos> upon the breast , but straightway heavy and faint <eos> lithe limbs become ; nor is there remedy <eos> until one satisfy this clamorous guest <eos> therefore these ate the meat of eventide <eos> in grief for achilles ’ hard necessity <eos> constrained them all . and , when they had broken bread <eos> sweet sleep came on them , loosening from their frames <eos> care 's heavy chain , and quickening strength anew <eos>
reader , didst ever see a water spout <eos> ‘ tis possible that thou wilt answer , “ no <eos> well then ! he makes a most infernal rout <eos> sucks , like an elephant , the waves below <eos> with huge proboscis reaching from the sky <eos> as if he meant to drink the ocean dry <eos> at length so full he can n't hold one drop more <eos> he bursts down rush the waters with a roar <eos> on some poor boat , or sloop , or brig , or ship <eos> and almost sinks the wand'rer of the deep <eos> thus have i seen a monarch at reviews <eos> suck from the tribe of officers the news <eos> then bear in triumph off each wondrous matter <eos> and souse it on the queen with such a clatter <eos>
o how i faint when i of you do write <eos> knowing a better spirit doth use your name <eos> and in the praise thereof spends all his might <eos> to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame <eos> but since your worth ( wide as the ocean is <eos> the humble as the proudest sail doth bear <eos> my saucy bark ( inferior far to his <eos> on your broad main doth wilfully appear <eos> your shallowest help will hold me up afloat <eos> whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride <eos> or ( being wrecked ) i am a worthless boat <eos> he of tall building , and of goodly pride <eos> then if he thrive and i be cast away <eos> the worst was this , my love was my decay <eos>
thus is the panther neither loved nor fear 'd <eos> a mere mock queen of a divided herd <eos> whom soon by lawful power she might control <eos> herself a part submitted to the whole <eos> then , as the moon who first receives the light <eos> by which she makes our nether regions bright <eos> so might she shine , reflecting from afar <eos> the rays she borrow 'd from a better star <eos> big with the beams which from her mother flow <eos> and reigning o'er the rising tides below <eos> now , mixing with a savage crowd , she goes <eos> and meanly flatters her inveterate foes <eos> ruled while she rules , and losing every hour <eos> her wretched remnants of precarious power <eos>
bless è d that flock safe penned in paradise <eos> bless è d this flock which tramps in weary ways <eos> all form one flock , god 's flock ; all yield him praise <eos> by joy or pain , still tending toward the prize <eos> joy speaks in praises there , and sings and flies <eos> where no night is , exulting all its days <eos> here , pain finds solace , for , behold , it prays <eos> in both love lives the life that never dies <eos> here life is the beginning of our death <eos> and death the starting point whence life ensues <eos> surely our life is death , our death is life <eos> nor need we lay to heart our peace or strife <eos> but calm in faith and patience breathe the breath <eos> god gave , to take again when he shall choose <eos>
thus saying , hector of the glancing helm <eos> turn 'd to depart ; with rapid step he reach 'd <eos> his own well furnished house , but found not there <eos> his white arm 'd spouse , the fair andromache <eos> she with her infant child and maid the while <eos> was standing , bath 'd in tears , in bitter grief <eos> on ilium 's topmost tower : but when her lord <eos> found not within the house his peerless wife <eos> upon the threshold pausing , thus he spoke <eos> “ tell me , my maidens , tell me true , which way <eos> your mistress went , the fair andromache <eos> or to my sisters , or my brothers ’ wives <eos> or to the temple where the fair hair 'd dames <eos> of troy invoke minerva 's awful name <eos>
the hour for which men hungered and had thirst <eos> and dying were loth to die before it came <eos> is it indeed upon thee ? and the lame <eos> late foot of vengeance on thy trace accurst <eos> for years insepulchred and crimes inhearsed <eos> for days marked red or black with blood or shame <eos> hath it outrun thee to tread out thy name <eos> this scourge , this hour , is this indeed the worst <eos> o clothed and crowned with curses , canst thou tell <eos> have thy dead whispered to thee what they see <eos> whose eyes are open in the dark on thee <eos> ere spotted soul and body take farewell <eos> or what of life beyond the worm 's may be <eos> satiate the immitigable hours in hell <eos>
throughout the echoing chambers of my brain <eos> i hear your words in mournful cadence toll <eos> like some slow passing bell which warns the soul <eos> of sundering darkness . unrelenting , fain <eos> to batter down resistance , fall again <eos> stroke after stroke , insistent diastole <eos> the bitter blows of truth , until the whole <eos> is hammered into fact made strangely plain <eos> where shall i look for comfort ? not to you <eos> our worlds are drawn apart , our spirit 's suns <eos> divided , and the light of mine burnt dim <eos> now in the haunted twilight i must do <eos> your will . i grasp the cup which over runs <eos> and with my trembling lips i touch the rim <eos>
a carver , having loved too long in vain <eos> hewed out the portraiture of venus ’ son <eos> in marble rock , upon the which did rain <eos> small drizzling drops , that from a fount did run <eos> imagining the drops would either wear <eos> his fury out , or quench his living flame <eos> but when he saw it bootless did appear <eos> he swore the water did augment the same <eos> so i , that seek in verse to carve thee out <eos> hoping thy beauty will my flame allay <eos> viewing my verse and poems all throughout <eos> find my will rather to my love obey <eos> that with the carver i my work do blame <eos> finding it still th ’ augmenter of my flame <eos>
methought i saw the footsteps of a throne <eos> which mists and vapours from mine eyes did shroud <eos> nor view of him who sate thereon allow 'd <eos> but all the steps and ground about were strown <eos> with sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone <eos> ever put on ; a miserable crowd <eos> sick , hale , old , young , who cried before that cloud <eos> “ thou art our king , o death ! to thee we groan <eos> i seem 'd to mount those steps ; the vapours gave <eos> smooth way ; and i beheld the face of one <eos> sleeping alone within a mossy cave <eos> with her face up to heaven ; that seem 'd to have <eos> pleasing remembrance of a thought foregone <eos> a lovely beauty in a summer grave <eos>
yea , this is he , whose name is synonym <eos> of all that 's noble , though but lowly born <eos> who took command upon a stormy morn <eos> when few had hope . although uncouth of limb <eos> homely of face and gaunt , but never grim <eos> beautiful he was with that which none may scorn <eos> with love of god and man and things forlorn <eos> and freedom mighty as the soul in him <eos> large at the helm of state he leans and looms <eos> with the grave , kindly look of those who die <eos> doing their duty . stanch , unswervingly <eos> onward he steers beneath portentous glooms <eos> and overwhelming thunders of the sky <eos> till , safe in port , he sees a people free <eos>
then do i love and draw this weary breath <eos> for her , the cruel fair , within whose brow <eos> i written find the sentence of my death <eos> in unkind letters wrote she cares not how <eos> thou power that rul'st the confines of the night <eos> laughter loving goddess , worldly pleasures ’ queen <eos> intenerate that heart that sets so light <eos> the truest love that ever yet was seen <eos> and cause her leave to triumph in this wise <eos> upon the prostrate spoil of that poor heart <eos> that serves , a trophy to her conquering eyes <eos> and must their glory to the world impart <eos> once let her know sh'hath done enough to prove me <eos> and let her pity if she cannot love me <eos>
wrongs , injuries , from many a darksome den <eos> now , gay in hope , explore the paths of men <eos> see from his cavern grim oppression rise <eos> and throw on poverty his cruel eyes <eos> keen on the helpless victim see him fly <eos> and stifle , dark , the feebly bursting cry <eos> mark ruffian violence , distained with crimes <eos> rousing elate in these degenerate times <eos> view unsuspecting innocence a prey <eos> as guileful fraud points out the erring way <eos> while subtle litigation 's pliant tongue <eos> the life blood equal sucks of right and wrong <eos> hark , injur 'd want recounts th ’ unlisten 'd tale <eos> and much wrong 'd mis'ry pours the unpitied wail <eos>
in ida vale three queens the shepherd saw <eos> queens of esteem , divine they were all three <eos> a sight of worth . but i a wonder shaw <eos> their virtues all in one alone to be <eos> licia the fair , surpassing venus ’ pride <eos> ( the matchless queen , commander of the gods <eos> when drawn with doves she in her pomp doth ride <eos> hath far more beauty , and more grace by odds <eos> juno , jove 's wife , unmeet to make compare <eos> i grant a goddess , but not half so mild <eos> minerva wise , a virtue , but not rare <eos> yet these are mean , if that my love but smiled <eos> she them surpasseth , when their prides are full <eos> as far as they surpass the meanest trull <eos>
one might believe that natural miseries <eos> had blasted france , and made of it a land <eos> unfit for men ; and that in one great band <eos> her sons were bursting forth , to dwell at ease <eos> but ‘ tis a chosen soil , where sun and breeze <eos> shed gentle favours : rural works are there <eos> and ordinary business without care <eos> spot rich in all things that can soothe and please <eos> how piteous then that there should be such dearth <eos> of knowledge ; that whole myriads should unite <eos> to work against themselves such fell despite <eos> should come in phrensy and in drunken mirth <eos> impatient to put out the only light <eos> of liberty that yet remains on earth <eos>
sweet wreck of loveliness ! alas , how soon <eos> the sad brief summer of thy joys hath fled <eos> how sorrow 's friendship for thy hapless doom <eos> thy beauty faded , and thy hopes all dead <eos> oh ! ‘ twas that beauty 's pow'r which first destroy 'd <eos> thy mind 's serenity ; its charms but led <eos> the faithless friend , that thy pure love enjoy 'd <eos> to tear the blooming blossom from its bed <eos> how reason shudders at thy frenzied air <eos> to see thee smile , with fancy 's dreams possess 'd <eos> or shrink , the frozen image of despair <eos> or love enraptur 'd , chaunt thy griefs to rest <eos> oh ! cease that mournful voice , poor suff'ring child <eos> my heart but bleeds to hear thy musings wild <eos>
“ not all ” — the echoes answer me — “ not all <eos> prophetic sounds and loud , arise forever <eos> from us , and from all ruin , unto the wise <eos> as melody from memnon to the sun <eos> we rule the hearts of mightiest men — we rule <eos> with a despotic sway all giant minds <eos> we are not impotent — we pallid stones <eos> not all our power is gone — not all our fame <eos> not all the magic of our high renown <eos> not all the wonder that encircles us <eos> not all the mysteries that in us lie <eos> not all the memories that hang upon <eos> and cling around about us as a garment <eos> clothing us in a robe of more than glory <eos>
tell me , when shall these wearie woes have end <eos> or shall their ruthlesse torment never cease <eos> but al my days in pining languor spend <eos> without hope of asswagement or release <eos> is there no meanes for me to purchace peace <eos> or make agreement with her thrilling eyes <eos> but that their cruelty doth still increace <eos> and dayly more augment my miseryes <eos> but when ye have shew 'd all extremityes <eos> then think how little glory ye have gayned <eos> by slaying him , whose lyfe , though ye despyse <eos> mote have your life in honor long maintayned <eos> but by his death , which some perhaps will mone <eos> ye shall condemned be of many a one <eos>
we feel and see with different hearts and eyes <eos> ah christ , if all our hearts could meet in thee <eos> how well it were for them and well for me <eos> our hearts thy dear accepted sacrifice <eos> thou , only life of hearts and light of eyes <eos> our life , our light , if once we turn to thee <eos> so be it , o lord , to them and so to me <eos> be all alike thine own dear sacrifice <eos> thou who by death hast ransomed us from death <eos> thyself god 's sole well pleasing sacrifice <eos> thine only sacred self i plead with thee <eos> make thou it well for them and well for me <eos> that thou hast given us souls and wills and breath <eos> and hearts to love thee ; and to see thee , eyes <eos>
i had no thought of violets of late <eos> the wild , shy kind that spring beneath your feet <eos> in wistful april days , when lovers mate <eos> and wander through the fields in raptures sweet <eos> the thought of violets meant florists ’ shops <eos> and bows and pins , and perfumed papers fine <eos> and garish lights , and mincing little fops <eos> and cabarets and songs , and deadening wine <eos> so far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed <eos> i had forgot wide fields , and clear brown streams <eos> the perfect loveliness that god has made <eos> wild violets shy and heaven mounting dreams <eos> and now — unwittingly , you 've made me dream <eos> of violets , and my soul 's forgotten gleam <eos>
the trito born , the passing wise , beheld <eos> and pitied him , and showered upon his head <eos> ambrosia , which hath virtue aye to keep <eos> taintless , men say , the flesh of warriors slain <eos> like softly breathing sleeper dewy fresh <eos> she made him : over that dead face she drew <eos> a stern frown , even as when he lay , with wrath <eos> darkening his grim face , clasping his slain friend <eos> patroclus ; and she made his frame to be <eos> more massive , like a war god to behold <eos> and wonder seized the argives , as they thronged <eos> and saw the image of a living man <eos> where all the stately length of peleus ’ son <eos> lay on the couch , and seemed as though he slept <eos>
shot up from broad rank blades that droop below <eos> the nodding wheat ear forms a graceful bow <eos> with milky kernels starting full , weigh 'd down <eos> ere yet the sun hath ting 'd its head with brown <eos> whilst thousands in a flock , for ever gay <eos> loud chirping sparrows welcome on the day <eos> and from the mazes of the leafy thorn <eos> drop one by one upon the bending corn <eos> giles with a pole assails their close retreats <eos> and round the grass grown dewy border beats <eos> on either side completely overspread <eos> here branches bend , there corn o'ertops his head <eos> green covert , hail ! for through the varying year <eos> no hours so sweet , no scene to him so dear <eos>
those who have tact their poverty to mask <eos> before their chief get more than those who ask <eos> it makes , you see , a difference , if you take <eos> as modest people do , or snatch your cake <eos> yet that 's the point from which our question starts <eos> by what way best to get at patrons ’ hearts <eos> “ my mother 's poor , my sister 's dower is due <eos> my farm wo n't sell or yield us corn enow <eos> what is all this but just the beggar 's cry <eos> “ i 'm starving ; give me food for charity <eos> “ ah ! ” whines another in a minor key <eos> “ the loaf 's in out ; pray spare a slice for me <eos> but if in peace the raven would have fed <eos> he 'd have had less of clawing , more of bread <eos>
ah , was it yrma with those radiant eyes <eos> that came to greet and lead him through the skies <eos> ay ; all the world was one wide rose white flame <eos> as down the path to meet him yrma came <eos> and caught the child up in her arms and cried <eos> this is my child that moved in etain 's side <eos> thy child and etain 's : i the unknown ideal <eos> and she the rich , the incarnate , breathing real <eos> are one ; for me thou never canst attain <eos> but by the love i yield thee for etain <eos> even as through christ thy soul allays its dearth <eos> love 's heaven is only compassed upon earth <eos> and by that love , in thine own etain 's eyes <eos> thou shalt find all god 's untranscended skies <eos>
i know the sorrows of the last abyss <eos> i walked the cold black pools without a star <eos> i lay on rock of unseen flint and spar <eos> i heard the execrable serpent hiss <eos> i dreamed of sun , fruit tree , and virgin 's kiss <eos> i woke alone with midnight near and far <eos> and everlasting hunger , keen to mar <eos> but i arose , and my reward is this <eos> i am no more one more amid the throng <eos> though name be naught , and lips forever weak <eos> i seem to know at last of mighty song <eos> and with no blush , no tremor on the cheek <eos> i do claim consort with the great and strong <eos> who suffered ill and had the gift to speak <eos>
hail , twilight , sovereign of one peaceful hour <eos> not dull art thou as undiscerning night <eos> but studious only to remove from sight <eos> day 's mutable distinctions .— ancient power <eos> thus did the waters gleam , the mountains lower <eos> to the rude briton , when , in wolf skin vest <eos> here roving wild , he laid him down to rest <eos> on the bare rock , or through a leafy bower <eos> looked ere his eyes were closed . by him was seen <eos> the self same vision which we now behold <eos> at thy meek bidding , shadowy power ! brought forth <eos> these mighty barriers , and the gulf between <eos> the flood , the stars ,— a spectacle as old <eos> as the beginning of the heavens and earth <eos>
how into worthless lead pure gold is changed <eos> who is that priest slain in the holy place <eos> weep , weep jerusalem , perfidious city <eos> wretched destroyer of the sacred seers <eos> god of his love for thee divests himself <eos> thy incense in his eyes is incense foul <eos> where do you take those children and those wives <eos> the queen of cities god has overthrown <eos> her priests are captives , and her kings disowned <eos> temple be overthrown ! cedars cast your flames <eos> jerusalem , thou object of my grief <eos> who in one day has ravished all thy charms <eos> o who will change , to weep thy miseries <eos> mine eyes to two fountains of tears <eos>
as when above orchestral undertone <eos> the plaining wail of muted violin <eos> the hushed ob ö e and the distant din <eos> of muffled drum or viol 's raucous groan <eos> sudden arises one pure voice like tone <eos> a silver trumpet 's tongue that stirs the soul <eos> to feel the theme , and the harmonious whole <eos> a sonant setting seems for that alone <eos> so , high above earth 's murmurous stir and strife <eos> riseth thy voice in clear enringing song <eos> no minor plaint of dull despairing pain <eos> but one true note of hope that bids us long <eos> for higher things ; and all the din of life <eos> seems to subserve the sweetness of thy strain <eos>
so drives self love , through just and through unjust <eos> to one man 's power , ambition , lucre , lust <eos> the same self love , in all , becomes the cause <eos> of what restrains him , government and laws <eos> for , what one likes , if others like as well <eos> what serves one will , when many wills rebel <eos> how shall he keep what , sleeping or awake <eos> a weaker may surprise , a stronger take <eos> his safety must his liberty restrain <eos> all join to guard what each desires to gain <eos> forced into virtue thus by self defence <eos> even kings learn 'd justice and benevolence <eos> self love forsook the path it first pursued <eos> and found the private in the public good <eos>
penelope , for her ulisses sake <eos> deviz 'd a web her wooers to deceave <eos> in which the worke that she all day did make <eos> the same at night she did againe unreave <eos> such subtile craft my damzell doth conceave <eos> th'importune suit of my desire to shonne <eos> for all that i in many dayes do weave <eos> in one short houre i find by her undonne <eos> so when i thinke to end that i begonne <eos> i must begin and never bring to end <eos> for with one looke she spils that long i sponne <eos> and with one word my whole years work doth rend <eos> such labour like the spyders web i fynd <eos> whose fruitlesse worke is broken with least wynd <eos>
that time of year thou mayst in me behold <eos> when yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang <eos> upon those boughs which shake against the cold <eos> bare ruined choirs , where late the sweet birds sang <eos> in me thou seest the twilight of such day <eos> as after sunset fadeth in the west <eos> which by and by black night doth take away <eos> death 's second self that seals up all in rest <eos> in me thou seest the glowing of such fire <eos> that on the ashes of his youth doth lie <eos> as the death bed , whereon it must expire <eos> consumed with that which it was nourished by <eos> this thou perceiv'st , which makes thy love more strong <eos> to love that well , which thou must leave ere long <eos>
ii . and in these lines my purpose is to show <eos> that he who left the father , though he came <eos> not with art splendour or the earthly flame <eos> of genius , yet in that he did bestow <eos> his own true loving heart , did cause to grow <eos> unseen and buried deep , whate'er we name <eos> the best in human art , without the shame <eos> of idle sitting in most real woe <eos> and that whate'er of beautiful and grand <eos> the earth contains , by him was not despised <eos> but rather was so deeply realized <eos> in word and deed , though not with artist hand <eos> that it was either hid or all disguised <eos> from those who were not wise to understand <eos>
there was a day when death to me meant tears <eos> and tearful takings leave that had to be <eos> and awed embarkings on an unshored sea <eos> and sudden disarrangement of the years <eos> but now i know that nothing interferes <eos> with the fixed forces when a tired man dies <eos> that death is only answerings and replies <eos> the chiming of a bell which no one hears <eos> the casual slanting of a half spent sun <eos> the soft recessional of noise and coil <eos> the coveted something time nor age can spoil <eos> i know it is a fabric finely spun <eos> between the stars and dark ; to seize and keep <eos> such glad romances as we read in sleep <eos>

now rose aurora from tithonus ’ bed <eos> to mortals and immortals bringing light <eos> when to the ships of greece came discord down <eos> despatch 'd from jove , with dire portents of war <eos> upon ulysses ’ lofty ship she stood <eos> the midmost , thence to shout to either side <eos> or to the tents of ajax telamon <eos> or of achilles , who at each extreme <eos> confiding in their strength , had moor 'd their ships <eos> there stood the goddess , and in accents loud <eos> and dread she call 'd , and fix 'd in ev'ry breast <eos> the fierce resolve to wage unwearied war <eos> and dearer to their hearts than thoughts of home <eos> or wish 'd return , became the battle field <eos>

the more i 've viewed this world the more i 've found <eos> that , filled as ‘ tis with scenes and creatures rare <eos> fancy commands within her own bright round <eos> a world of scenes and creatures far more fair <eos> nor is it that her power can call up there <eos> a single charm , that 's not from nature won <eos> no more than rainbows in their pride can wear <eos> a single hue unborrowed from the sun <eos> but ‘ tis the mental medium it shines thro <eos> that lends to beauty all its charm and hue <eos> as the same light that o'er the level lake <eos> one dull monotony of lustre flings <eos> will , entering in the rounded raindrop , make <eos> colors as gay as those on peris ’ wings <eos>
o world , thou choosest not the better part <eos> it is not wisdom to be only wise <eos> and on the inward vision close the eyes <eos> but it is wisdom to believe the heart <eos> columbus found a world , and had no chart <eos> save one that faith deciphered in the skies <eos> to trust the soul 's invincible surmise <eos> was all his science and his only art <eos> our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine <eos> that lights the pathway but one step ahead <eos> across a void of mystery and dread <eos> bid , then , the tender light of faith to shine <eos> by which alone the mortal heart is led <eos> unto the thinking of the thought divine <eos>
like as the lute delights or else dislikes <eos> as is his art that plays upon the same <eos> so sounds my muse according as she strikes <eos> on my heart strings high tuned unto her fame <eos> her touch doth cause the warble of the sound <eos> which here i yield in lamentable wise <eos> a wailing descant on the sweetest ground <eos> whose due reports give honour to her eyes <eos> else harsh my style , untunable my muse <eos> hoarse sounds the voice that praiseth not her name <eos> if any pleasing relish here i use <eos> then judge the world her beauty gives the same <eos> for no ground else could make the music such <eos> nor other hand could give so sweet a touch <eos>
beholding youth and hope in mockery caught <eos> from life ; and mocking pulses that remain <eos> when the soul 's death of bodily death is fain <eos> honour unknown , and honour known unsought <eos> and penury 's sedulous self torturing thought <eos> on gold , whose master therewith buys his bane <eos> and longed for woman longing all in vain <eos> for lonely man with love 's desire distraught <eos> and wealth , and strength , and power , and pleasantness <eos> given unto bodies of whose souls men say <eos> none poor and weak , slavish and foul , as they <eos> beholding these things , i behold no less <eos> the blushing morn and blushing eve confess <eos> the shame that loads the intolerable day <eos>
even as upon a low and cloud domed day <eos> when clouds are one cloud till the horizon <eos> our thinking senses deem the sun away <eos> and say «’ tis sunless » and « there is no sun <eos> and yet the very day they wrong truth by <eos> is of the unseen sun ’ s effluent essence <eos> the very words do give themselves the lie <eos> the very thought of absence comes from presence <eos> even so deem we through good of what is evil <eos> he speaks of light that speaks of absent light <eos> and absent god , becoming present devil <eos> is still the absent god by essence ’ right <eos> the withdrawn cause by being withdrawn doth get <eos> ( being thereby cause still ) the denied effect <eos>

light feet , dark violet eyes , and parted hair <eos> soft dimpled hands , white neck , and creamy breast <eos> are things on which the dazzled senses rest <eos> till the fond , fixed eyes , forget they stare <eos> from such fine pictures , heavens ! i cannot dare <eos> to turn my admiration , though unpossess 'd <eos> they be of what is worthy ,— though not drest <eos> in lovely modesty , and virtues rare <eos> yet these i leave as thoughtless as a lark <eos> these lures i straight forget ,— e'en ere i dine <eos> or thrice my palate moisten : but when i mark <eos> such charms with mild intelligences shine <eos> my ear is open like a greedy shark <eos> to catch the tunings of a voice divine <eos>

‘ to all and singular , ’ as dryden says <eos> we bring a fancy of those georgian days <eos> whose style still breathed a faint and fine perfume <eos> of old world courtliness and old world bloom <eos> when speech was elegant and talk was fit <eos> for slang had not been canonised as wit <eos> when manners reigned , when breeding had the wall <eos> and women — yes !— were ladies first of all <eos> when grace was conscious of its gracefulness <eos> and man — though man !— was not ashamed to dress <eos> a brave formality , a measured ease <eos> were his — and hers — whose effort was to please <eos> and to excel in pleasing was to reign <eos> and , if you sighed , never to sigh in vain <eos>

yes , fled already is thy vital fire <eos> and the fair promise of thy early bloom <eos> lost , in youth 's morn extinct ; sunk in the tomb <eos> mute in the grave sleeps thy enchanted lyre <eos> and is it vainly that our souls aspire <eos> falsely does the presaging heart presume <eos> that we shall live beyond life 's cares and gloom <eos> grasps it eternity with high desire <eos> but to imagine bliss , feel woe , and die <eos> leaving survivors to worse pangs than death <eos> not such the sanction of the eternal mind <eos> the harmonious order of the starry sky <eos> and awful revelation 's angel breath <eos> assure these hopes their full effect shall find <eos>
lord ! when you have enough , what need you care <eos> how merrily soever others fare <eos> though all the day i give and take delight <eos> doubt not , sufficient will be left at night <eos> ‘ tis but a just and rational desire <eos> to light a taper at a neighbour 's fire <eos> there 's danger too , you think , in rich array <eos> and none can long be modest that are gay <eos> the cat , if you but singe her tabby skin <eos> the chimney keeps , and sits content within <eos> but once grown sleek , will from her corner run <eos> sport with her tail , and wanton in the sun <eos> she licks her fair round face , and frisks abroad <eos> to show her fur , and to be catterwaw 'd <eos>
common are cooks , professed , plain alike <eos> and common , youths their sustenance who feed on <eos> common ( i 'm told ) a breach of promise suit <eos> and common , damages , in courts agreed on <eos> common are briefs as blackberries ; and fees <eos> are common quite as “ leather and prunella <eos> common are “ unprotected ” witnesses <eos> ( “ credat ” — as horace somewhere sings — “ apella <eos> but most uncommon seems a lowly cook <eos> who with sincerity can kiss the book <eos> and swear ( to shame her betters !) ne'er she took <eos> by sad “ mistake or otherwise , ” by hook <eos> or , as will eventuate , by crook <eos> be it silk or gingham — any one 's umbrella <eos>

the frugal snail , with forecast of repose <eos> carries his house with him where'er he goes <eos> peeps out ,— and if there comes a shower of rain <eos> retreats to his small domicile amain <eos> touch but a tip of him , a horn ,— ‘ tis well <eos> he curls up in his sanctuary shell <eos> he 's his own landlord , his own tenant ; stay <eos> long as he will , he dreads no quarter day <eos> himself he boards and lodges ; both invites <eos> and feasts himself ; sleeps with himself o ’ nights <eos> he spares the upholsterer trouble to procure <eos> chattels ; himself is his own furniture <eos> and his sole riches . whereso'er he roam <eos> knock when you will ,— he 's sure to be at home <eos>
mysterious night ! when our first parent knew <eos> thee from report divine , and heard thy name <eos> did he not tremble for this lovely frame <eos> this glorious canopy of light and blue <eos> yet ‘ neath the curtain of translucent dew <eos> bathed in the rays of the great setting flame <eos> hesperus with the host of heaven came <eos> and lo ! creation widened on man 's view <eos> who could have thought such darkness lay concealed <eos> within thy beams , o sun ! or who could find <eos> while fly , and leaf , and insect stood revealed <eos> that to such countless orbs thou mad'st us blind <eos> why do we , then , shun death with anxious strife <eos> if light can thus deceive , wherefore not life <eos>
stern diomed with either ajax stood <eos> and great ulysses , bathed in hostile blood <eos> embodied close , the labouring grecian train <eos> the fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain <eos> unmoved and silent , the whole war they wait <eos> serenely dreadful , and as fix ’ d as fate <eos> so when the embattled clouds in dark array <eos> along the skies their gloomy lines display <eos> when now the north his boisterous rage has spent <eos> and peaceful sleeps the liquid element <eos> the low hung vapours , motionless and still <eos> rest on the summits of the shaded hill <eos> till the mass scatters as the winds arise <eos> dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies <eos>
you sacred sea nymphs pleasantly disporting <eos> amidst this wat'ry world , where now i sail <eos> if ever love , or lovers sad reporting <eos> had power sweet tears from your fair eyes to hail <eos> and you , more gentle hearted than the rest <eos> under the northern noon stead sweetly streaming <eos> lend those moist riches of your crystal crest <eos> to quench the flames from my heart 's æ tna streaming <eos> and thou , kind triton , in thy trumpet relish <eos> the ruthful accents of my discontent <eos> that midst this travel desolate and hellish <eos> some gentle wind that listens my lament <eos> may prattle in the north in phillis ’ ears <eos> “ where phillis wants , damon consumes in tears <eos>
that time , fair licia , when i stole a kiss <eos> from off those lips , where cupid lovely laid <eos> i quaked for cold , and found the cause was this <eos> my life which loved , for love behind me staid <eos> i sent my heart my life for to recall <eos> but that was held , not able to return <eos> and both detained as captives were in thrall <eos> and judged by her , that both by sighs should burn <eos> fair , burn them both , for that they were so bold <eos> but let the altar be within thy heart <eos> and i shall live because my life you hold <eos> you that give life , to every living part <eos> a flame i took whenas i stole the kiss <eos> take you my life , yet can i live with this <eos>

be wise as thou art cruel , do not press <eos> my tongue tied patience with too much disdain <eos> lest sorrow lend me words and words express <eos> the manner of my pity wanting pain <eos> if i might teach thee wit better it were <eos> though not to love , yet love to tell me so <eos> as testy sick men when their deaths be near <eos> no news but health from their physicians know <eos> for if i should despair i should grow mad <eos> and in my madness might speak ill of thee <eos> now this ill wresting world is grown so bad <eos> mad slanderers by mad ears believed be <eos> that i may not be so , nor thou belied <eos> bear thine eyes straight , though thy proud heart go wide <eos>
the everlasting grass — how bright , how cool <eos> the day has gone too suddenly , too soon <eos> there 's something white and shiny in that pool <eos> throw in a stone , and you will hit the moon <eos> listen , the church bell ringing ! do not say <eos> we must go back to morrow to our work <eos> we 'll tell them we are dead : we died to day <eos> we 're lazy . we 're too happy . we will shirk <eos> we 're cows . we 're kettles . we 'll be anything <eos> except the manikins of time and fear <eos> we 'll start away to morrow wandering <eos> and nobody will notice in a year <eos> now the great sun is slipping under ground <eos> grip firmly !— how the earth is whirling round <eos>
most happy letters ! fram 'd by skilfull trade <eos> with which that happy name was first desynd <eos> the which three times thrise happy hath me made <eos> with guifts of body , fortune , and of mind <eos> the first ray being to me gave by kind <eos> from mothers womb deriv 'd by dew descent <eos> the second is my sovereigne queene most kind <eos> that honour and large richesse to me lent <eos> the third my love , my lives last ornament <eos> by whom my spirit out of dust was raysed <eos> to speake her prayse and glory excellent <eos> of all alive most worthy to be praysed <eos> ye three elizabeths ! for ever live <eos> that three such graces did unto me give <eos>
i saw , sweet licia , when the spider ran <eos> within your house to weave a worthless web <eos> you present were and feared her with your fan <eos> so that amaz è d speedily she fled <eos> she in your house such sweet perfumes did smell <eos> and heard the muses with their notes refined <eos> thus filled with envy , could no longer dwell <eos> but straight returned and at your house repined <eos> then tell me , spider , why of late i saw <eos> thee lose thy poison , and thy bowels gone <eos> did these enchant and keep thy limbs in awe <eos> and made thy forces to be small or none <eos> no , no , thou didst by chance my licia see <eos> who for her look minerva seemed to thee <eos>
if wrongfully i moan 'd thy ‘ pretty wrongs <eos> when i was ‘ sometime absent from thy heart <eos> o none so trusting but to him belongs <eos> some moody moment of his mortal part <eos> no man doth nature make whose trust doth ever <eos> unveering with all winds point still the same <eos> none is so whole in health he knows no fever <eos> to shake the firm composure of his frame <eos> my love so wholly thine , thy worth so dear <eos> made each thine absence so distract my breast <eos> that in his turmoil faith sometime to fear <eos> converted , doubting most when most ‘ twas blest <eos> because mine own heart lone without thee seem 'd <eos> me absent from thy heart i falsely deem 'd <eos>
the young queen nature , ever sweet and fair <eos> once on a time fell upon evil days <eos> from hearing oft herself discussed with praise <eos> there grew within her heart the longing rare <eos> to see herself ; and every passing air <eos> the warm desire fanned into lusty blaze <eos> full oft she sought this end by devious ways <eos> but sought in vain , so fell she in despair <eos> for none within her train nor by her side <eos> could solve the task or give the envied boon <eos> so day and night , beneath the sun and moon <eos> she wandered to and fro unsatisfied <eos> till art came by , a blithe inventive elf <eos> and made a glass wherein she saw herself <eos>
the little love god lying once asleep <eos> laid by his side his heart inflaming brand <eos> whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep <eos> came tripping by , but in her maiden hand <eos> the fairest votary took up that fire <eos> which many legions of true hearts had warmed <eos> and so the general of hot desire <eos> was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed <eos> this brand she quenched in a cool well by <eos> which from love 's fire took heat perpetual <eos> growing a bath and healthful remedy <eos> for men discased , but i my mistress ’ thrall <eos> came there for cure and this by that i prove <eos> love 's fire heats water , water cools not love <eos>
it was a land of plenty and of wealth <eos> there god 's indulgent hand made for a race <eos> supremely blest a paradise on earth <eos> a land of virtue , truth , and charity <eos> where nature 's choicest treasures man enjoyed <eos> with little toil , where youth respected age <eos> where each his neighbour 's wife his sister deemed <eos> where side by side the tiger and the lamb <eos> the water drank , and sported oft in mirth <eos> a land where each man deemed him highly blest <eos> when he relieved the miseries of the poor <eos> when to his roof the wearied traveller came <eos> to share his proffered bounty with good cheer <eos> such was the far famed land of panchala <eos>
when our two souls stand up erect and strong <eos> face to face , silent , drawing nigh and nigher <eos> until the lengthening wings break into fire <eos> at either curved point ,— what bitter wrong <eos> can the earth do to us , that we should not long <eos> be here contented ? think ! in mounting higher <eos> the angels would press on us and aspire <eos> to drop some golden orb of perfect song <eos> into our deep , dear silence . let us stay <eos> rather on earth , beloved ,— where the unfit <eos> contrarious moods of men recoil away <eos> and isolate pure spirits , and permit <eos> a place to stand and love in for a day <eos> with darkness and the death hour rounding it <eos>
what ancient times , those times we fancy wise <eos> have left on long record of woman 's rise <eos> what morals teach it , and what fables hide <eos> what author wrote it , how that author died <eos> all these i sing . in greece they framed the tale <eos> ( in greece , ‘ twas thought a woman might be frail <eos> ye modern beauties ! where the poet drew <eos> his softest pencil , think he dreamt of you <eos> and warn 'd by him , ye wanton pens , beware <eos> how heaven 's concern 'd to vindicate the fair <eos> the case was hesiod 's ; he the fable writ <eos> some think with meaning — some , with idle wit <eos> perhaps ‘ tis either , as the ladies please <eos> i waive the contest , and commence the lays <eos>
live blindly and upon the hour . the lord <eos> who was the future , died full long ago <eos> knowledge which is the past is folly . go <eos> poor child , and be not to thyself abhorred <eos> around thine earth sun winged winds do blow <eos> and planets roll ; a meteor draws his sword <eos> the rainbow breaks his seven coloured chord <eos> and the long strips of river silver flow <eos> awake ! give thyself to the lovely hours <eos> drinking their lips , catch thou the dream in flight <eos> about their fragile hairs ’ aerial gold <eos> thou art divine , thou livest , — as of old <eos> apollo springing naked to the light <eos> and all his island shivered into flowers <eos>
again , and through the arras of the gloom <eos> are the pale breezes moaning : by her tomb <eos> bends julio , like a phantom , and his eye <eos> is fallen , as the moon borne tides , that lie <eos> at ebb within the sea . oh ! he is wan <eos> as winter skies are wan , like ages gone <eos> and stars unseen for paleness ; it is cast <eos> as foliage in the raving of the blast <eos> all his fair bloom of thoughts ! is the moon chill <eos> that in the dark clouds she is mantled still <eos> and over its proud arch hath heaven flung <eos> a scarf of darkness ? agath è was young <eos> and there should be the virgin silver there <eos> the snow white fringes delicately fair <eos>
o ye , who dwell in youth 's inviting bowers <eos> waste not , in useless joy , your fleeting hours <eos> but rather let the tears of sorrow roll <eos> and sad reflection fill the conscious soul <eos> for many a jocund spring has passed away <eos> and many a flower has blossomed , to decay <eos> and human life , still hastening to a close <eos> finds in the worthless dust its last repose <eos> still the vain world abounds in strife and hate <eos> and sire and son provoke each other 's fate <eos> and kindred blood by kindred hands is shed <eos> and vengeance sleeps not — dies not , with the dead <eos> all nature fades — the garden 's treasures fall <eos> young bud , and citron ripe — all perish , all <eos>
such age , how beautiful ! o lady bright <eos> whose mortal lineaments seem all refined <eos> by favouring nature and a saintly mind <eos> to something purer and more exquisite <eos> than flesh and blood ; whene'er thou meet'est my sight <eos> when i behold thy blanched unwithered cheek <eos> thy temples fringed with locks of gleaming white <eos> and head that droops because the soul is meek <eos> thee with the welcome snowdrop i compare <eos> that child of winter , prompting thoughts that climb <eos> from desolation toward the genial prime <eos> or with the moon conquering earth 's misty air <eos> and filling more and more with crystal light <eos> as pensive evening deepens into night <eos>
viii . if thou didst pass by art , thou didst not scorn <eos> the souls that by such symbol yearned in vain <eos> from truth and love true nourishment to gain <eos> on thy warm breast , so chilly and forlorn <eos> fell these thy nurslings little more than born <eos> that thou wast anguished , and there fell a rain <eos> from thy blest eyelids , and in grief and pain <eos> thou partedst from them yet one night and morn <eos> to find them wholesome food and nourishment <eos> instead of what their blindness took for such <eos> laying thyself a seed in earthen rent <eos> from which , outspringing to the willing touch <eos> riseth for all thy children harvest great <eos> for which they will all learn to bless thee yet <eos>
oh , had we room to rip the mighty bags <eos> that time , the harlequin , has stuffed with rags <eos> grant us one moment to unloose the strings <eos> while the old graybeard shuts his leather wings <eos> but what a heap of motley trash appears <eos> crammed in the bundles of successive years <eos> as the lost rustic on some festal day <eos> stares through the concourse in its vast array <eos> where in one cake a throng of faces runs <eos> all stuck together like a sheet of buns <eos> and throws the bait of some unheeded name <eos> or shoots a wink with most uncertain aim <eos> so roams my vision , wandering over all <eos> and strives to choose , but knows not where to fall <eos>
the saint who shuts outside his placid soul <eos> all touch of sense , letting no contact through <eos> whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows <eos> whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn <eos> equal and slow through nostrils still and close <eos> that one with organs , heart , and mind constrained <eos> bent on deliverance , having put away <eos> passion , and fear , and rage ;— hath , even now <eos> obtained deliverance , ever and ever freed <eos> yea ! for he knows me who am he that heeds <eos> the sacrifice and worship , god revealed <eos> and he who heeds not , being lord of worlds <eos> lover of all that lives , god unrevealed <eos> wherein who will shall find surety and shield <eos>
gazing he spoke , and , kindling at the view <eos> his eager arms around the goddess threw <eos> glad earth perceives , and from her bosom pours <eos> unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers <eos> thick new born violets a soft carpet spread <eos> and clustering lotos swell ’ d the rising bed <eos> and sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow <eos> and flamy crocus made the mountain glow <eos> there golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair <eos> steep ’ d in soft joys and circumfused with air <eos> celestial dews , descending o ’ er the ground <eos> perfume the mount , and breathe ambrosia round <eos> at length , with love and sleep ’ s soft power oppress ’ d <eos> the panting thunderer nods , and sinks to rest <eos>
most men know love but as a part of life <eos> they hide it in some corner of the breast <eos> even from themselves ; and only when they rest <eos> in the brief pauses of that daily strife <eos> wherewith the world might else be not so rife <eos> they draw it forth ( as one draws forth a toy <eos> to soothe some ardent , kiss exacting boy <eos> and hold it up to sister , child , or wife <eos> ah me ! why may not love and life be one <eos> why walk we thus alone , when by our side <eos> love , like a visible god , might be our guide <eos> how would the marts grow noble ! and the street <eos> worn like a dungeon floor by weary feet <eos> seem then a golden court way of the sun <eos>
i , strengthened , left him . next in a close place <eos> mid houses crowded , dingy , barred , and high <eos> where men live not except to sell and buy <eos> to me , leaving a doorway , came a grace <eos> ( surely from heaven she came , though all that race <eos> walketh on human feet beneath the sky <eos> i , going on , beheld not who was nigh <eos> when a sweet girl looked up into my face <eos> with earnest eyes , most maidenly sedate <eos> looked up to me , as i to him did look <eos> ‘ twas much to me whom sometimes men mistook <eos> she asked me where we dwelt , that she might wait <eos> upon us there . i told her , and elate <eos> went on my way to seek another nook <eos>
i had forgotten what i had lightly said <eos> and without speech , without a thought i went <eos> steeped in that golden quiet , all content <eos> to drink the transient beauty as it sped <eos> out of eternal darkness into time <eos> to light and burn and know itself a fire <eos> yet doomed — ah , fate of the fulfilled desire <eos> to fade , a meteor , paying for the crime <eos> of living glorious in the denser air <eos> of our material earth . a strange despair <eos> an agony , yet strangely , subtly sweet <eos> and tender as an unpassionate caress <eos> filled me ... oh laughter ! youth 's conceit <eos> grown almost conscious of youth 's feebleness <eos>
the spring returns ! what matters then that war <eos> on the horizon like a beacon burns <eos> that death ascends , man 's most desired star <eos> that darkness is his hope ? the spring returns <eos> triumphant through the wider arched cope <eos> she comes , she comes , unto her tyranny <eos> and at her coronation are set ope <eos> the prisons of the mind , and man is free <eos> the beggar garbed or over bent with snows <eos> each mortal , long defeated , disallowed <eos> feeling her touch , grows stronger limbed , and knows <eos> the purple on his shoulders and is proud <eos> the spring returns ! o madness beyond sense <eos> breed in our bones thine own omnipotence <eos>
where slanting banks are always with the sun <eos> the daisy is in blossom even now <eos> and where warm patches by the hedges run <eos> the cottager when coming home from plough <eos> brings home a cowslip root in flower to set <eos> thus ere the christmas goes the spring is met <eos> setting up little tents about the fields <eos> in sheltered spots .— primroses when they get <eos> behind the wood 's old roots , where ivy shields <eos> their crimpled , curdled leaves , will shine and hide <eos> cart ruts and horses ’ footings scarcely yield <eos> a slur for boys , just crizzled and that 's all <eos> frost shoots his needles by the small dyke side <eos> and snow in scarce a feather 's seen to fall <eos>
a lofty type of all her sex , i ween <eos> my english brothers , though your wayward race <eos> now slight the soul that never wore a screen <eos> and loved too well to keep her noble place <eos> ah , bravest woman that our world hath seen <eos> ( a light in spaces wild and tempest tost <eos> in every verse of thine , behold , we trace <eos> the full reflection of an earnest face <eos> and hear the scrawling of an eager pen <eos> o sisters ! knowing what you 've loved and lost <eos> i ask where shall we find its like , and when <eos> that dear heart with its passion sorrow crost <eos> and pathos rippling , like a brook in june <eos> amongst the roses of a windless noon <eos>
till all have ceased for ever , and the sum <eos> be summed of all the sumless curses told <eos> out on his head by all dark seasons rolled <eos> over its cursed and crowned existence , dumb <eos> and blind and stark as though the snows made numb <eos> all sense within it , and all conscience cold <eos> that hangs round hearts of less imperial mould <eos> like a snake feeding till their doomsday come <eos> o heart fast bound of frozen poison , be <eos> all nature 's as all true men 's hearts to thee <eos> a two edged sword of judgment ; hope be far <eos> and fear at hand for pilot oversea <eos> with death for compass and despair for star <eos> and the white foam a shroud for the white czar <eos>
“ yon cottager , who weaves at her own door <eos> pillow and bobbins all her little store <eos> content though mean , and cheerful if not gay <eos> shuffling her threads about the live long day <eos> just earns a scanty pittance , and at night <eos> lies down secure , her heart and pocket light <eos> she , for her humble sphere by nature fit <eos> has little understanding , and no wit <eos> receives no praise ; but , though her lot be such <eos> ( toilsome and indigent ) she renders much <eos> just knows , and knows no more , her bible true <eos> a truth the brilliant frenchman never knew <eos> and in that charter reads with sparkling eyes <eos> her title to a treasure in the skies <eos>
if ever any justly might complain <eos> of unrequited service , it is i <eos> change is the thanks i have for loyalty <eos> and only her reward is her disdain <eos> so as just spite did almost me constrain <eos> through torment her due praises to deny <eos> for he which vex è d is with injury <eos> by speaking ill doth ease his heart of pain <eos> but what , shall torture make me wrong her name <eos> no , no , a pris'ner constant thinks it shame <eos> though he ( were ) racked his first truth to gainsay <eos> her true given praise my first confession is <eos> though her disdain do rack me night and day <eos> this i confessed , and will deny in this <eos>
if , aged charon , when my life shall end <eos> i pass thy ferry and my waftage pay <eos> thy oars shall fall , thy boat and mast shall rend <eos> and through the deep shall be a dry foot way <eos> for why ? my heart with sighs doth breathe such flame <eos> that air and water both incens è d be <eos> the boundless ocean from whose mouth they came <eos> for from my heat not heaven itself is free <eos> then since to me thy loss can be no gain <eos> avoid thy harm and fly what i foretell <eos> make thou thy love with me for to be slain <eos> that i with her and both with thee may dwell <eos> thy fact thus , charon , both of us shall bless <eos> thou save thy boat and i my love possess <eos>
sweet sovereign , since so many minds remain <eos> obedient subjects at thy beauty 's call <eos> so many hearts bound in thy hairs as thrall <eos> so many eyes die with one look 's disdain <eos> go , seek the honour that doth thee pertain <eos> that the fifth monarchy may thee befall <eos> thou hast such means to conquer men withal <eos> as all the world must yield or else be slain <eos> to fight , thou need'st no weapons but thine eyes <eos> thine hair hath gold enough to pay thy men <eos> and for their food thy beauty will suffice <eos> for men and armour , lady , care have none <eos> for one will sooner yield unto thee then <eos> when he shall meet thee naked all alone <eos>
ingratitude , how deadly is thy smart <eos> proceeding from the form we fondly love <eos> how light , compared , all other sorrows prove <eos> thou shed'st a night of woe , from whence depart <eos> the gentle beams of patience , that the heart <eos> ‘ mid lesser ills , illume .— thy victims rove <eos> unquiet as the ghost that haunts the grove <eos> where murder spilt the life blood .— o ! thy dart <eos> kills more than life ,— e'en all that makes life dear <eos> till we “ the sensible of pain ” wou 'd change <eos> for phrenzy , that defies the bitter tear <eos> or wish , in kindred callousness , to range <eos> where moon ey 'd idiocy , with fallen lip <eos> drags the loose knee , and intermitting step <eos>
time , the old humourist , has a trick to day <eos> of moving landmarks and of levelling down <eos> till into town the suburbs edge their way <eos> and in the suburbs you may scent the town <eos> with mount st. thus approaching muswell hill <eos> and clapham common marching with the mile <eos> you get a hammersmith that fills the bill <eos> a hampstead with a serious sense of style <eos> so this fair creature , pictured in the row <eos> as one of that ‘ gay adulterous world , ’ { 79 } whose round <eos> is by the serpentine , as well would show <eos> and might , i deem , as readily be found <eos> on streatham 's hill , or wimbledon 's , or where <eos> brixtonian kitchens lard the late dining air <eos>
the first created held a joyous bower <eos> a flowering field , the world 's sole wonderment <eos> high paradise , from whence a woman 's power <eos> enticed him to fall to endless banishment <eos> this on the banks of euphrates did stand <eos> till the first mover , by his wondrous might <eos> planted it in thine eyes , thy face , thy hands <eos> from whence the world receives his fairest light <eos> thy cheeks contain choice flowers ; thy eyes , two suns <eos> thy hands , the fruit that no life blood can stain <eos> and in thy breath , that heavenly music wons <eos> which , when thou speak'st , angels their voices strain <eos> as from the first thy sex exil è d me <eos> so to this next let me be called by thee <eos>
keep love for youth , and violets for the spring <eos> of if these bloom when worn out autumn grieves <eos> let them lie hid in double shade of leaves <eos> their own , and others dropped down withering <eos> for violets suit when home birds build and sing <eos> not when the outbound bird a passage cleaves <eos> not with dry stubble of mown harvest sheaves <eos> but when the green world buds to blossoming <eos> keep violets for the spring , and love for youth <eos> love that should dwell with beauty , mirth , and hope <eos> or if a later sadder love be born <eos> let this not look for grace beyond its scope <eos> but give itself , nor plead for answering truth <eos> a grateful ruth tho ’ gleaning scanty corn <eos>
and again he pointed across the sea <eos> and another vision arose in me <eos> and i knew i walked an ocean of fear <eos> yet of safety too , for the master was near <eos> and every wave of sorrow or dread <eos> o'er which strong faith should upraise my head <eos> would show from the height of its troubled crest <eos> still nearer and nearer the land of rest <eos> and when the storm spray on the wind should arise <eos> and with tears unbidden should blind mine eyes <eos> and hide from my vision the home of love <eos> i knew i must look to the star above <eos> and the mists of passion would quickly flee <eos> and the storm would faint to serenity <eos>
and so the empty handed years went round <eos> vacant , though voiceful with prophetic sound <eos> and so , that summer morn , he sat and mused <eos> with folded , patient hands , as he was used <eos> and dreamily before his half closed sight <eos> floated the vision of his lost delight <eos> beside him , motionless , the drowsy bird <eos> dreamed of the chase , and in his slumber heard <eos> the sudden , scythe like sweep of wings , that dare <eos> the headlong plunge thro ’ eddying gulfs of air <eos> then , starting broad awake upon his perch <eos> tinkled his bells , like mass bells in a church <eos> and , looking at his master , seemed to say <eos> “ ser federigo , shall we hunt to day <eos>
whenas i wish , fair licia , for a kiss <eos> from those sweet lips where rose and lilies strive <eos> straight do mine eyes repine at such a bliss <eos> and seek my lips thereof for to deprive <eos> whenas i seek to glut mine eyes by sight <eos> my lips repine and call mine eyes away <eos> thus both contend to have each other 's right <eos> and both conspire to work my full decay <eos> o force admired of beauty in her pride <eos> in whose each part such strange effects there be <eos> that all my forces in themselves divide <eos> and make my senses plainly disagree <eos> if all were mine , this envy would be gone <eos> then grant me all , fair sweet , or grant me none <eos>
“ whatever spirit , careless of his charge <eos> his post neglects , or leaves the fair at large <eos> shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins <eos> be stopped in vials , or transfixed with pins <eos> or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie <eos> or wedged whole ages in a bodkin 's eye <eos> gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain <eos> while clogged he beats his silken wings in vain <eos> or alum styptics with contracting power <eos> shrink his thin essence like a rivelled flower <eos> or , as ixion fixed , the wretch shall feel <eos> the giddy motion of the whirling mill <eos> in fumes of burning chocolate shall glow <eos> and tremble at the sea that froths below <eos>
long have i loved the beauty of thy streets <eos> fair dublin : long , with unavailing vows <eos> sigh 'd to all guardian deities who rouse <eos> the spirits of dead nations to new heats <eos> of life and triumph :— vain the fond conceits <eos> nestling like eaves warmed doves ‘ neath patriot brows <eos> vain as the “ hope , ” that from thy custom house <eos> looks o'er the vacant bay in vain for fleets <eos> genius alone brings back the days of yore <eos> look ! look , what life is in these quaint old shops <eos> the loneliest lanes are rattling with the roar <eos> of coach and chair ; fans , feathers , flambeaus , fops <eos> flutter and flicker through yon open door <eos> where handel 's hand moves the great organ stops <eos>
there 's never a delicate nurseling of the year <eos> but our huge london hails it , and delights <eos> to wear it on her breast or at her ear <eos> her days to colour and make sweet her nights <eos> crocus and daffodil and violet <eos> pink , primrose , valley lily , clove carnation <eos> red rose and white rose , wall flower , mignonette <eos> the daisies all — these be her recreation <eos> her gaudies these ! and forth from drury lane <eos> trapesing in any of her whirl of weathers <eos> her flower girls foot it , honest and hoarse and vain <eos> all boot and little shawl and wilted feathers <eos> of populous corners right advantage taking <eos> and , where they squat , endlessly posy making <eos>
kate ( in much indignation ) . refused ! i knew it <eos> the crass ingratitude of haughty man <eos> vested in all the pride of place and power <eos> brooks not the aspirations of my sex <eos> however just . is't that he fears to yield <eos> lest from his laurelled brow the wreath should fall <eos> and light on ours ? we may matriculate <eos> and graduate — if we can , but he excludes <eos> us from the beaten path he takes himself <eos> the sun lit heights of steep parnassus <eos> reach past the clouds , and we below must stay <eos> not that our alpen stocks are weak , or that <eos> our breath comes short , but that , forsooth , we wear <eos> the petticoat . out on such trash <eos>
such gifts are sweetest when unsought . to me <eos> as i was loitering lately in my dreams <eos> passing from one remembrance to another <eos> like him who reads upon an outstretched map <eos> content and idly happy , these rose up <eos> out of that magic well stored picture house <eos> no dream , rather a thing most keenly real <eos> the memory of a moment , when with feet <eos> arrested and spell bound , and captured eyes <eos> made wide with joy and wonder , i beheld <eos> the spaces of a white and wintery land <eos> swept with the fire of sunset , all its width <eos> vale , forest , town , and misty eminence <eos> a miracle of color and of beauty <eos>
resolved to love , unworthy to obtain <eos> i do no favour crave ; but , humble wise <eos> to thee my sighs in verse i sacrifice <eos> only some pity and no help to gain <eos> hear then , and as my heart shall aye remain <eos> a patient object to thy lightning eyes <eos> a patient ear bring thou to thund'ring cries <eos> fear not the crack , when i the blow sustain <eos> so as thine eye bred mine ambitious thought <eos> so shall thine ear make proud my voice for joy <eos> lo , dear , what wonders great by thee are wrought <eos> when i but little favour do enjoy <eos> the voice is made the ear for to rejoice <eos> and your ear giveth pleasure to my voice <eos>
dan cupid , though the god of soft amour <eos> in ev'ry age works miracles a store <eos> can catos change to male coquets at ease <eos> and fools make oracles whene'er he please <eos> turn wolves to sheep , and ev'ry thing so well <eos> that naught remains the former shape to tell <eos> remember , hercules , with wond'rous pow'r <eos> and polyphemus , who would men devour <eos> the one upon a rock himself would fling <eos> and to the winds his am'rous ditties sing <eos> to cut his beard a nymph could him inspire <eos> and , in the water , he 'd his face admire <eos> his club the other to a spindle changed <eos> to please the belle with whom he often ranged <eos>
if tired of trees i seek again mankind <eos> well i know where to hie me — in the dawn <eos> to a slope where the cattle keep the lawn <eos> there amid lolling juniper reclined <eos> myself unseen , i see in white defined <eos> far off the homes of men , and farther still <eos> the graves of men on an opposing hill <eos> living or dead , whichever are to mind <eos> and if by moon i have too much of these <eos> i have but to turn on my arm , and lo <eos> the sun burned hillside sets my face aglow <eos> my breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze <eos> i smell the earth , i smell the bruis è d plant <eos> i look into the crater of the ant <eos>
what time the romaine empire bore the raine <eos> of all the world , and florisht most in might <eos> the nations gan their soveraigntie disdaine <eos> and cast to quitt them from their bondage quight <eos> so , when all shrouded were in silent night <eos> the galles were , by corrupting of a mayde <eos> possest nigh of the capitol through slight <eos> had not a goose the treachery bewrayde <eos> if then a goose great rome from ruine stayde <eos> and iove himselfe , the patron of the place <eos> preservd from being to his foes betrayde <eos> why do vaine men mean things so much deface <eos> and in their might repose their most assurance <eos> sith nought on earth can chalenge long endurance <eos>
when love puffed up with rage of high disdain <eos> resolved to make me pattern of his might <eos> like foe , whose wits inclined to deadly spite <eos> would often kill , to breed more feeling pain <eos> he would not , armed with beauty , only reign <eos> on those affects which easily yield to sight <eos> but virtue sets so high , that reason 's light <eos> for all his strife can only bondage gain <eos> so that i live to pay a mortal fee <eos> dead palsy sick of all my chiefest parts <eos> like those whom dreams make ugly monsters see <eos> and can cry help with naught but groans and starts <eos> longing to have , having no wit to wish <eos> to starving minds such is god cupid 's dish <eos>
and speaking thus , he leapt on black lewin <eos> and smote him twice full hard upon the chin <eos> two goodly blows upon that big , black jowl <eos> whereat black lewin lustily did howl <eos> and falling back , his polished bascinet <eos> with ringing clash the cold , hard flagstones met <eos> whereat his fellows , shouting fierce alarms <eos> incontinent betook them to their arms <eos> and thus it seemed a fight there must have been <eos> but that a horseman sudden spurred between <eos> a blue eyed youth with yellow , curling hair <eos> of slender shape , of face and feature fair <eos> a dainty knight was he in very truth <eos> a blue eyed , merry , laughter loving youth <eos>
can it be right to give what i can give <eos> to let thee sit beneath the fall of tears <eos> as salt as mine , and hear the sighing years <eos> re sighing on my lips renunciative <eos> through those infrequent smiles which fail to live <eos> for all thy adjurations ? o my fears <eos> that this can scarce be right ! we are not peers <eos> so to be lovers ; and i own , and grieve <eos> that givers of such gifts as mine are , must <eos> be counted with the ungenerous . out , alas <eos> i will not soil thy purple with my dust <eos> nor breathe my poison on thy venice glass <eos> nor give thee any love — which were unjust <eos> beloved , i only love thee ! let it pass <eos>
if thy soul check thee that i come so near <eos> swear to thy blind soul that i was thy ‘ will <eos> and will thy soul knows is admitted there <eos> thus far for love , my love suit sweet fulfil <eos> ‘ will ’ , will fulfil the treasure of thy love <eos> ay , fill it full with wills , and my will one <eos> in things of great receipt with case we prove <eos> among a number one is reckoned none <eos> then in the number let me pass untold <eos> though in thy store 's account i one must be <eos> for nothing hold me , so it please thee hold <eos> that nothing me , a something sweet to thee <eos> make but my name thy love , and love that still <eos> and then thou lov'st me for my name is will <eos>
there where the ash pale forest leaves were touched <eos> by morning 's shining fingers , and the inland depths <eos> sent out rain plenished voices west and south <eos> the steel clad scouts of esarhaddon came <eos> and searched , and found manasseh whom they bound <eos> and dragged before the swart assyrian king <eos> and esarhaddon , scourge of heaven , sent <eos> to strange evil at its chiefest fanes <eos> and so fulfil a dread divine decree <eos> took judah 's despot , fettered hand and foot <eos> and cast him bleeding on a dungeon floor <eos> hard by where swift euphrates chafes his brink <eos> and gleams from cataract to cataract <eos> and gives the gale a deep midwinter tone <eos>

shall i then silent be , or shall i speake <eos> and if i speake , her wrath renew i shall <eos> and if i silent be , my hart will breake <eos> or choked be with overflowing gall <eos> what tyranny is this , both my hart to thrall <eos> and eke my toung with proud restraint to tie <eos> that neither i may speake nor thinke at all <eos> but like a stupid stock in silence die <eos> yet i my hart with silence secretly <eos> will teach to speak and my just cause to plead <eos> and eke mine eies , with meek humility <eos> love learned letters to her eyes to read <eos> which her deep wit , that true harts thought can spel <eos> wil soon conceive , and learne to construe well <eos>
now hearkening thus , they both became aware <eos> of distant bells that throbbed upon the air <eos> a faint , insistent sound that rose and fell <eos> a clamour vague that ominous did swell <eos> as thus they stood , well hidden from the road <eos> footsteps they heard of feet that briskly strode <eos> and , through the leaves , a small man they espied <eos> who came apace , a great sword by his side <eos> large bascinet upon his head he bore <eos> ‘ neath which his face a scowl portentous wore <eos> while after toiled a stout but reverend friar <eos> who , scant of breath , profusely did perspire <eos> and , thus perspiring , panted sad complaints <eos> thus — on the heat , his comrade and the saints <eos>
the laurel leafe which you this day doe weare <eos> gives me great hope of your relenting mynd <eos> for since it is the badge which i doe beare <eos> ye , bearing it , doe seeme to me inclind <eos> the powre thereof , which ofte in me i find <eos> let it likewise your gentle brest inspire <eos> with sweet infusion , and put you in mind <eos> of that proud mayd whom now those leaves attyre <eos> proud daphne , scorning phrebus lovely ** fyre <eos> on the thessalian shore from him did flie <eos> for which the gods , in theyr revengefull yre <eos> did her transforme into a laurell tree <eos> then fly no more , fayre love , from phebus chace <eos> but in your brest his leafe and love embrace <eos>
while loftier souls command , nay , make their fate <eos> thy fate made thee and forced thee to be great <eos> yet fortune , who so oft , so blindly sheds <eos> her brightest halo round the weakest heads <eos> found thee undazzled , tranquil as before <eos> proud to be useful , scorning to be more <eos> less moved by glory 's than by duty 's claim <eos> renown the meed , but self applause the aim <eos> all that thou wert reflects less fame on thee <eos> far less , than all thou didst forbear to be <eos> nor yet the patriot of one land alone <eos> for , thine 's a name all nations claim their own <eos> and every shore , where breathed the good and brave <eos> echoed the plaudits thy own country gave <eos>
long having deeply gron 'd these visions sad <eos> i saw a citie like unto that same <eos> which saw the messenger of tidings glad <eos> but that on sand was built the goodly frame <eos> it seem 'd her top the firmament did rayse <eos> and , no lesse rich than faire , right worthie sure <eos> ( if ought here worthie ) of immortall dayes <eos> or if ought under heaven might firme endure <eos> much wondred i to see so faire a wall <eos> when from the northerns coast a storme arose <eos> which , breathing furie from his inward gall <eos> on all which did against his course oppose <eos> into a clowde of dust sperst in the aire <eos> the weake foundations of this citie faire <eos>
away they went , and gyges much admired <eos> still more than that : in truth his breast was fired <eos> for when she moved astonishment was great <eos> and ev'ry grace upon her seemed to wait <eos> emotion to suppress howe'er he tried <eos> since he had promised what he felt to hide <eos> to hold his tongue he wished , but that might raise <eos> suspicions of designs and mystick ways <eos> exaggeration was the better part <eos> and from the subject he would never start <eos> but fully praised each beauty in detail <eos> without appearing any thing to veil <eos> gods ! gyges cried , how truly , king , you 're blessed <eos> the skin how fair — how charming all the rest <eos>

what meanes this numerous guard ? or do we come <eos> to file our names or verse upon the tombe <eos> of fletcher , and by boldly making knowne <eos> his wit , betray the nothing of our owne <eos> for if we grant him dead , it is as true <eos> against our selves , no wit , no poet now <eos> or if he be returnd from his coole shade <eos> to us , this booke his resurrection 's made <eos> we bleed our selves to death , and but contrive <eos> by our owne epitaphs to shew him alive <eos> but let him live and let me prophesie <eos> as i goe swan like out , our peace is nigh <eos> a balme unto the wounded age i sing <eos> and nothing now is wanting but the king <eos>
then hate me when thou wilt , if ever , now <eos> now while the world is bent my deeds to cross <eos> join with the spite of fortune , make me bow <eos> and do not drop in for an after loss <eos> ah do not , when my heart hath ‘ scaped this sorrow <eos> come in the rearward of a conquered woe <eos> give not a windy night a rainy morrow <eos> to linger out a purposed overthrow <eos> if thou wilt leave me , do not leave me last <eos> when other petty griefs have done their spite <eos> but in the onset come , so shall i taste <eos> at first the very worst of fortune 's might <eos> and other strains of woe , which now seem woe <eos> compared with loss of thee , will not seem so <eos>
sudden , while olive gazed , she thought a flame <eos> sprang from her feet , when looking , startled , down <eos> she saw the glory of the rising sun <eos> touching the pinnacle of sparkling ice <eos> on which she stood . silent and rapt she gazed <eos> while thousand golden flames on thousand spires <eos> were low and lower lit ; and here and there <eos> some broad plain glimmered into sudden white <eos> and frozen cataracts which , in daring leaps <eos> midway between vast depths were holden tight <eos> gleamed out like streams of gold :— thus , one by one <eos> the wonders of that soulless land appeared <eos> while grey and ghast , behind the sparkling towers <eos> of gorgeous thug , the ancient night stooped down <eos>
‘ twill grieve me more than if thou didst disdain me <eos> that i should die ; and thou , because i die so <eos> and yet to die , it should not know to pain me <eos> if cruel beauty were content to bid so <eos> death to my life , life to my long despair <eos> prolonged by her , given to my love and days <eos> are means to tell how truly she is fair <eos> and i can die to testify her praise <eos> yet not to die , though fairness me despiseth <eos> is cause why in complaint i thus pers è ver <eos> though death me and my love inparadiseth <eos> by interdicting me from her for ever <eos> i do not grieve that i am forced to die <eos> but die to think upon the reason why <eos>
degenerate douglas ! oh , the unworthy lord <eos> whom mere despite of heart could so far please <eos> and love of havoc ( for with such disease <eos> fame taxes him ) that he could send forth word <eos> to level with the dust a noble horde <eos> a brotherhood of venerable trees <eos> leaving an ancient dome , and towers like these <eos> beggared and outraged !— many hearts deplor 'd <eos> the fate of those old trees ; and oft with pain <eos> the traveller , at this day , will stop and gaze <eos> on wrongs , which nature scarcely seems to heed <eos> for shelter 'd places , bosoms , nooks and bays <eos> and the pure mountains , and the gentle tweed <eos> and the green silent pastures , yet remain <eos>
day 's golden eye had closed , his ruddy light <eos> expiring on the bosom of the night <eos> and solitary twilight 's deepening shade <eos> in dusky robe the firmament array 'd <eos> the moon , resplendent , fill 'd her glittering throne <eos> and tipp 'd with yellow gems all ether shone <eos> the breeze was silent on the glassy deep <eos> and half the world was sinking into sleep <eos> save where the shepherd led his fleecy train <eos> to crop the verdure of the moon light plain <eos> save where the warder on the turret 's height <eos> trimm 'd his weak lamp , and watch 'd the bell of night <eos> and the lone captive , in the dungeon 's gloom <eos> with beating pulse look 'd forward to his doom <eos>
when pandarus beheld his brother kill 'd <eos> the town with fear and wild confusion fill 'd <eos> he turns the hinges of the heavy gate <eos> with both his hands , and adds his shoulders to the weight <eos> some happier friends within the walls inclos 'd <eos> the rest shut out , to certain death expos 'd <eos> fool as he was , and frantic in his care <eos> t ’ admit young turnus , and include the war <eos> he thrust amid the crowd , securely bold <eos> like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold <eos> too late his blazing buckler they descry <eos> and sparkling fires that shot from either eye <eos> his mighty members , and his ample breast <eos> his rattling armor , and his crimson crest <eos>
over the threshold of his pleasant home <eos> set in green clearings passed the exiled friend <eos> in simple trust , misdoubting not the end <eos> “ dear heart of mine ! ” he said , “ the time has come <eos> to trust the lord for shelter . ” one long gaze <eos> the goodwife turned on each familiar thing <eos> the lowing kine , the orchard blossoming <eos> the open door that showed the hearth fire 's blaze <eos> and calmly answered , “ yes , he will provide <eos> silent and slow they crossed the homestead 's bound <eos> lingering the longest by their child 's grave mound <eos> “ move on , or stay and hang ! ” the sheriff cried <eos> they left behind them more than home or land <eos> and set sad faces to an alien strand <eos>
chained by stern duty to the rock of state <eos> his spirit armed in mail of rugged mirth <eos> ever above , though ever near to earth <eos> yet felt his heart the cruel tongues that sate <eos> base appetites and , foul with slander , wait <eos> till the keen lightnings bring the awful hour <eos> when wounds and suffering shall give them power <eos> most was he like to luther , gay and great <eos> solemn and mirthful , strong of heart and limb <eos> tender and simple , too ; he was so near <eos> to all things human that he cast out fear <eos> and , ever simpler , like a little child <eos> lived in unconscious nearness unto him <eos> who always on earth 's little ones hath smiled <eos>
falsely doth envy of your praises blame <eos> my tongue , my pen , my heart of flattery <eos> because i said there was no sun but thee <eos> it called my tongue the partial trump of fame <eos> and saith my pen hath flatter è d thy name <eos> because my pen did to my tongue agree <eos> and that my heart must needs a flatterer be <eos> which taught both tongue and pen to say the same <eos> no , no , i flatter not when thee i call <eos> the sun , sith that the sun was never such <eos> but when the sun thee i compared withal <eos> doubtless the sun i flatter è d too much <eos> witness mine eyes , i say the truth in this <eos> they have seen thee and know that so it is <eos>
then i again inquir 'd : “ where flow the streams <eos> of phlegethon and lethe ? for of one <eos> thou tell'st not , and the other of that shower <eos> thou say'st , is form 'd . ” he answer thus return 'd <eos> “ doubtless thy questions all well pleas 'd i hear <eos> yet the red seething wave might have resolv 'd <eos> one thou proposest . lethe thou shalt see <eos> but not within this hollow , in the place <eos> whither to lave themselves the spirits go <eos> whose blame hath been by penitence remov 'd <eos> he added : “ time is now we quit the wood <eos> look thou my steps pursue : the margins give <eos> safe passage , unimpeded by the flames <eos> for over them all vapour is extinct <eos>
milton ! thou shouldst be living at this hour <eos> england hath need of thee ; she is a fen <eos> of stagnant waters ; altar , sword , and pen <eos> fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower <eos> have forfeited their ancient english dower <eos> of inward happiness . we are selfish men <eos> oh ! raise us up , return to us again <eos> and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power <eos> thy soul was like a star , and dwelt apart <eos> thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea <eos> pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free <eos> so didst thou travel on life 's common way <eos> in cheerful godliness ; and yet thy heart <eos> the lowliest duties on herself did lay <eos>
here is the place where loveliness keeps house <eos> between the river and the wooded hills <eos> within a valley where the springtime spills <eos> her firstling wind flowers under blossoming boughs <eos> where summer sits braiding her warm , white brows <eos> with bramble roses ; and where autumn fills <eos> her lap with asters ; and old winter frills <eos> with crimson haw and hip his snowy blouse <eos> here you may meet with beauty . here she sits <eos> gazing upon the moon , or all the day <eos> tuning a wood thrush flute , remote , unseen <eos> or when the storm is out , ‘ t is she who flits <eos> from rock to rock , a form of flying spray <eos> shouting , beneath the leaves ’ tumultuous green <eos>
if heaven a date of many years would give <eos> thus i 'd in pleasure , ease , and plenty live <eos> and as i near approach [ ed ] the verge of life <eos> some kind relation ( for i 'd have no wife <eos> should take upon him all my worldly care <eos> while i did for a better state prepare <eos> then i 'd not be with any trouble vexed <eos> nor have the evening of my days perplexed <eos> but by a silent and a peaceful death <eos> without a sigh , resign my aged breath <eos> and , when committed to the dust , i 'd have <eos> few tears , but friendly , dropped into my grave <eos> then would my exit so propitious be <eos> all men would wish to live and die like me <eos>
well , i felt for the lady , and felt for my hat too <eos> improvised on the crown of the latter a tattoo <eos> in lieu of expressing the feelings which lay <eos> quite too deep for words , as wordsworth would say <eos> then , without going through the form of a bow <eos> found myself in the entry ,— i hardly knew how <eos> on doorstep and sidewalk , past lamp post and square <eos> at home and up stairs , in my own easy chair <eos> poked my feet into slippers , my fire into blaze <eos> and said to myself , as i lit my cigar <eos> supposing a man had the wealth of the czar <eos> of the russias to boot , for the rest of his days <eos> on the whole do you think he would have much time to spare <eos> if he married a woman with nothing to wear <eos>
here , where peralta 's cattle used to stray <eos> here , where the spaniards in their early day <eos> rode , jingling , booted , spurred , nor ever guessed <eos> our race would own the land by them possessed <eos> here , where castilian bull fights left their stain <eos> of blood upon the soil of this new spain <eos> here , where old live oaks , spared till we condemn <eos> still wait within this city named for them <eos> we celebrate , with bombshell and with rhyme <eos> our noisiest day of days of yearly time <eos> o bare antonio 's hills that rim our sky <eos> antonio 's hills , that used to know july <eos> as but a time of sleep beneath the sun <eos> such days of languorous dreaming are all done <eos>
“ is this ( returns the prince ) for mirth a time <eos> when lawless gluttons riot , mirth 's a crime <eos> the luscious wines , dishonour 'd , lose their taste <eos> the song is noise , and impious is the feast <eos> suffice it to have spent with swift decay <eos> the wealth of kings , and made my youth a prey <eos> but now the wise instructions of the sage <eos> and manly thoughts inspired by manly age <eos> teach me to seek redress for all my woe <eos> here , or in pyle — in pyle , or here , your foe <eos> deny your vessels , ye deny in vain <eos> a private voyager i pass the main <eos> free breathe the winds , and free the billows flow <eos> and where on earth i live , i live your foe <eos>
methought that in a solemn church i stood <eos> its marble acres , worn with knees and feet <eos> lay spread from door to door , from street to street <eos> midway the form hung high upon the rood <eos> of him who gave his life to be our good <eos> beyond , priests flitted , bowed , and murmured meet <eos> among the candles , shining still and sweet <eos> men came and went , and worshipped as they could <eos> and still their dust a woman with her broom <eos> bowed to her work , kept sweeping to the door <eos> then saw i , slow through all the pillared gloom <eos> across the church a silent figure come <eos> “ daughter , ” it said , “ thou sweepest well my floor <eos> “ it is the lord ! ” i cried , and saw no more <eos>
tell me , my muse , my goddess from above <eos> of dazzling sheen , and clothed in robes of love <eos> what this wild rage — this cataclysmic fall <eos> what rends the welkin , and , who rules them all <eos> “ ‘ tis god ! the blest ! all elements are his <eos> who rules the unfathonable dark abyss <eos> ‘ tis god commands ! his edicts are their will <eos> be silent , heavens ! the heavens are hushed and still <eos> these are the wail of elemental life <eos> the fire and water wage supernal strife <eos> the blasting fire , with scathing , angry glare <eos> gleamed like an asphalte furnace in the air <eos> around , above it swirled the water 's sweep <eos> and plunged its scorching legions in the deep <eos>
at length i have thee ! my brisk new comer <eos> sounding thy lay to departing summer <eos> and i 'll take thee up from thy bed of grass <eos> and carry thee home to a house of glass <eos> where thy slender limbs , and the faded green <eos> of thy close made coat , can all be seen <eos> for i long to know if the cricket sings <eos> or plays the tune with his gauzy wings <eos> to bring that shrill toned pipe to light <eos> which kept me awake so long last night <eos> that i told the hours by the lazy clock <eos> till i heard the crow of the noisy cock <eos> when , tossing and turning , at length i fell <eos> in a sleep so strange , that the dream i 'll tell <eos>
“ the angels , o my brother ! and this clime <eos> wherein thou art , impassible and pure <eos> i call created , as indeed they are <eos> in their whole being . but the elements <eos> which thou hast nam 'd , and what of them is made <eos> are by created virtue ’ inform 'd : create <eos> their substance , and create the ’ informing virtue <eos> in these bright stars , that round them circling move <eos> the soul of every brute and of each plant <eos> the ray and motion of the sacred lights <eos> with complex potency attract and turn <eos> but this our life the ’ eternal good inspires <eos> immediate , and enamours of itself <eos> so that our wishes rest for ever here <eos>
far from his brawny hand euryalus hurled <eos> a massy stone , and shook the ranks of troy <eos> as when in anger against long screaming cranes <eos> a watcher of the field leaps from the ground <eos> in swift hand whirling round his head the sling <eos> and speeds the stone against them , scattering <eos> before its hum their ranks far down the wind <eos> outspread , and they in huddled panic dart <eos> with wild cries this way and that , who theretofore <eos> swept on in ordered lines ; so shrank the foe <eos> to right and left from that dread bolt of doom <eos> hurled of euryalus . not in vain it flew <eos> fate winged ; it shattered meles ’ helm and head <eos> down to the eyes : so met him ghastly death <eos>
i do compare unto thy youthly clear <eos> which always bides within thy flow'ring prime <eos> the month of april , that bedews our clime <eos> with pleasant flowers , when as his showers appear <eos> before thy face shall fly false cruelty <eos> before his face the doly season fleets <eos> mild been his looks , thine eyes are full of sweets <eos> firm is his course , firm is thy loyalty <eos> he paints the fields through liquid crystal showers <eos> thou paint'st my verse with pallas , learn è d flowers <eos> with zephirus ’ sweet , breath he fills the plains <eos> and thou my heart with weeping sighs dost wring <eos> his brows are dewed with morning 's crystal spring <eos> thou mak'st my eyes with tears bemoan my pains <eos>

full many a glorious morning have i seen <eos> flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye <eos> kissing with golden face the meadows green <eos> gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy <eos> anon permit the basest clouds to ride <eos> with ugly rack on his celestial face <eos> and from the forlorn world his visage hide <eos> stealing unseen to west with this disgrace <eos> even so my sun one early morn did shine <eos> with all triumphant splendour on my brow <eos> but out , alack ! he was but one hour mine <eos> the region cloud hath mask 'd him from me now <eos> yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth <eos> suns of the world may stain when heaven 's sun staineth <eos>

a hundred instances the fact attest <eos> but sage boccace has one , it is confessed <eos> which seems to me , howe'er we search around <eos> to be a sample , rarely to be found <eos> ‘ tis chimon that i mean , a savage youth <eos> well formed in person , but the rest uncouth <eos> a bear in mind , but cupid much can do <eos> love licked the cub , and decent soon he grew <eos> a fine gallant at length the lad appeared <eos> from whence the change ?— fine eyes his bosom cheered <eos> the piercing rays no sooner reached his sight <eos> but all the savage took at once to flight <eos> he felt the tender flame ; polite became <eos> you 'll find howe'er , our tale is not the same <eos>
cold , cold we rested on black peaks again <eos> under black skies , under a groping wind <eos> and life , grown old , hugged me to a numb breast <eos> pressing numb lips against me . suddenly <eos> a blade of silver severed the black peaks <eos> from the black sky , and earth was born again <eos> breathing and various , under a god 's feet <eos> a god ! a god ! i felt the heart of life <eos> leap under me , and my cold flanks shook again <eos> he bore no lyre , he rang no challenge out <eos> but life warmed to him , warming me with her <eos> and as he neared i felt beneath her hands <eos> the stab of a new wound that sucked my soul <eos> forth in a new song from my throbbing throat <eos>
“ i do beseech thee , god , show me thy face <eos> “ come up to me in sinai on the morn <eos> thou shalt behold as much as may be borne <eos> and moses on a rock stood lone in space <eos> from sinai 's top , the vaporous , thunderous place <eos> god passed in clouds , an earthly garment worn <eos> to hide , and thus reveal . in love , not scorn <eos> he put him in a cleft in the rock 's base <eos> covered him with his hand , his eyes to screen <eos> then passed , and showed his back through mists of years <eos> ah , moses ! had he turned , and hadst thou seen <eos> the pale face crowned with thorns , baptized with tears <eos> the eyes of the true man , by men belied <eos> thou hadst beheld god 's face , and straightway died <eos>
no man can understand the sea , until <eos> he knows all passions of the senses ; all <eos> the great emotions of the heart ; and each <eos> exalted aspiration of the soul <eos> then may he sit beside the sea and say <eos> ‘ i , too , have flung myself against the rocks <eos> and kissed their flinty brows with no return <eos> and fallen spent upon unfeeling sands <eos> i , too , have gone forth yearning , to far shores <eos> seeking that something which would bring content <eos> and finding only what i took away <eos> and i have looked up , through the veil of skies <eos> when all the world was still , and understood <eos> that i am one with nature and with god <eos>
one place there is — beneath the burial sod <eos> where all mankind are equalized by death <eos> another place there is — the fane of god <eos> where all are equal , who draw living breath <eos> juggle who will elsewhere with his own soul <eos> playing the judas with a temporal dole <eos> he who can come beneath that awful cope <eos> in the dread presence of a maker just <eos> who metes to ev'ry pinch of human dust <eos> one even measure of immortal hope <eos> he who can stand within that holy door <eos> with soul unbow 'd by that pure spirit level <eos> and frame unequal laws for rich and poor <eos> might sit for hell and represent the devil <eos>
methought his royal person did foretell <eos> a kingly stateliness , from all pride clear <eos> his look majestic seem è d to compel <eos> all men to love him , rather than to fear <eos> and yet though he were every good man 's joy <eos> and the alonely comfort of his own <eos> his very name with terror did annoy <eos> his foreign foes so far as he was known <eos> hell drooped for fear ; the turkey moon looked pale <eos> spain trembled ; and the most tempestuous sea <eos> ( where behemoth , the babylonish whale <eos> keeps all his bloody and imperious plea <eos> was swoln with rage , for fear he 'd stop the tide <eos> of her o'erhyppphendaring and insulting pride <eos>
up at his attic sill the south wind came <eos> and days of sun and storm but never peace <eos> along the town 's tumultuous arteries <eos> he heard the heart throbs of a sentient frame <eos> each night the whistles in the bay , the same <eos> whirl of incessant wheels and clanging cars <eos> for smoke that half obscured , the circling stars <eos> burnt like his youth with but a sickly flame <eos> up to his attic came the city cries <eos> the throes with which her iron sinews heave <eos> and yet forever behind prison doors <eos> welled in his heart and trembled in his eyes <eos> the light that hangs on desert hills at eve <eos> and tints the sea on solitary shores <eos>
she clapped her hands , and through the gallery pour <eos> equipped for flight , her vassals — greek and moor <eos> silent but quick they stoop , his chains unbind <eos> once more his limbs are free as mountain wind <eos> but on his heavy heart such sadness sate <eos> as if they there transferred that iron weight <eos> no words are uttered — at her sign , a door <eos> reveals the secret passage to the shore <eos> the city lies behind — they speed , they reach <eos> the glad waves dancing on the yellow beach <eos> and conrad following , at her beck , obeyed <eos> nor cared he now if rescued or betrayed <eos> resistance were as useless as if seyd <eos> yet lived to view the doom his ire decreed <eos>
safer with winds and waves than human wrath <eos> with ravening wolves than those whose zeal for god <eos> was cruelty to man , the exiles trod <eos> drear leagues of forest without guide or path <eos> or launching frail boats on the uncharted sea <eos> round storm vexed capes , whose teeth of granite ground <eos> the waves to foam , their perilous way they wound <eos> enduring all things so their souls were free <eos> oh , true confessors , shaming them who did <eos> anew the wrong their pilgrim fathers bore <eos> for you the mayflower spread her sail once more <eos> freighted with souls , to all that duty bid <eos> faithful as they who sought an unknown land <eos> o'er wintry seas , from holland 's hook of sand <eos>
i sing the pilgrim of a softer clime <eos> and milder speech than those brave men 's who brought <eos> to the ice and iron of our winter time <eos> a will as firm , a creed as stern , and wrought <eos> with one mailed hand , and with the other fought <eos> simply , as fits my theme , in homely rhyme <eos> i sing the blue eyed german spener taught <eos> through whose veiled , mystic faith the inward light <eos> steady and still , an easy brightness , shone <eos> transfiguring all things in its radiance white <eos> the garland which his meekness never sought <eos> i bring him ; over fields of harvest sown <eos> with seeds of blessing , now to ripeness grown <eos> i bid the sower pass before the reapers ’ sight <eos>
young pleasures sporting in luxurious ease <eos> and infant cupid 's on his amour seize <eos> some dragg 'd the bloody cuirass o'er the ground <eos> 305 or from his thigh , the pond'rous blade unbound <eos> some from the casque the crystal torrent pour 'd <eos> to wash the crimson spot that stain 'd the sword <eos> and laugh as in their feeble hand they wield <eos> the crown 's support , the terror of the field <eos> 310 discord , who view 'd him with insulting spite <eos> in savage accents utter 'd fierce delight <eos> rous 'd up the league , the happy moment prest <eos> reviv 'd her serpents drooping in her breast <eos> and while the monarch languished in repose <eos> 315 blew the shrill blast , that gathered all his foes <eos>
the insect world , now sunbeams higher climb <eos> oft dream of spring , and wake before their time <eos> bees stroke their little legs across their wings <eos> and venture short flights where the snow drop hings <eos> its silver bell , and winter aconite <eos> its buttercup like flowers that shut at night <eos> with green leaf furling round its cup of gold <eos> like tender maiden muffled from the cold <eos> they sip and find their honey dreams are vain <eos> then feebly hasten to their hives again <eos> the butterflies , by eager hopes undone <eos> glad as a child come out to greet the sun <eos> beneath the shadows of a sunny shower <eos> are lost , nor see to morrow 's april flower <eos>
my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still <eos> while comments of your praise richly compiled <eos> reserve their character with golden quill <eos> and precious phrase by all the muses filed <eos> i think good thoughts , whilst other write good words <eos> and like unlettered clerk still cry amen <eos> to every hymn that able spirit affords <eos> in polished form of well refined pen <eos> hearing you praised , i say ‘ tis so , ‘ tis true <eos> and to the most of praise add something more <eos> but that is in my thought , whose love to you <eos> ( though words come hindmost ) holds his rank before <eos> then others , for the breath of words respect <eos> me for my dumb thoughts , speaking in effect <eos>
‘ whatever spirit , careless of his charge <eos> his post neglects , or leaves the fair at large <eos> shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins <eos> be stopped in vials , or transfixed with pins <eos> or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie <eos> or wedged whole ages in a bodkin 's eye <eos> gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain <eos> while clogged he beats his silken wings in vain <eos> or alum styptics with contracting power <eos> shrink his thin essence like a rivelled flower <eos> or , as ixion fixed , the wretch shall feel <eos> the giddy motion of the whirling mill <eos> in fumes of burning chocolate shall glow <eos> and tremble at the sea that froths below <eos>
a shady nook where nought is overheard <eos> but wind among the eucalyptus leaves <eos> the cheery chirp of interflitting bird <eos> or wooden squeak of tree frog as it grieves <eos> the resting eye broods o'er the running grass <eos> or nodding gestures of the bowed wild oats <eos> watches the oleander lancers pass <eos> and the bright flashing of the oriole notes <eos> hushed are the senses with the drone of bees <eos> and the far glimmer of the mid day heat <eos> dreams stealing o'er one like the incoming seas <eos> soft as the rustling zephyrs in the wheat <eos> while on the breeze is borne the call of love <eos> to love , dear love , of majel , the wild dove <eos>

but thus it is . two songs have men and maidens <eos> one is for hey day , one is sorrow 's cadence <eos> our voices vary with the changing seasons <eos> of life 's long year , for deep and natural reasons <eos> therefore despair not . think not you have altered <eos> if , at some time , the gayer note has faltered <eos> we are as god has made us . gladness , pain <eos> delight and death , and moods of bliss or bane <eos> with love and hate , or good and evil — all <eos> at separate times , in separate accents call <eos> yet ‘ t is the same heart throb within the breast <eos> that gives an impulse to our worst and best <eos> i doubt not when our earthly cries are ended <eos> the listener finds them in one music blended <eos>
is it her nature , or is it her will <eos> to be so cruell to an humbled foe <eos> if nature , then she may it mend with skill <eos> if will , then she at will may will forgoe <eos> but if her nature and her will be so <eos> that she will plague the man that loves her most <eos> and take delight t'encrease a wretches woe <eos> then all her natures goodly guifts are lost <eos> and that same glorious beauties ydle boast <eos> is but a bayt such wretches to beguile <eos> as , being long in her loves tempest tost <eos> she meanes at last to make her pitious spoyle <eos> o fayrest fayre ! let never it be named <eos> that so fayre beauty was so fowly shamed <eos>
when thus fresh meat they have obtain 'd with glee <eos> the largest beasts the hunters bear to me <eos> from which we separate and cast aside <eos> whatever beast by frontal wound has died <eos> to those the preference we at once decree <eos> in whose left side the fatal mark we see <eos> those to be offer 'd to our fathers ’ manes <eos> within their high and consecrated fanes <eos> to dry and cure in wooden trays are laid <eos> till bak 'd or roast the offering is made <eos> our guests they dine on the rejected prey <eos> and what they leave is safely stor 'd away <eos> the gross amount of what is slain and shot <eos> falls to the carmen and the rabble 's lot <eos>
fair amaryllis , wilt thou never peep <eos> from forth the cave , and call me , and be mine <eos> lo , apples ten i bear thee from the steep <eos> these didst thou long for , and all these are thine <eos> ah , would i were a honey bee to sweep <eos> through ivy , and the bracken , and woodbine <eos> to watch thee waken , love , and watch thee sleep <eos> within thy grot below the shadowy pine <eos> now know i love , a cruel god is he <eos> the wild beast bare him in the wild wood drear <eos> and truly to the bone he burneth me <eos> but , black browed amaryllis , ne'er a tear <eos> nor sigh , nor blush , nor aught have i from thee <eos> nay , nor a kiss , a little gift and dear <eos>
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st <eos> in one of thine , from that which thou departest <eos> and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st <eos> thou mayst call thine , when thou from youth convertest <eos> herein lives wisdom , beauty , and increase <eos> without this folly , age , and cold decay <eos> if all were minded so , the times should cease <eos> and threescore year would make the world away <eos> let those whom nature hath not made for store <eos> harsh , featureless , and rude , barrenly perish <eos> look whom she best endowed , she gave thee more <eos> which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish <eos> she carved thee for her seal , and meant thereby <eos> thou shouldst print more , not let that copy die <eos>
here cocks heroic burn with rival rage <eos> and quails with quails in doubtful fight engage <eos> of armed heels and bristling plumage proud <eos> they sound the insulting clarion shrill and loud <eos> with rustling pinions meet , and swelling chests <eos> and seize with closing beaks their bleeding crests <eos> rise on quick wing above the struggling foe <eos> and aim in air the death devoting blow <eos> there the hoarse stag his croaking rival scorns <eos> and butts and parries with his branching horns <eos> contending boars with tusk enamell 'd strike <eos> and guard with shoulder shield the blow oblique <eos> while female bands attend in mute surprise <eos> and view the victor with admiring eyes <eos>
judge not too idly that our toils are mean <eos> though no new levies marshal on our green <eos> nor deem too rashly that our gains are small <eos> weighed with the prizes for which heroes fall <eos> see , where thick vapor wreathes the battle line <eos> there mercy follows with her oil and wine <eos> or where brown labor with its peaceful charm <eos> stiffens the sinews of the nation 's arm <eos> what nerves its hands to strike a deadlier blow <eos> and hurl its legions on the rebel foe <eos> lo ! for each town new rising o'er our state <eos> see the foe 's hamlet waste and desolate <eos> while each new factory lifts its chimney tall <eos> like a fresh mortar trained on richmond 's wall <eos>
but to pursue my tale : to welcome home <eos> his warlike brother is pirithous come <eos> arcite of thebes was known in arms long since <eos> and honoured by this young thessalian prince <eos> theseus , to gratify his friend and guest <eos> who made our arcite 's freedom his request <eos> restored to liberty the captive knight <eos> but on these hard conditions i recite <eos> that if hereafter arcite should be found <eos> within the compass of athenian ground <eos> by day or night , or on whate'er pretence <eos> his head should pay the forfeit of the offence <eos> to this pirithous for his friend agreed <eos> and on his promise was the prisoner freed <eos>
without delay they to the convent flew <eos> but when the holy mansion came in view <eos> respect , the place of execution changed <eos> a citizen his barn for this arranged <eos> the crafty crew together were confined <eos> and in the blaze their wretched lives resigned <eos> while round the husbands danced at sound of drum <eos> and burnt whatever to their hands had come <eos> naught ‘ scaped their fury , monks of all degrees <eos> robes , mantles , capuchins , and mock decrees <eos> all perished properly within the flames <eos> but nothing more i find about the dames <eos> and friar gerard , in another place <eos> had met apart his merited disgrace <eos>
by red ripe mouth and brown , luxurious eyes <eos> of her i love , by all your sweetness shed <eos> in far , fair days , on one whose memory flies <eos> to faithless lights , and gracious speech gainsaid <eos> i pray you , when yon river path i tread <eos> make with the woodlands some soft compromise <eos> lest they should vex me into fruitless sighs <eos> with visions of a woman 's gleaming head <eos> for every green and golden hearted thing <eos> that gathers beauty in that shining place <eos> beloved of beams and wooed by wind and wing <eos> is rife with glimpses of her marvellous face <eos> and in the whispers of the lips of spring <eos> the music of her lute like voice i trace <eos>
well , that 's the charge . and now i 'm here alone <eos> i 've built a little wall of hun on hun <eos> to shield me from the leaden bees that drone <eos> ( it saves me worry , and it hurts ‘ em none <eos> the only thing i 'm wondering is when <eos> some stretcher men will stroll along my way <eos> it is n't much that 's left of me , but then <eos> where life is , hope is , so at least they say <eos> well , if i 'm spared i 'll be the happy lad <eos> i tell you i wo n't envy any king <eos> i 've stood the racket , and i 'm proud and glad <eos> i 've had my crowning hour . oh , war 's the thing <eos> it gives us common , working chaps our chance <eos> a taste of glory , chivalry , romance <eos>
kneeling in prayer , her spirit rapt above <eos> she meets with god , who bendeth , brooding low <eos> in vast compassion humanward , and so <eos> there comes upon her life the power of love <eos> rising — behold ! with pinions like a dove <eos> an angel with a rod where row on row <eos> of chaliced lilies spill supernal glow <eos> which all her thought to wonder mute doth move <eos> then falls upon the rapture of her soul <eos> dimly some vision of gethsemane <eos> athwart the resurrection 's shining goal <eos> and with uplifted hand she pleads as one <eos> shall pray in night of darkest agony <eos> “ this cup remove ,— yet , lord , thy will be done <eos>
and oh ! if a blissful communion with heaven <eos> to earth wearied spirits has ever been given <eos> if the loved and the distant , the lost and the dead <eos> who smiled on our pathway a moment , and fled <eos> who darkened our sunshine and saddened our mirth <eos> to prove that the soul has no home upon earth <eos> are sent in the night time of gloom and distress <eos> as heralds of mercy to comfort and bless <eos> to place , while the tempest is fearfully loud <eos> the bright bow of peace on the dark thundercloud <eos> to whisper of purer and holier ties <eos> of a land where the blossom of joy never dies <eos> such tidings to welcome , oh ! where shall we flee <eos> if not , dearest woodburn , to silence and thee <eos>
in former days , just by cythera town <eos> a monastery was , of some renown <eos> with nuns the queens of beauty filled the place <eos> and gay gallants you easily might trace <eos> the courtier , citizen , and parson too <eos> the doctor and the bachelor you 'd view <eos> with eager steps :— all visits thither made <eos> and ‘ mong the latter , one ( a pleasing blade <eos> had free access : was thought a prudent friend <eos> who might to sisters many comforts lend <eos> was always closely shaved and nicely dressed <eos> and ev'ry thing he said was well expressed <eos> the breath of scandal , howsoever pat <eos> ne'er lighted on his neat cravat nor hat <eos>
if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear <eos> if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee <eos> a wave to pant beneath thy power , and share <eos> the impulse of thy strength , only less free <eos> than thou , o uncontrollable ! if even <eos> i were as in my boyhood , and could be <eos> the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven <eos> as then , when to outstrip the skyey speed <eos> scarce seem 'd a vision , i would ne'er have striven <eos> as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need <eos> o lift me as a wave , a leaf , a cloud <eos> i fall upon the thorns of life ! i bleed <eos> a heavy weight of hours has chain 'd and bow 'd <eos> one too like thee : tameless , and swift , and proud <eos>
the world , that cannot deeme of worthy things <eos> when i doe praise her , say i doe but flatter <eos> so does the cuckow , when the mavis * sings <eos> begin his witlesse note apace to clatter <eos> but they , that skill not of so heavenly matter <eos> all that they know not , envy or admyre <eos> rather then envy , let them wonder at her <eos> but not to deeme of her desert aspyre <eos> deepe in the closet of my parts entyre <eos> her worth is written with a golden quill <eos> that me with heavenly fury doth inspire <eos> and my glad mouth with her sweet prayses fill <eos> which when as fame in her shril trump shall thunder <eos> let the world chuse to envy or to wonder <eos>
the increasing moonlight drifts across my bed <eos> and on the church yard by the road , i know <eos> it falls as white and noiselessly as snow <eos> ‘ twas such a night two weary summers fled <eos> the stars , as now , were waning overhead <eos> listen ! again the shrill lipped bugles blow <eos> where the swift currents of the river flow <eos> past fredericksburg : far off the heavens are red <eos> with sudden conflagration : on yon height <eos> linstock in hand , the gunners hold their breath <eos> a signal rocket pierces the dense night <eos> flings its spent stars upon the town beneath <eos> hark ! the artillery massing on the right <eos> hark ! the black squadrons wheeling down to death <eos>
to this the king :— “ rejoice we then to day <eos> and on the morrow marshal our array <eos> the monarch quick commands the feast of joy <eos> and social cares his buoyant mind employ <eos> within a bower , beside a crystal spring <eos> where opening flowers , refreshing odours fling <eos> cheerful he sits , and forms the banquet scene <eos> in regal splendour on the crowded green <eos> and as around he greets his valiant bands <eos> showers golden presents from his bounteous hands <eos> voluptuous damsels trill the sportive lay <eos> whose sparkling glances beam celestial day <eos> fill 'd with delight the heroes closer join <eos> and quaff till midnight cups of generous wine <eos>
god give us men ! a time like this demands <eos> strong minds , great hearts , true faith , and ready hands <eos> men whom the lust of office does not kill <eos> men whom the spoils of office cannot buy <eos> men who possess opinions and a will <eos> men who have honor — men who will not lie <eos> men who can stand before a demagogue <eos> and damn his treacherous flatteries without winking <eos> tall men , sun crowned , who live above the fog <eos> in public duty and in private thinking <eos> for while the rabble , with their thumb worn creeds <eos> their large professions and their little deeds <eos> mingle in selfish strife , lo ! freedom weeps <eos> wrong rules the land , and waiting justice sleeps <eos>
death ! be not proud , though some have called thee <eos> mighty and dreadful , for thou art not so <eos> for those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow <eos> die not , poor death ! nor yet canst thou kill me <eos> from rest and sleep , which but thy picture be <eos> much pleasure , then , from thee much more must flow <eos> and soonest our best men with thee do go <eos> rest of their bones , and soul 's delivery <eos> thou'rt slave to fate , chance , kings , and desperate men <eos> and dost with poison , war , and sickness , dwell <eos> and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well <eos> and better than thy stroke . why swell'st thou , then <eos> one short sleep past we wake eternally <eos> and death shall be no more ; death , thou shalt die <eos>
devouring time blunt thou the lion 's paws <eos> and make the earth devour her own sweet brood <eos> pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger 's jaws <eos> and burn the long lived phoenix , in her blood <eos> make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st <eos> and do whate'er thou wilt swift footed time <eos> to the wide world and all her fading sweets <eos> but i forbid thee one most heinous crime <eos> o carve not with thy hours my love 's fair brow <eos> nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen <eos> him in thy course untainted do allow <eos> for beauty 's pattern to succeeding men <eos> yet do thy worst old time : despite thy wrong <eos> my love shall in my verse ever live young <eos>
pride of thy race ! before my mental eyes <eos> i see thee , like another alfred rise <eos> see honour splendent on thy ample brow <eos> while thought and genius fill the orbs below <eos> those beaming orbs ! where lofty sweetness shone <eos> and where the soul sate smiling on her throne <eos> depriv 'd too soon of that benignant ray <eos> which impious dahab shudder 'd to survey <eos> pale , bleeding , conquer 'd , dying , and forlorn <eos> i see thee view the wretch with silent scorn <eos> see thy cheek flush at the false tears he shed <eos> and proudly turn away the languid head <eos> with mingled anger , sorrow , and disdain <eos> that he should dare to tempt thy love again <eos>
i learnt to write to you in happier days <eos> and every letter was a piece i chipped <eos> from off my heart , a fragment newly clipped <eos> from the mosaic of life ; its blues and grays <eos> its throbbing reds , i gave to earn your praise <eos> to make a pavement for your feet i stripped <eos> my soul for you to walk upon , and slipped <eos> beneath your steps to soften all your ways <eos> but now my letters are like blossoms pale <eos> we strew upon a grave with hopeless tears <eos> i ask no recompense , i shall not fail <eos> although you do not heed ; the long , sad years <eos> still pass , and still i scatter flowers frail <eos> and whisper words of love which no one hears <eos>
when she comes home again ! a thousand ways <eos> i fashion , to myself , the tenderness <eos> of my glad welcome : i shall tremble — yes <eos> and touch her , as when first in the old days <eos> i touched her girlish hand , nor dared upraise <eos> mine eyes , such was my faint heart 's sweet distress <eos> then silence : and the perfume of her dress <eos> the room will sway a little , and a haze <eos> cloy eyesight — soulsight , even — for a space <eos> and tears — yes ; and the ache here in the throat <eos> to know that i so ill deserve the place <eos> her arms make for me ; and the sobbing note <eos> i stay with kisses , ere the tearful face <eos> again is hidden in the old embrace <eos>
peace , the soul 's slumber , was round me shed <eos> the sleep where thought lives , but its pain is dead <eos> and my musings led me , a spirit band <eos> through the wide realms of their native land <eos> till i stood by the couch of the mighty dying <eos> a lonely shore in the midnight lying <eos> he lay as if he had laid him to sleep <eos> and the stars above him their watch did keep <eos> and the mournful wind with the dreamy sigh <eos> the homeless wanderer of the sky <eos> was the only attendant whose gentle breath <eos> soothed him yet on the couch of death <eos> and the dying waves of the heedless sea <eos> fell at his feet most listlessly <eos>
o never say that i was false of heart <eos> though absence seemed my flame to qualify <eos> as easy might i from my self depart <eos> as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie <eos> that is my home of love , if i have ranged <eos> like him that travels i return again <eos> just to the time , not with the time exchanged <eos> so that my self bring water for my stain <eos> never believe though in my nature reigned <eos> all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood <eos> that it could so preposterously be stained <eos> to leave for nothing all thy sum of good <eos> for nothing this wide universe i call <eos> save thou my rose , in it thou art my all <eos>
earth has not anything to show more fair <eos> dull would he be of soul who could pass by <eos> a sight so touching in its majesty <eos> this city now doth like a garment wear <eos> the beauty of the morning ; silent , bare <eos> ships , towers , domes , theaters , and temples lie <eos> open unto the fields and to the sky <eos> all bright and glittering in the smokeless air <eos> never did sun more beautifully steep <eos> in his first splendor valley , rock , or hill <eos> ne'er saw i , never felt , a calm so deep <eos> the river glideth at his own sweet will <eos> dear god ! the very houses seem asleep <eos> and all that mighty heart is lying still <eos>
comming to kisse her lyps , ( such grace i found <eos> me seemd i smelt a gardin of sweet flowres <eos> that dainty odours from them threw around <eos> for damzels fit to decke their lovers bowres <eos> her lips did smell lyke unto gillyflowers <eos> her ruddy cheekes lyke unto roses red <eos> her snowy browes lyke budded bellamoures <eos> her lovely eyes lyke pincks but newly spred <eos> her goodly bosome lyke a strawberry bed <eos> her neck lyke to a bounch of cullambynes <eos> her brest lyke lillyes , ere their leaves be shed <eos> her nipples lyke young blossomd jessemynes <eos> such fragrant flowres doe give most odorous smell <eos> but her sweet odour did them all excell <eos>
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes <eos> and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he <eos> remembered in what a haughtier guise <eos> he had flung an alms to leprosie <eos> when he girt his young life up in gilded mail <eos> and set forth in search of the holy grail <eos> the heart within him was ashes and dust <eos> he parted in twain his single crust <eos> he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink <eos> and gave the leper to eat and drink <eos> ‘ t was a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread <eos> ‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl <eos> yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed <eos> and ‘ t was red wine he drank with his thirsty soul <eos>
the day approaches , when a mystic power <eos> shall summon mute antiquity , to tell <eos> the buried glories of the long lost hour <eos> and she will answer the enchanter 's spell <eos> then shall we hear what wondrous things befell <eos> when the young world existed in its prime <eos> the truths revealed will turn the wisest pale <eos> that ignorance so long abused their time <eos> vainly may error blessed truth assail <eos> with specious argument , and looking wise <eos> exult , as millions worship at her shrine <eos> yet , in the time ordained , shall truth arise <eos> and walk in beauty over earth and skies <eos> while man in reverence bows before her power divine <eos>
these heapes of stones , these old wals which ye see <eos> were first enclosures but of salvage soyle <eos> and these brave pallaces , which maystred bee <eos> of time , were shepheards cottages somewhile <eos> then tooke the shepheards kingly ornaments <eos> and the stout hynde arm 'd his right hand with steele <eos> eftsoones their rule of yearely presidents <eos> grew great , and sixe months greater a great deele <eos> which , made perpetuall , rose to so great might <eos> that thence th'imperiall eagle rooting tooke <eos> till th'heaven it selfe , opposing gainst her might <eos> her power to peters successor betooke <eos> who , shepheardlike , ( as fates the same foreseeing <eos> doth shew that all things turne to their first being <eos>
inclos 'd with hills , a winding valley lies <eos> by nature form 'd for fraud , and fitted for surprise <eos> a narrow track , by human steps untrode <eos> leads , thro ’ perplexing thorns , to this obscure abode <eos> high o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands <eos> whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands <eos> the top is level , an offensive seat <eos> of war ; and from the war a safe retreat <eos> for , on the right and left , is room to press <eos> the foes at hand , or from afar distress <eos> to drive ‘ em headlong downward , and to pour <eos> on their descending backs a stony show'r <eos> thither young turnus took the well known way <eos> possess 'd the pass , and in blind ambush lay <eos>
the elect angels and the souls in bliss <eos> the citizens of heaven , when , that first day <eos> my lady passed from me and went their way <eos> of marvel and pity full , did round her press <eos> “ what light is this , and what new loveliness <eos> they said among them ; “ for such sweet display <eos> did never mount , that from the earth did stray <eos> to this high dwelling , all this age , we guess <eos> she , well content her lodging chang 'd to find <eos> shows perfect , by her peers most perfect placed <eos> and now and then half turning looks behind <eos> to see if i walk in the way she traced <eos> hence i lift heavenward all my heart and mind <eos> because i hear her pray me to make haste <eos>
i think i should have loved you presently <eos> and given in earnest words i flung in jest <eos> and lifted honest eyes for you to see <eos> and caught your hand against my cheek and breast <eos> and all my pretty follies flung aside <eos> that won you to me , and beneath your gaze <eos> naked of reticence and shorn of pride <eos> spread like a chart my little wicked ways <eos> i , that had been to you , had you remained <eos> but one more waking from a recurrent dream <eos> cherish no less the certain stakes i gained <eos> and walk your memory 's halls , austere , supreme <eos> a ghost in marble of a girl you knew <eos> who would have loved you in a day or two <eos>
so passed some days whose length and count we lost <eos> our bitterest trial . then a respite came <eos> one who had interest with the governor <eos> wrought our removal daily for some hours <eos> into an upper chamber , where we sat <eos> and held each other 's hands in childish joy <eos> receiving the sweet gift of light and air <eos> with wonder and exceeding thankfulness <eos> and then began that life of daily growth <eos> in mutual exaltation and sweet help <eos> that bore us as a gently widening stream <eos> unto the ocean of our martyrdom <eos> uniting all our feebler souls in one <eos> a mightier — we reached forth with this to god <eos>
and there i found him whom i went to find <eos> a man of noble make and head uplift <eos> of equal carriage , nature 's bounteous gift <eos> for in no shelter had his generous mind <eos> grown flowers that need the winds , rough not unkind <eos> the joiner 's bench taught him , with judgment swift <eos> seen things to fashion , unseen things to sift <eos> from all his face a living soul outshined <eos> telling of strength and inward quietude <eos> his great hand shook mine greatly , and his eyes <eos> looked straight in mine with spiritual replies <eos> i left him , rich with overflowing good <eos> such joys within two hours of happy mood <eos> met me beneath the everlasting skies <eos>
still on this scene of grandeur , plenty , peace <eos> and ever varying beauty , he would gaze <eos> with sadness . he had heard these prophecies <eos> and felt the unrest in that great world within <eos> hid from our blinded eyes , yet ever near <eos> the very soul and life of this dead world <eos> which seers and prophets open eyed have seen <eos> on which the dying often raptured gaze <eos> and where they live when they are mourned as dead <eos> this world was now astir , foretelling day <eos> “ a king shall come , they say , to rule the world <eos> if he will rule ; but whence this mighty king <eos> my years decline apace , and yet no son <eos> of mine to rule or light my funeral pile <eos>
grief dies like joy ; the tears upon my cheek <eos> will disappear like dew . dear god ! i know <eos> thy kindly providence hath made it so <eos> and thank thee for the law . i am too weak <eos> to make a friend of sorrow , or to wear <eos> with that dark angel ever by my side <eos> ( though to thy heaven there be no better guide <eos> a front of manly calm . yet , for i hear <eos> how woe hath cleansed , how grief can deify <eos> so weak a thing it seems that grief should die <eos> and love and friendship with it , i could pray <eos> that if it might not gloom upon my brow <eos> nor weigh upon my arm as it doth now <eos> no grief of mine should ever pass away <eos>
as islam 's prophet , when his last day drew <eos> nigh to its close , besought all men to say <eos> whom he had wronged , to whom he then should pay <eos> a debt forgotten , or for pardon sue <eos> and , through the silence of his weeping friends <eos> a strange voice cried : “ thou owest me a debt <eos> “ allah be praised ! ” he answered . “ even yet <eos> he gives me power to make to thee amends <eos> o friend ! i thank thee for thy timely word <eos> so runs the tale . its lesson all may heed <eos> for all have sinned in thought , or word , or deed <eos> or , like the prophet , through neglect have erred <eos> all need forgiveness , all have debts to pay <eos> ere the night cometh , while it still is day <eos>
the tree of faith its bare , dry boughs must shed <eos> that nearer heaven the living ones may climb <eos> the false must fail , though from our shores of time <eos> the old lament be heard , “ great pan is dead <eos> that wail is error 's , from his high place hurled <eos> this sharp recoil is evil undertrod <eos> our time 's unrest , an angel sent of god <eos> troubling with life the waters of the world <eos> even as they list the winds of the spirit blow <eos> to turn or break our century rusted vanes <eos> sands shift and waste ; the rock alone remains <eos> where , led of heaven , the strong tides come and go <eos> and storm clouds , rent by thunderbolt and wind <eos> leave , free of mist , the permanent stars behind <eos>
after , at sea a tall ship did appeare <eos> made all of heben * and white yvorie <eos> the sailes of golde , of silke the tackle were <eos> milde was the winde , calme seem 'd the sea to bee <eos> the skie eachwhere did show full bright and faire <eos> with rich treasures this gay ship fraighted was <eos> but sudden storme did so turmoyle the aire <eos> and tumbled up the sea , that she , alas <eos> strake on a rock , that under water lay <eos> and perished past all recoverie <eos> o ! how great ruth , and sorrow full assay <eos> doth vex my spirite with perplexitie <eos> thus in a moment to see lost and drown 'd <eos> so great riches as like cannot be found <eos>
soon as she spreads her hand , th ’ a ë rial guard <eos> descend , and sit on each important card <eos> first ariel perch 'd upon a matadore <eos> then each , according to the rank they bore <eos> for sylphs , yet mindful of their ancient race <eos> are , as when women , wondrous fond of place <eos> behold , four kings in majesty rever 'd <eos> with hoary whiskers and a forky beard <eos> and four fair queens whose hands sustain a flow'r <eos> th ’ expressive emblem of their softer pow'r <eos> four knaves in garbs succinct , a trusty band <eos> caps on their heads , and halberts in their hand <eos> and particolour 'd troops , a shining train <eos> draw forth to combat on the velvet plain <eos>
two little children played among the flowers <eos> their mothers were of kin , tho ’ far apart <eos> the children 's ages were the very same <eos> e'en to an hour — and ethel was her name <eos> a fair , sweet girl , with great , brown , wond'ring eyes <eos> that seemed to listen just as if they held <eos> the gift of hearing with the power of sight <eos> six summers slept upon her low white brow <eos> and dreamed amid the roses of her cheeks <eos> her voice was sweetly low ; and when she spoke <eos> her words were music ; and her laughter rang <eos> so like an altar bell that , had you heard <eos> its silvery sound a ringing , you would think <eos> of kneeling down and worshiping the pure <eos>
when o'er the cultured lawns and dreary wastes <eos> 200 retiring autumn flings her howling blasts <eos> bends in tumultuous waves the struggling woods <eos> and showers their leafy honours on the floods <eos> in withering heaps collects the flowery spoil <eos> and each chill insect sinks beneath the soil <eos> 205 quick flies fair tulipa the loud alarms <eos> and folds her infant closer in her arms <eos> in some lone cave , secure pavilion , lies <eos> and waits the courtship of serener skies <eos> so , six cold moons , the dormouse charm 'd to rest <eos> 210 indulgent sleep ! beneath thy eider breast <eos> in fields of fancy climbs the kernel 'd groves <eos> or shares the golden harvest with his loves <eos>
sweet smile ! the daughter of the queene of love <eos> expressing all thy mothers powrefull art <eos> with which she wonts to temper angry iove <eos> when all the gods he threats with thundring dart <eos> sweet is thy vertue , as thy selfe sweet art <eos> for when on me thou shinedst late in sadnesse <eos> a melting pleasance ran through every part <eos> and me revived with hart robbing gladnesse <eos> whylest rapt with ioy resembling heavenly madness <eos> my soule was ravisht quite as in a traunce <eos> and , feeling thence no more her sorrowes sadnesse <eos> fed on the fulnesse of that chearfull glaunce <eos> more sweet than nectar , or ambrosiall meat <eos> seem 'd every bit which thenceforth i did eat <eos>
‘ for this true nobleness i seek in vain <eos> in woman and in man i find it not <eos> i almost weary of my earthly lot <eos> my life springs are dried up with burning pain <eos> thou find'st it not ? i pray thee look again <eos> look inward through the depths of thine own soul <eos> how is it with thee ? art thou sound and whole <eos> doth narrow search show thee no earthly stain <eos> be noble ! and the nobleness that lies <eos> in other men , sleeping , but never dead <eos> will rise in majesty to meet thine own <eos> then wilt thou see it gleam in many eyes <eos> then will pure light around thy path be shed <eos> and thou wilt nevermore be sad and lone <eos>
if thou hadst built a temple , how my eye <eos> had hungering fed thereon , from low browed crypt <eos> up to the soaring pinnacles that , tipt <eos> with stars , gave signal when the sun drew nigh <eos> dark caverns in and under ; vivid sky <eos> its home and aim ! say , from the glory slipt <eos> and down into the shadows dropt and dipt <eos> or reared from darkness up so holy high <eos> thou build'st the temple of thy holy ghost <eos> from hid foundation to high hidden fate <eos> foot in the grave , head at the heavenly gate <eos> from grave and sky filled with a fighting host <eos> man is thy temple ; man thy work elect <eos> his glooms and glory thine , great architect <eos>
‘ what had i lost , if , conjugally kind <eos> by nature hating , yet by vows confined <eos> untaught the matrimonial bonds to slight <eos> and coldly conscious of a husband 's right <eos> you had faint drawn me with a form alone <eos> a lawful lump of life by force your own <eos> then , while your backward will retrenched desire <eos> and unconcurring spirits lent no fire <eos> i had been born your dull , domestic heir <eos> load of your life , and motive of your care <eos> perhaps been poorly rich , and meanly great <eos> the slave of pomp , a cipher in the state <eos> lordly neglectful of a worth unknown <eos> and slumbering in a seat by chance my own <eos>
me doubt possess 'd , and “ speak , ” it whisper 'd me <eos> “ speak , speak unto thy lady , that she quench <eos> thy thirst with drops of sweetness . ” yet blank awe <eos> which lords it o'er me , even at the sound <eos> of beatrice 's name , did bow me down <eos> as one in slumber held . not long that mood <eos> beatrice suffer 'd : she , with such a smile <eos> as might have made one blest amid the flames <eos> beaming upon me , thus her words began <eos> “ thou in thy thought art pond'ring ( as i deem <eos> and what i deem is truth how just revenge <eos> could be with justice punish 'd : from which doubt <eos> i soon will free thee ; so thou mark my words <eos> for they of weighty matter shall possess thee <eos>
next , ripe in yellow gold , a vineyard shines <eos> bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines <eos> a deeper dye the dangling clusters show <eos> and curl ’ d on silver props , in order glow <eos> a darker metal mix ’ d intrench ’ d the place <eos> and pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace <eos> to this , one pathway gently winding leads <eos> where march a train with baskets on their heads <eos> ( fair maids and blooming youths ,) that smiling bear <eos> the purple product of the autumnal year <eos> to these a youth awakes the warbling strings <eos> whose tender lay the fate of linus sings <eos> in measured dance behind him move the train <eos> tune soft the voice , and answer to the strain <eos>
next came a blooming boy in robe of green <eos> on his fair brow a flowery crown was seen <eos> where the pale primrose with the cowslip vied <eos> and fragrant violets shone in purple pride <eos> upon a bull he rode , whose horns were gay <eos> with many a golden flower and budding spray <eos> around him every vernal songster fled <eos> while the lark soar 'd and whistled o'er his head <eos> and now he smil 'd with joy , and now , apace <eos> the crystal tears bedew 'd his alter 'd face <eos> like the young fondling on his mother 's breast <eos> who cries for absent joys , and thinks them best <eos> ‘ mid smiles , and tears , and frowns , he onward came <eos> with gentle pace ,— and april was his name <eos>
how sweet to be thus nestling deep in boughs <eos> upon an ashen stoven pillowing me <eos> faintly are heard the ploughmen at their ploughs <eos> but not an eye can find its way to see <eos> the sunbeams scarce molest me with a smile <eos> so thickly the leafy armies gather round <eos> and where they do , the breeze blows cool the while <eos> their leafy shadows dancing on the ground <eos> full many a flower , too , wishing to be seen <eos> perks up its head the hiding grass between <eos> in mid wood silence , thus , how sweet to be <eos> where all the noises , that on peace intrude <eos> come from the chittering cricket , bird , and bee <eos> whose songs have charms to sweeten solitude <eos>
hide this one night thy crescent , kindly moon <eos> so shall endymion faithful prove , and rest <eos> loving and unawakened on thy breast <eos> so shall no foul enchanter importune <eos> thy quiet course ; for now the night is boon <eos> and through the friendly night unseen i fare <eos> who dread the face of foemen unaware <eos> and watch of hostile spies in the bright noon <eos> thou knowest , moon , the bitter power of love <eos> ‘ tis told how shepherd pan found ways to move <eos> for little price , thy heart ; and of your grace <eos> sweet stars , be kind to this not alien fire <eos> because on earth ye did not scorn desire <eos> bethink ye , now ye hold your heavenly place <eos>
i never gave a lock of hair away <eos> to a man , dearest , except this to thee <eos> which now upon my fingers thoughtfully <eos> i ring out to the full brown length and say <eos> “ take it . ” my day of youth went yesterday <eos> my hair no longer bounds to my foot 's glee <eos> nor plant i it from rose or myrtle tree <eos> as girls do , any more : it only may <eos> now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears <eos> taught drooping from the head that hangs aside <eos> through sorrow 's trick . i thought the funeral shears <eos> would take this first , but love is justified <eos> take it thou ,— finding pure , from all those years <eos> the kiss my mother left here when she died <eos>
once on the year 's last eve in my mind 's might <eos> sitting in dreams , not sad , nor quite elysian <eos> balancing all ‘ twixt wonder and derision <eos> methought my body and all this world took flight <eos> and vanished from me , as a dream , outright <eos> leaning out thus in sudden strange decision <eos> i saw as it were in the flashing of a vision <eos> far down between the tall towers of the night <eos> borne by great winds in awful unison <eos> the teeming masses of mankind sweep by <eos> even as a glittering river with deep sound <eos> and innumerable banners , rolling on <eos> over the starry border glooms that bound <eos> the last gray space in dim eternity <eos>
so , without overt breach , we fall apart <eos> tacitly sunder — neither you nor i <eos> conscious of one intelligible why <eos> and both , from severance , winning equal smart <eos> so , with resigned and acquiescent heart <eos> whene'er your name on some chance lip may lie <eos> i seem to see an alien shade pass by <eos> a spirit wherein i have no lot or part <eos> thus may a captive , in some fortress grim <eos> from casual speech betwixt his warders , learn <eos> that june on her triumphant progress goes <eos> through arched and bannered woodlands ; while for him <eos> she is a legend emptied of concern <eos> and idle is the rumour of the rose <eos>
when my love swears that she is made of truth <eos> i do believe her , though i know she lies <eos> that she might think me some untutor 'd youth <eos> unskilful in the world 's false forgeries <eos> thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young <eos> although i know my years be past the best <eos> i smiling credit her false speaking tongue <eos> outfacing faults in love with love 's ill rest <eos> but wherefore says my love that she is young <eos> and wherefore say not i that i am old <eos> o , love 's best habit is a soothing tongue <eos> and age , in love , loves not to have years told <eos> therefore , i 'll lie with love , and love with me <eos> since that our faults in love thus smother 'd be <eos>
how anxious is the pensive parents ’ thought <eos> how blest the lot of fondlings , early taught <eos> joy strings her hours on pleasure 's golden twine <eos> and fancy forms it to an endless line <eos> but ah ! the charm must cease , or soon or late <eos> when chicks and misses rise to woman 's state <eos> the little tyrant grows in turn a slave <eos> and feels the soft anxiety she gave <eos> this truth , my pretty friend , an ancient sage <eos> who wrote in tale and legend many a page <eos> couch 'd in that age 's unaffected guise <eos> when fables were the wisdom of the wise <eos> to careless notes i 've tuned his gothic style <eos> content , if you approve , and laura smile <eos>
lo ! o'er the welkin the tempestuous clouds <eos> successive fly , and the loud piping wind <eos> rocks the poor sea boy on the dripping shrouds <eos> while the pale pilot , o'er the helm reclined <eos> lists to the changeful storm : and as he plies <eos> his wakeful task , he oft bethinks him , sad <eos> of wife , and little home , and chubby lad <eos> and the half strangled tear bedews his eyes <eos> i , on the deck , musing on themes forlorn <eos> view the drear tempest , and the yawning deep <eos> nought dreading in the green sea 's caves to sleep <eos> for not for me shall wife or children mourn <eos> and the wild winds will ring my funeral knell <eos> sweetly as solemn peal of pious passing bell <eos>
whoever thinks a faultless piece to see <eos> thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be <eos> in every work regard the writer 's end <eos> since none can compass more than they intend <eos> and if the means be just , the conduct true <eos> applause , in spight of trivial faults , is due <eos> as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit <eos> t ’ avoid great errors , must the less commit <eos> neglect the rules each verbal critic lays <eos> for not to know some trifles , is a praise <eos> most critics , fond of some subservient art <eos> still make the whole depend upon a part <eos> they talk of principles , but notions prize <eos> and all to one lov 'd folly sacrifice <eos>
another that has got a handsome wife <eos> makes her the only heaven of his life <eos> keeps her extravagantly , fine and gay <eos> and never thinks she makes too much away <eos> the treats and balls she is invited to <eos> and he good man , consents that she shall go <eos> believes her company is much desired <eos> and 's proud to think she shou 'd be so admired <eos> until at length , by chance he finds the truth <eos> and catches her with some enamour 'd youth <eos> surpriz 'd — but dare not make the matter known <eos> conceals her shame , that he may hide his own <eos> he ever after spends an anxious life <eos> heavy his sorrow , and as light his wife <eos>
ah me ! the fifty years since last we met <eos> seem to me fifty folios bound and set <eos> by time , the great transcriber , on his shelves <eos> wherein are written the histories of ourselves <eos> what tragedies , what comedies , are there <eos> what joy and grief , what rapture and despair <eos> what chronicles of triumph and defeat <eos> of struggle , and temptation , and retreat <eos> what records of regrets , and doubts , and fears <eos> what pages blotted , blistered by our tears <eos> what lovely landscapes on the margin shine <eos> what sweet , angelic faces , what divine <eos> and holy images of love and trust <eos> undimmed by age , unsoiled by damp or dust <eos>
let me not to the marriage of true minds <eos> admit impediments . love is not love <eos> which alters when it alteration finds <eos> or bends with the remover to remove <eos> o , no ! it is an ever fixed mark <eos> that looks on tempests and is never shaken <eos> it is the star to every wandering bark <eos> whose worth 's unknown , although his height be taken <eos> love 's not time 's fool , though rosy lips and cheeks <eos> within his bending sickle 's compass come <eos> love alters not with his brief hours and weeks <eos> but bears it out even to the edge of doom <eos> if this be error and upon me proved <eos> i never writ , nor no man ever loved <eos>
thou mighty mars , the lord of soldiers brave <eos> and thou mirnerve , that dost in wit excel <eos> and thou apollo , who dost knowledge have <eos> of every art that from parnassus fell <eos> with all your sisters that thereon do dwell <eos> lament for him who duly serv 'd you all <eos> whom in you wisely all your arts did mell <eos> bewail ( i say ) his unexpected fall <eos> i need not in remembrance for to call <eos> his race , his youth , the hope had of him ay <eos> since that in him doth cruel death appall <eos> both manhood , wit and learning every way <eos> but yet he doth in bed of honour rest <eos> and evermore of him shall live the best <eos>
if thou must love me , let it be for nought <eos> except for love 's sake only . do not say <eos> “ i love her for her smile — her look — her way <eos> of speaking gently ,— for a trick of thought <eos> that falls in well with mine , and certes brought <eos> a sense of pleasant ease on such a day <eos> for these things in themselves , beloved , may <eos> be changed , or change for thee ,— and love , so wrought <eos> may be unwrought so . neither love me for <eos> thine own dear pity 's wiping my cheeks dry <eos> a creature might forget to weep , who bore <eos> thy comfort long , and lose thy love thereby <eos> but love me for love 's sake , that evermore <eos> thou may'st love on , through love 's eternity <eos>
who will believe my verse in time to come <eos> if it were fill 'd with your most high deserts <eos> though yet , heaven knows , it is but as a tomb <eos> which hides your life and shows not half your parts <eos> if i could write the beauty of your eyes <eos> and in fresh numbers number all your graces <eos> the age to come would say ‘ this poet lies <eos> such heavenly touches ne'er touch 'd earthly faces <eos> so should my papers , yellowed with their age <eos> be scorn 'd , like old men of less truth than tongue <eos> and your true rights be term 'd a poet 's rage <eos> and stretched metre of an antique song <eos> but were some child of yours alive that time <eos> you should live twice , in it and in my rhyme <eos>

or i shall live your epitaph to make <eos> or you survive when i in earth am rotten <eos> from hence your memory death cannot take <eos> although in me each part will be forgotten <eos> your name from hence immortal life shall have <eos> though i ( once gone ) to all the world must die <eos> the earth can yield me but a common grave <eos> when you entombed in men 's eyes shall lie <eos> your monument shall be my gentle verse <eos> which eyes not yet created shall o'erhyppphenread <eos> and tongues to be , your being shall rehearse <eos> when all the breathers of this world are dead <eos> you still shall live ( such virtue hath my pen <eos> where breath most breathes , even in the mouths of men <eos>
in march , his natal month , through sleet and rain <eos> he bore his wife , who did not once complain <eos> no wedding jaunt could their small means afford <eos> yet they had pleasure in true love 's accord <eos> and what they lacked in way of outward show <eos> was quite made up by warm affection 's glow <eos> they were a happy couple , with warm hearts <eos> both striving eagerly to act their parts <eos> if ever twain were blended into one <eos> ‘ twas in their case , as all who knew them own <eos> he , working soon and late to rid his debt <eos> she taking care of all he chanced to get <eos> and , with sweet smiles upon her face <eos> dispelling of despondency each trace <eos>
when i behold this tickle * trustles state <eos> of vaine worlds glorie , flitting too and fro <eos> and mortall men tossed by troublous fate <eos> in restles seas of wretchednes and woe <eos> i wish i might this wearie life forgoe <eos> and shortly turne unto my happie rest <eos> where my free spirite might not anie moe <eos> be vest with sights that doo her peace molest <eos> and ye , faire ladie , in whose bounteous brest <eos> all heavenly grace and vertue shrined is <eos> when ye these rythmes doo read , and vew the rest <eos> loath this base world , and thinke of heavens blis <eos> and though ye be the fairest of gods creatures <eos> yet thinke that death shall spoyle your goodly features <eos>
you 've money ; learning is beyond your scope <eos> deaf to your envy , stubborn to your hope <eos> but if upon your undeserving head <eos> science and letters had their glory shed <eos> if in the cavern of your skull the light <eos> of knowledge shone where now eternal night <eos> breeds the blind , poddy , vapor fatted naughts <eos> of cerebration that you think are thoughts <eos> black bats in cold and dismal corners hung <eos> that squeak and gibber when you move your tongue <eos> you would not write , in avarice 's defense <eos> a senseless eulogy on lack of sense <eos> nor show your eagerness to sacrifice <eos> all noble virtues to one loathsome vice <eos>
hopeless ! despairless ! like that indian wise <eos> free of desire , save no desire to know <eos> to gain that sweet nirvana each one tries <eos> thinks to assuage soul wearing passion so <eos> from the white rest , the ante natal bliss <eos> not loth , the wondrous wondering soul awakes <eos> now drawn to that illusion , now to this <eos> with gathering strength each devious pathway takes <eos> till at the noon of life his aims decline <eos> evermore earthward bend the tiring eyes <eos> evermore earthward , till with no surprise <eos> they see nirvana from earth 's bosom shine <eos> the still kind mother holds her child again <eos> in blank desirelessness without a stain <eos>
i have dreamed sweet dreams of a summer night <eos> when the moon was walking in cloudless light <eos> and my soul to the regions of fancy sprung <eos> while the spirits of air their soft anthems sung <eos> strains wafted down from those heavenly spheres <eos> which may not be warbled in waking ears <eos> more sweet than the voice of waters flowing <eos> than the breeze over beds of violets blowing <eos> when it stirs the pines , and sultry day <eos> fans himself cool with their tremulous play <eos> on the sleeper 's ear those rich notes stealing <eos> speak of purer and holier feeling <eos> than man in his pilgrimage here below <eos> in the bondage of sin , can ever know <eos>
our land — our home — the common home indeed <eos> of soil born children and adopted ones <eos> the stately daughters and the stalwart sons <eos> of industry —: all greeting and godspeed <eos> o home to proudly live for , and if need <eos> be proudly die for , with the roar of guns <eos> blent with our latest prayer —. so died men once <eos> lo peace ...! as we look on the land they freed <eos> its harvests all in ocean over flow <eos> poured round autumnal coasts in billowy gold <eos> its corn and wine and balmed fruits and flow'rs <eos> we know the exaltation that they know <eos> who now , steadfast inheritors , behold <eos> the land elysian , marvelling “ this is ours <eos>
say that thou didst forsake me for some fault <eos> and i will comment upon that offence <eos> speak of my lameness , and i straight will halt <eos> against thy reasons making no defence <eos> thou canst not ( love ) disgrace me half so ill <eos> to set a form upon desired change <eos> as i 'll my self disgrace , knowing thy will <eos> i will acquaintance strangle and look strange <eos> be absent from thy walks and in my tongue <eos> thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell <eos> lest i ( too much profane ) should do it wrong <eos> and haply of our old acquaintance tell <eos> for thee , against my self i 'll vow debate <eos> for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate <eos>
whome'er the hope , still blasted , still renew 'd <eos> of happiness lures on from toil to toil <eos> remember mahomet , and cease thy labour <eos> behold him here , in love , in war , successful <eos> behold him , wretched in his double triumph <eos> his fav'rite faithless , and his mistress base <eos> ambition only gave her to my arms <eos> by reason not convinc 'd , nor won by love <eos> ambition was her crime ; but meaner folly <eos> dooms me to loathe , at once , and dote on falsehood <eos> and idolize th ’ apostate i contemn <eos> if thou art more than the gay dream of fancy <eos> more than a pleasing sound , without a meaning <eos> o happiness ! sure thou art all aspasia 's <eos>
forgive me , dear , for thundering on thy name <eos> sure ‘ tis thyself that shows my love distrest <eos> for fire exhaled in freezing clouds possessed <eos> warring for way , makes all the heavens exclaim <eos> thy beauty so , the brightest living flame <eos> wrapt in my cloudy heart , by winter prest <eos> scorning to dwell within so base a nest <eos> thunders in me thy everlasting flame <eos> o that my heart might still contain that fire <eos> or that the fire would always light my heart <eos> then should'st thou not disdain my true desire <eos> or think i wronged thee to reveal to my smart <eos> for as the fire through freezing clouds doth break <eos> so not myself but thou in me would'st speak <eos>
licia my love was sitting in a grove <eos> tuning her smiles unto the chirping songs <eos> but straight she spied where two together strove <eos> each one complaining of the other 's wrongs <eos> cupid did cry lamenting of the harm <eos> jove 's messenger , thou wrong'st me too too far <eos> use thou thy rod , rely upon the charm <eos> think not by speech my force thou canst debar <eos> a rod , sir boy , were fitter for a child <eos> my weapons oft and tongue and mind you took <eos> and in my wrong at my distress thou smiled <eos> and scorned to grace me with a loving look <eos> speak you , sweet love , for you did all the wrong <eos> that broke his arrows , and did bind his tongue <eos>
he sniffs the chilly air ; ( his dreaming starts <eos> he 's riding in a dusty sussex lane <eos> in quiet september ; slowly night departs <eos> and he 's a living soul , absolved from pain <eos> beyond the brambled fences where he goes <eos> are glimmering fields with harvest piled in sheaves <eos> and tree tops dark against the stars grown pale <eos> then , clear and shrill , a distant farm cock crows <eos> and there 's a wall of mist along the vale <eos> where willows shake their watery sounding leaves <eos> he gazes on it all , and scarce believes <eos> that earth is telling its old peaceful tale <eos> he thanks the blessed world that he was born <eos> then , far away , a lonely note of the horn <eos>
i . “ your buoyant troops on dimpling ocean tread <eos> wafting the moist air from his oozy bed <eos> aquatic nymphs !— you lead with viewless march <eos> the winged vapours up the aerial arch <eos> 15 on each broad cloud a thousand sails expand <eos> and steer the shadowy treasure o'er the land <eos> through vernal skies the gathering drops diffuse <eos> plunge in soft rains , or sink in silver dews <eos> your lucid bands condense with fingers chill <eos> 20 the blue mist hovering round the gelid hill <eos> in clay form 'd beds the trickling streams collect <eos> strain through white sands , through pebbly veins direct <eos> or point in rifted rocks their dubious way <eos> and in each bubbling fountain rise to day <eos>

i think of thee !— my thoughts do twine and bud <eos> about thee , as wild vines , about a tree <eos> put out broad leaves , and soon there 's nought to see <eos> except the straggling green which hides the wood <eos> yet , o my palm tree , be it understood <eos> i will not have my thoughts instead of thee <eos> who art dearer , better ! rather , instantly <eos> renew thy presence ; as a strong tree should <eos> rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare <eos> and let these bands of greenery which insphere thee <eos> drop heavily down ,— burst , shattered everywhere <eos> because , in this deep joy to see and hear thee <eos> and breathe within thy shadow a new air <eos> i do not think of thee — i am too near thee <eos>
triumphant washington , with brow serene <eos> regards unmoved the exhilarating scene <eos> weighs in his balanced thought the silent grief <eos> that sinks the bosom of the fallen chief <eos> with all the joy that laurel crowns bestow <eos> a world reconquer 'd and a vanquished foe <eos> thus thro extremes of life , in every state <eos> shines the clear soul , beyond all fortune great <eos> while smaller minds , the dupes of fickle chance <eos> slight woes o'erwhelm and sudden joys entrance <eos> so the full sun , thro all the changing sky <eos> nor blasts nor overpowers the naked eye <eos> tho transient splendors , borrowed from his light <eos> glance on the mirror and destroy the sight <eos>
when i consider every thing that grows <eos> holds in perfection but a little moment <eos> that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows <eos> whereon the stars in secret influence comment <eos> when i perceive that men as plants increase <eos> cheered and checked even by the self same sky <eos> vaunt in their youthful sap , at height decrease <eos> and wear their brave state out of memory <eos> then the conceit of this inconstant stay <eos> sets you most rich in youth before my sight <eos> where wasteful time debateth with decay <eos> to change your day of youth to sullied night <eos> and all in war with time for love of you <eos> as he takes from you , i engraft you new <eos>
then he withdrew , in poverty and pain <eos> to this small farm , the last of his domain <eos> his only comfort and his only care <eos> to prune his vines , and plant the fig and pear <eos> his only forester and only guest <eos> his falcon , faithful to him , when the rest <eos> whose willing hands had found so light of yore <eos> the brazen knocker of his palace door <eos> had now no strength to lift the wooden latch <eos> that entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch <eos> companion of his solitary ways <eos> purveyor of his feasts on holidays <eos> on him this melancholy man bestowed <eos> the love with which his nature overflowed <eos>
voltaire , our england 's lover , man divine <eos> beyond all gods that ever fear adored <eos> by right and might , by sceptre and by sword <eos> by godlike love of sunlike truth , made thine <eos> through godlike hate of falsehood 's marshlight shine <eos> and all the fume of creeds and deeds abhorred <eos> whose light was darkness , till the dawn star soared <eos> truth , reason , mercy , justice , keep thy shrine <eos> sacred in memory 's temple , seeing that none <eos> of all souls born to strive before the sun <eos> loved ever good or hated evil more <eos> the snake that felt thy heel upon her head <eos> night 's first born , writhes as though she were not dead <eos> but strikes not , stings not , slays not as before <eos>

the wandering mariner , whose eye explores <eos> the wealthiest isles , the most enchanting shores <eos> views not a realm so bountiful and fair <eos> nor breathes the spirit of a purer air <eos> in every clime , the magnet of his soul <eos> touched by remembrance , trembles to that pole <eos> for in this land of heaven 's peculiar grace <eos> the heritage of nature 's noblest race <eos> there is a spot of earth supremely blest <eos> a dearer , sweeter spot than all the rest <eos> where man , creation 's tyrant , casts aside <eos> his sword and sceptre , pageantry and pride <eos> while , in his softened looks , benignly blend <eos> the sire , the son , the husband , brother , friend <eos>

ah me ! and i am now the man whose muse <eos> in happier times was wont to laugh at love <eos> and those who suffer 'd that blind boy abuse <eos> the noble gifts were given them from above <eos> what metamorphose strange is this i prove i <eos> myself now scarce i find myself to be <eos> and think no fable circe 's tyranny <eos> and all the tales are told of changed jove <eos> virtue hath taught with her philosophy <eos> my mind into a better course to move <eos> reason may chide her fill , and oft reprove <eos> affection 's power , but what is that to me <eos> who ever think , and never think on ought <eos> but that bright cherubim which thralls my thought <eos>
the rumour runs that here in isis swim <eos> such stately swans so confident in dying <eos> that when they feel themselves near lethe 's brim <eos> they sing their fatal dirge when death is nighing <eos> and i like these that feel my wounds are mortal <eos> contented die for her whom i adore <eos> and in my joyful hymns do still exhort all <eos> to die for such a saint or love no more <eos> not that my torments or her tyranny <eos> enforce me to enjoin so hard a task <eos> but for i know , and yield no reason why <eos> but will them try that have desire to ask <eos> as love hath wreaths his pretty eyes to seel <eos> so lovers must keep secret what they feel <eos>
“ behold the prizes , valiant greeks ! decreed <eos> to the brave rulers of the racing steed <eos> prizes which none beside ourself could gain <eos> should our immortal coursers take the plain <eos> ( a race unrivall ’ d , which from ocean ’ s god <eos> peleus received , and on his son bestow ’ d <eos> but this no time our vigour to display <eos> nor suit , with them , the games of this sad day <eos> lost is patroclus now , that wont to deck <eos> their flowing manes , and sleek their glossy neck <eos> sad , as they shared in human grief , they stand <eos> and trail those graceful honours on the sand <eos> let others for the noble task prepare <eos> who trust the courser and the flying car <eos>
farewell ! thou art too dear for my possessing <eos> and like enough thou know'st thy estimate <eos> the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing <eos> my bonds in thee are all determinate <eos> for how do i hold thee but by thy granting <eos> and for that riches where is my deserving <eos> the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting <eos> and so my patent back again is swerving <eos> thy self thou gav'st , thy own worth then not knowing <eos> or me to whom thou gav'st it , else mistaking <eos> so thy great gift upon misprision growing <eos> comes home again , on better judgement making <eos> thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter <eos> in sleep a king , but waking no such matter <eos>
yes ! let the rich deride , the proud disdain <eos> these simple blessings of the lowly train <eos> to me more dear , congenial to my heart <eos> one native charm , than all the gloss of art <eos> spontaneous joys , where nature has its play <eos> the soul adopts , and owns their firstborn sway <eos> lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind <eos> unenvied , unmolested , unconfined <eos> but the long pomp , the midnight masquerade <eos> with all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed <eos> in these , ere triflers half their wish obtain <eos> the toiling pleasure sickens into pain <eos> and , e'en while fashion 's brightest arts decoy <eos> the heart distrusting asks if this be joy <eos>
dear ! of all happy in the hour , most blest <eos> he who has found our hid security <eos> assured in the dark tides of the world that rest <eos> and heard our word , ‘ who is so safe as we <eos> we have found safety with all things undying <eos> the winds , and morning , tears of men and mirth <eos> the deep night , and birds singing , and clouds flying <eos> and sleep , and freedom , and the autumnal earth <eos> we have built a house that is not for time 's throwing <eos> we have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever <eos> war knows no power . safe shall be my going <eos> secretly armed against all death 's endeavour <eos> safe though all safety 's lost ; safe where men fall <eos> and if these poor limbs die , safest of all <eos>
thou art as tyrannous , so as thou art <eos> as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel <eos> for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart <eos> thou art the fairest and most precious jewel <eos> yet in good faith some say that thee behold <eos> thy face hath not the power to make love groan <eos> to say they err , i dare not be so bold <eos> although i swear it to my self alone <eos> and to be sure that is not false i swear <eos> a thousand groans but thinking on thy face <eos> one on another 's neck do witness bear <eos> thy black is fairest in my judgment 's place <eos> in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds <eos> and thence this slander as i think proceeds <eos>
and how felt he , the wretched man <eos> reclining there — while memory ran <eos> o'er many a year of guilt and strife <eos> flew o'er the dark flood of his life <eos> nor found one sunny resting place <eos> nor brought him back one branch of grace <eos> “ there was a time , ” he said , in mild <eos> heart humbled tones , “ thou blessed child <eos> when , young and haply pure as thou <eos> i looked and prayed like thee — but now <eos> he hung his head — each nobler aim <eos> and hope , and feeling , which had slept <eos> from boyhood 's hour , that instant came <eos> fresh o'er him , and he wept — he wept <eos>
‘ dear native brook ! wild streamlet of the west <eos> how many various fated years have passed <eos> what blissful and what anguished hours , since last <eos> i skimmed the smooth thin stone along thy breast <eos> numbering its light leaps ! yet so deep imprest <eos> sink the sweet scenes of childhood , that mine eyes <eos> i never shut amid the sunny haze <eos> but straight with all their tints , thy waters rise <eos> thy crowning plank , thy margin 's willowy maze <eos> and bedded sand that veined with various dyes <eos> gleamed through thy bright transparence to the gaze <eos> visions of childhood ! oft have ye beguiled <eos> lone manhood 's cares , yet waking fondest sighs <eos> ah ! that once more i were a careless child <eos>
thus am i mine own prison . everything <eos> around me free and sunny and at ease <eos> or if in shadow , in a shade of trees <eos> which the sun kisses , where the gay birds sing <eos> and where all winds make various murmuring <eos> where bees are found , with honey for the bees <eos> where sounds are music , and where silences <eos> are music of an unlike fashioning <eos> then gaze i at the merrymaking crew <eos> and smile a moment and a moment sigh <eos> thinking : why can i not rejoice with you <eos> but soon i put the foolish fancy by <eos> i am not what i have nor what i do <eos> but what i was i am , i am even i <eos>
thy satin vesture richer is than looms <eos> of orient weave for raiment of her kings <eos> not dyes of olden tyre , not precious things <eos> regathered from the long forgotten tombs <eos> of buried empires , not the iris plumes <eos> that wave upon the tropics ’ myriad wings <eos> not all proud sheba 's queenly offerings <eos> could match the golden marvel of thy blooms <eos> for thou art nurtured from the treasure veins <eos> of this fair land ; thy golden rootlets sup <eos> her sands of gold — of gold thy petals spun <eos> her golden glory , thou ! of hills and plains <eos> lifting , exultant , every kingly cup <eos> brimmed with the golden vintage of the sun <eos>
i watched them long in my curious dream <eos> till they stood by the borders of the stream <eos> then , just as i thought , the two ways met <eos> but all the brethren were talking yet <eos> and would talk on , till the heaving tide <eos> carried them over , side by side <eos> side by side , for the way was one <eos> the toilsome journey of life was done <eos> and priest and quaker , and all who died <eos> came out alike on the other side <eos> no forms , or crosses , or books had they <eos> no gowns of silk , or suits of gray <eos> no creeds to guide them , or mss <eos> for all had put on christ 's righteousness <eos>
cruel fair love , i justly do complain <eos> of too much rigor and thy heart unkind <eos> that for mine eyes thou hast my body slain <eos> and would not grant that i should favour find <eos> i looked , fair love , and you my love looked fair <eos> i sighed for love and you for sport did smile <eos> your smiles were such as did perfume the air <eos> and this perfum è d did my heart beguile <eos> thus i confess the fault was in mine eyes <eos> begun with sighs and ended with a flame <eos> i for your love did all the world despise <eos> and in these poems honored have your name <eos> then let your love so with my fault dispense <eos> that all my parts feel not mine eyes ’ offense <eos>
love and my love did range the forest wild <eos> mounted alike , upon swift coursers both <eos> love her encountered , though he was a child <eos> “ let 's strive , ” saith he , whereat my love was wroth <eos> and scorned the boy , and checked him with a smile <eos> “ i mounted am , and arm è d with my spear <eos> thou art too weak , thyself do not beguile <eos> i could thee conquer if i naked were <eos> with this love wept , and then my love replied <eos> “ kiss me , sweet boy , so weep my boy no more <eos> thus did my love , and then her force she tried <eos> love was made ice , that fire was before <eos> a kiss of hers , as i , poor soul , do prove <eos> can make the hottest freeze and coldest love <eos>
‘ agreed ! ’ cried north ; thought he , this fall <eos> with wheat and rye i 'll sow it all <eos> in that way i shall get the start <eos> and south may whistle for his part <eos> so thought , so done , the field was sown <eos> and , winter haying come and gone <eos> sly north walked blithely forth to spy <eos> the progress of his wheat and rye <eos> heavens , what a sight ! his brother 's swine <eos> had asked themselves all out to dine <eos> such grunting , munching , rooting , shoving <eos> the soil seemed all alive and moving <eos> as for his grain , such work they 'd made on ‘ t <eos> he could n't spy a single blade on ‘ t <eos>
with nothing to wear , if the climate is suiting <eos> we might get along i am sure pretty well <eos> no washing and starching and crimping and fluting <eos> no muslin and laces and trouble of dressing , they tell <eos> e'er troubles the women , or bothers the men <eos> who soon grow accustomed , as people do here <eos> to fashions prevailing , and things that they ken <eos> to dresses fore shortened where bosoms appear <eos> to bonnets that show but a rose in the wearing <eos> to dresses that sweep like a besom the street <eos> to dresses so gauzy the hoops through are seen <eos> to shoes quite as gauzy to cover the feet <eos> but watch how a man here goes raving and swearing <eos> at wife and all hands , if they 've nothing to eat <eos>
as sheep , that step from forth their fold , by one <eos> or pairs , or three at once ; meanwhile the rest <eos> stand fearfully , bending the eye and nose <eos> to ground , and what the foremost does , that do <eos> the others , gath'ring round her , if she stops <eos> simple and quiet , nor the cause discern <eos> so saw i moving to advance the first <eos> who of that fortunate crew were at the head <eos> of modest mien and graceful in their gait <eos> when they before me had beheld the light <eos> from my right side fall broken on the ground <eos> so that the shadow reach 'd the cave , they stopp 'd <eos> and somewhat back retir 'd : the same did all <eos> who follow 'd , though unweeting of the cause <eos>
in hs ü   chou , in the district of ku f ē ng <eos> there lies a village whose name is chu ch ‘ē n <eos> a hundred miles away from the county town <eos> amid fields of hemp and green of mulberry trees <eos> click , click goes the sound of the spinning wheel <eos> mules and oxen pack the village streets <eos> the girls go drawing the water from the brook <eos> the men go gathering fire wood on the hill <eos> so far from the town government affairs are few <eos> so deep in the hills , man ’ s ways are simple <eos> though they have wealth , they do not traffic with it <eos> though they reach the age , they do not enter the army <eos> each family keeps to its village trade <eos> grey headed , they have never left the gates <eos>
iii . art is the bond of weakness , and we find <eos> therein acknowledgment of failing power <eos> a man would worship , gazing on a flower <eos> onward he passeth , lo his eyes are blind <eos> the unenlivened form he left behind <eos> grew up within him only for an hour <eos> and he will grapple with nature till the dower <eos> of strength shall be retreasured in his mind <eos> and each form record is a high protest <eos> of treason done unto the soul of man <eos> which , striving upwards , ever is oppress 'd <eos> by the old bondage , underneath whose ban <eos> he , failing in his struggle for the best <eos> must live in pain upon what food he can <eos>
there in the forum swarm a numerous train <eos> the subject of debate , a townsman slain <eos> one pleads the fine discharged , which one denied <eos> and bade the public and the laws decide <eos> the witness is produced on either hand <eos> for this , or that , the partial people stand <eos> the appointed heralds still the noisy bands <eos> and form a ring , with sceptres in their hands <eos> on seats of stone , within the sacred place <eos> the reverend elders nodded o ’ er the case <eos> alternate , each the attesting sceptre took <eos> and rising solemn , each his sentence spoke <eos> two golden talents lay amidst , in sight <eos> the prize of him who best adjudged the right <eos>
unrighteous lord of love , what law is this <eos> that me thou makest thus tormented be <eos> the whiles she lordeth in licentious blisse <eos> of her freewill , scorning both thee and me <eos> see ! how the tyrannesse doth ioy to see <eos> the hugh mass á cres which her eyes do make <eos> and humbled harts brings captive unto thee <eos> that thou of them mayst mightie vengeance take <eos> but her proud hart doe thou a little shake <eos> and that high look , with which she doth comptroll <eos> all this worlds pride , bow to a baser make <eos> and al her faults in thy black booke enroll <eos> that i may laugh at her in equall sort <eos> as she doth laugh at me , and makes my pain her sport <eos>
death ! be not proud , though some have called thee <eos> mighty and dreadful , for thou art not so <eos> for those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow <eos> die not , poor death ! nor yet canst thou kill me <eos> from rest and sleep , which but thy picture be <eos> much pleasure , then , from thee much more must flow <eos> and soonest our best men with thee do go <eos> rest of their bones , and soul 's delivery <eos> thou'rt slave to fate , chance , kings , and desperate men <eos> and dost with poison , war , and sickness , dwell <eos> and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well <eos> and better than thy stroke . why swell'st thou , then <eos> one short sleep past we wake eternally <eos> and death shall be no more ; death , thou shalt die <eos>
the social laws from insult to protect <eos> to cherish peace , to cultivate respect <eos> the rich from wanton cruelty restrain <eos> to smooth the bed of penury and pain <eos> the hapless vagrant to his rest restore <eos> the maze of fraud , the haunts of theft explore <eos> the thoughtless maiden , when subdued by art <eos> to aid , and bring her rover to her heart <eos> wild riot 's voice with dignity to quell <eos> forbid unpeaceful passions to rebel <eos> wrest from revenge the meditated harm <eos> for this fair justice raised her sacred arm <eos> for this the rural magistrate , of yore <eos> thy honours , edward , to his mansion bore <eos>
whence should they come , lady ! those happy days <eos> that thy fair hand and gentle heart invoke <eos> upon my head ? alas ! such do not rise <eos> on any , of the many , who with sighs <eos> bear through this journey land of wo , life 's yoke <eos> the light of such lives not in thine own lays <eos> such were not hers , that girl , so fond , so fair <eos> beneath whose image thou hast traced thy pray'r <eos> evil , and few , upon this darksome earth <eos> must be the days of all of mortal birth <eos> then why not mine ? sweet lady ! wish again <eos> not more of joy to me , but less of pain <eos> calm slumber , when life 's troubled hours are past <eos> and with thy friendship cheer them while they last <eos>
pleased with our gay disports , the dame was wont <eos> to set her wheel before the cottage front <eos> and o'er her spectacles would often peer <eos> to view our gambols , and our boyish gear <eos> still as she look 'd , her wheel kept turning round <eos> with its beloved monotony of sound <eos> when tired with play , we 'd set us by her side <eos> ( for out of school she never knew to chide <eos> and wonder at her skill — well known to fame <eos> for who could match in spinning with the dame <eos> her sheets , her linen , which she show 'd with pride <eos> to strangers , still her thriftness testified <eos> though we poor wights did wonder much , in troth <eos> how't was her spinning manufactured cloth <eos>
he spoke ; the goddess with the charming eyes <eos> glows with celestial red , and thus replies <eos> “ is this a scene for love ? on ida ’ s height <eos> exposed to mortal and immortal sight <eos> our joys profaned by each familiar eye <eos> the sport of heaven , and fable of the sky <eos> how shall i e ’ er review the blest abodes <eos> or mix among the senate of the gods <eos> shall i not think , that , with disorder ’ d charms <eos> all heaven beholds me recent from thy arms <eos> with skill divine has vulcan form ’ d thy bower <eos> sacred to love and to the genial hour <eos> if such thy will , to that recess retire <eos> in secret there indulge thy soft desire <eos>
one place there is — beneath the burial sod <eos> where all mankind are equalized by death <eos> another place there is — the fane of god <eos> where all are equal who draw living breath <eos> juggle who will elsewhere with his own soul <eos> playing the judas with a temporal dole <eos> he who can come beneath that awful cope <eos> in the dread presence of a maker just <eos> who metes to every pinch of human dust <eos> one even measure of immortal hope <eos> he who can stand within that holy door <eos> with soul unbowed by that pure spirit level <eos> and frame unequal laws for rich and poor <eos> might sit for hell , and represent the devil <eos>
“ ay ! quail and cringe and crook the supple knee <eos> and beg thy life of me , thine enemy <eos> whom thou , a moment since , didst doom to death <eos> i will not breathe suspicion 's lightest breath <eos> against thy vaunted fame : and even though <eos> before all men thou'st sworn thyself my foe <eos> and pledged thyself wrongly to wreak on me <eos> thy utmost power of mortal injury <eos> in spite of this , should i be first to die <eos> and win the bowers of the blest on high <eos> beside the golden gate of paradise <eos> thee will i wait with ever watchful eyes <eos> ready to plead forgiveness for thy sin <eos> if thou shouldst come , and shouldst not enter in <eos>
the fine delight that fathers thought ; the strong <eos> spur , live and lancing like the blowpipe flame <eos> breathes once and , quench è d faster than it came <eos> leaves yet the mind a mother of immortal song <eos> nine months she then , nay years , nine years she long <eos> within her wears , bears , cares and moulds the same <eos> the widow of an insight lost she lives , with aim <eos> now known and hand at work now never wrong <eos> sweet fire the sire of muse , my soul needs this <eos> i want the one rapture of an inspiration <eos> o then if in my lagging lines you miss <eos> the roll , the rise , the carol , the creation <eos> my winter world , that scarcely breathes that bliss <eos> now , yields you , with some sighs , our explanation <eos>
when autumn suns are soft , and sea winds moan <eos> and golden fruits make sweet the golden air <eos> in gardens where the apple blossoms were <eos> in these old springs before i walked alone <eos> i pass among the pathways overgrown <eos> of all the former flowers that kissed your feet <eos> remains a poppy , pallid from the heat <eos> a wild poppy that the wild winds have sown <eos> alas ! the rose forgets your hands of rose <eos> the lilies slumber in the lily bed <eos> ‘ tis only poppies in the dreamy close <eos> the changeless , windless garden of the dead <eos> you tend , with buds soft as your kiss that lies <eos> in over happy dreams , upon mine eyes <eos>
hard are the rocks , the marble , and the steel <eos> the ancient oak with wind and weather tossed <eos> but you , my love , far harder do i feel <eos> than flint , or these , or is the winter 's frost <eos> my tears too weak , your heart they cannot move <eos> my sighs , that rock , like wind it cannot rent <eos> too tiger like you swear you cannot love <eos> but tears and sighs you fruitless back have sent <eos> the frost too hard , not melted with my flame <eos> i cinders am , and yet you feel no heat <eos> surpass not these , sweet love , for very shame <eos> but let my tears , my vows , my sighs entreat <eos> then shall i say as by trial find <eos> these all are hard , but you , my love , are kind <eos>
the nurse sleeps sweetly , hired to watch the sick <eos> whom snoring she disturbs . as sweetly he <eos> who quits the coach box at the midnight hour <eos> to sleep within the carriage more secure <eos> his legs depending at the open door <eos> sweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk <eos> the tedious rector drawling o'er his head <eos> and sweet the clerk below ; but neither sleep <eos> of lazy nurse , who snores the sick man dead <eos> nor his who quits the box at midnight hour <eos> to slumber in the carriage more secure <eos> nor sleep enjoyed by curate in his desk <eos> nor yet the dozings of the clerk are sweet <eos> compared with the repose the sofa yields <eos>
both'ring the flats assembled round the quod <eos> the queerum queerly smear 'd with dirty black <eos> the dolman sounding , while the sheriff 's nod <eos> prepare the switcher to dead book the whack <eos> while in a rattle sit two blowens flash <eos> salt tears fast streaming from each bungy eye <eos> to nail the ticker , or to mill the cly <eos> through thick and thin their busy muzzlers splash <eos> the mots lament for tyburn 's merry roam <eos> that bubbl 'd prigs must at the new drop fall <eos> and from the start the scamps are cropp 'd at home <eos> all in the sheriff 's picture frame the call <eos> exalted high , dick parted with his flame <eos> and all his comrades swore that he dy 'd game <eos>
the almighty thunderer with a frown replies <eos> that clouds the world , and blackens half the skies <eos> “ strong god of ocean ! thou , whose rage can make <eos> the solid earth ’ s eternal basis shake <eos> what cause of fear from mortal works could move <eos> the meanest subject of our realms above <eos> where ’ er the sun ’ s refulgent rays are cast <eos> thy power is honour ’ d , and thy fame shall last <eos> but yon proud work no future age shall view <eos> no trace remain where once the glory grew <eos> the sapp ’ d foundations by thy force shall fall <eos> and , whelm ’ d beneath the waves , drop the huge wall <eos> vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore <eos> the ruin vanish ’ d , and the name no more <eos>
look you , it is to day as at the first <eos> when adam first was ‘ ware his new made eyes <eos> and opened them , behold the light ! and breath <eos> of god was misting yet about his mouth <eos> whereof they had made his soul . then he looked forth <eos> and was a part of light ; also he saw <eos> beautiful life , and it could move . but eve — eve <eos> was the child of midnight and of sleep <eos> lo , in the dark god led her to his side <eos> it may be in the dark she heard him breathe <eos> before god woke him . and she knew not light <eos> nor life but as a voice that left his lips <eos> a warmth that clasped her ; but the stars were out <eos> and she with wide child eyes gazed up at them <eos>
in thronging crowds they issue to the plains <eos> nor man nor woman in the walls remains <eos> in every face the self same grief is shown <eos> and troy sends forth one universal groan <eos> at scaea ’ s gates they meet the mourning wain <eos> hang on the wheels , and grovel round the slain <eos> the wife and mother , frantic with despair <eos> kiss his pale cheek , and rend their scatter ’ d hair <eos> thus wildly wailing , at the gates they lay <eos> and there had sigh ’ d and sorrow ’ d out the day <eos> but godlike priam from the chariot rose <eos> “ forbear ( he cried ) this violence of woes <eos> first to the palace let the car proceed <eos> then pour your boundless sorrows o ’ er the dead <eos>
woman ! when i behold thee flippant , vain <eos> inconstant , childish , proud , and full of fancies <eos> without that modest softening that enhances <eos> the downcast eye , repentant of the pain <eos> that its mild light creates to heal again <eos> e'en then , elate , my spirit leaps , and prances <eos> e'en then my soul with exultation dances <eos> for that to love , so long , i 've dormant lain <eos> but when i see thee meek , and kind , and tender <eos> heavens ! how desperately do i adore <eos> thy winning graces ;— to be thy defender <eos> i hotly burn — to be a calidore <eos> a very red cross knight — a stout leander <eos> might i be loved by thee like these of yore <eos>
dear chorister , who from those shadows sends <eos> ere that the blushing morn dare show her light <eos> such sad , lamenting strains , that night attends <eos> become all ear ; stars stay to hear thy plight <eos> if one whose grief even reach of thought transcends <eos> who ne'er , not in a dream , did taste delight <eos> may thee importune who like case pretends <eos> and seems to joy in woe , in woe 's despite <eos> tell me ( so may thou fortune milder try <eos> and long , long sing ) for what thou thus complains <eos> since winter 's gone , and sun in dappled sky <eos> enamour 'd , smiles on woods and flowery plains <eos> the bird , as if my questions did her move <eos> with trembling wings sigh 'd forth , ‘ i love , i love <eos>
he knows the sweet vexation in the strife <eos> of love with time , this bard who fain would stray <eos> to fairer place beyond the storms of life <eos> with astral faces near him day by day <eos> in deep mossed dells the mellow waters flow <eos> which best he loves ; for there the echoes , rife <eos> with rich suggestions of his long ago <eos> astarte , pass with thee ! and , far away <eos> dear southern seasons haunt the dreamy eye <eos> spring , flower zoned , and summer , warbling low <eos> in tasselled corn , alternate come and go <eos> while gypsy autumn , splashed from heel to thigh <eos> with vine blood , treads the leaves ; and , halting nigh <eos> wild winter bends across a beard of snow <eos>
love is a breach in the walls , a broken gate <eos> where that comes in that shall not go again <eos> love sells the proud heart 's citadel to fate <eos> they have known shame , who love unloved . even then <eos> when two mouths , thirsty each for each , find slaking <eos> and agony 's forgot , and hushed the crying <eos> of credulous hearts , in heaven — such are but taking <eos> their own poor dreams within their arms , and lying <eos> each in his lonely night , each with a ghost <eos> some share that night . but they know love grows colder <eos> grows false and dull , that was sweet lies at most <eos> astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder <eos> but darkens , and dies out from kiss to kiss <eos> all this is love ; and all love is but this <eos>
i had rather cut man 's purpose deeper than <eos> achieving it be crowned as conqueror <eos> to will divinely is to accomplish more <eos> than a mere deed : it fills anew the wan <eos> aspect of life with blood ; it draws upon <eos> sources beyond the common reach and lore <eos> of mortals , to replenish at its core <eos> the god impassioned energy of man <eos> and herewith all the worlds of deed and thought <eos> quicken again with meaning — pulse and thrill <eos> with deity — that had forgot his touch <eos> there is not any act avails so much <eos> as this invisible wedding of the will <eos> with life — yea , though it seem to accomplish naught <eos>
o happy thames , that didst my stella bear <eos> i saw thee with full many a smiling line <eos> upon thy cheerful face joy 's livery wear <eos> while those fair planets on thy streams did shine <eos> the boat for joy could not to dance forbear <eos> while wanton winds , with beauties so divine <eos> ravish 'd , stay 'd not , till in her golden hair <eos> they did themselves ( o sweetest prison !) twine <eos> and fain those oeol 's youth there would their stay <eos> have made ; but , forced by nature still to fly <eos> first did with puffing kiss those locks display <eos> she , so dishevell 'd , blush 'd . from window i <eos> with sight thereof , cried out , ‘ o fair disgrace <eos> let honour 's self to thee grant highest place <eos>
each day , new proofs of new despair i find <eos> that is , new deaths . no marvel then , though i <eos> make exile my last help ; to th'end mine eye <eos> should not behold the death to me assigned <eos> not that from death absence might save my mind <eos> but that it might take death more patiently <eos> like him , the which by judge condemned to die <eos> to suffer with more ease , his eyes doth blind <eos> your lips in scarlet clad , my judges be <eos> pronouncing sentence of eternal “ no <eos> despair , the hangman that tormenteth me <eos> the death i suffer is the life i have <eos> for only life doth make me die in woe <eos> and only death i for my pardon crave <eos>

when i 've eat my fill and my belt is snug <eos> i begin to think of my baccy plug <eos> i whittle a fill in my horny palm <eos> and the bowl of me old clay pipe i cram <eos> i trim the edges , i tamp it down <eos> i nurse a light with an anxious frown <eos> i begin to draw , and my cheeks tuck in <eos> and all my face is a blissful grin <eos> and up in a cloud the good smoke goes <eos> and the good pipe glimmers and fades and glows <eos> in its throat it chuckles a cheery song <eos> for i likes it hot and i likes it strong <eos> oh , it 's good is grub when you 're feeling hollow <eos> but the best of a meal 's the smoke to follow <eos>
so oft as i her beauty doe behold <eos> and therewith doe her cruelty compare <eos> i marvaile of what substance was the mould <eos> the which her made attonce so cruell faire <eos> not earth ; for her high thoughts more heavenly are <eos> not water ; for her love doth burne like fyre <eos> not ayre ; for she is not so light or rare <eos> not fyre ; for she doth friese with faint desire <eos> then needs another element inquire <eos> whereof she mote be made ; that is , the skye <eos> for to the heaven her haughty looks aspire <eos> and eke her love is pure immortall hye <eos> then sith to heaven ye lykened are the best <eos> be lyke in mercy as in all the rest <eos>
with humble words , the wisest i could frame <eos> and proffer 'd service , i repaid the dame <eos> that , of her grace , she gave her maid to know <eos> the secret meaning of this moral show <eos> and she , to prove what profit i had made <eos> of mystic truth , in fables first convey 'd <eos> demanded , till the next returning may <eos> whether the leaf or flower i would obey <eos> i chose the leaf ; she smiled with sober cheer <eos> and wish 'd me fair adventure for the year <eos> and gave me charms and sigils , for defence <eos> against ill tongues that scandal innocence <eos> but i , said she , my fellows must pursue <eos> already past the plain , and out of view <eos>
we are met , this moonlight , for momentous councils <eos> concerning those two drowsy human lovers <eos> maid marian and her outlawed robin hood <eos> they are in dire peril ; yet we may not break <eos> our vows of silence . many a time <eos> has robin hood by kindly words and deeds <eos> done in his human world , sent a new breath <eos> of life and joy like spring to fairyland <eos> and at the moth hour of this very dew fall <eos> he saved a fairy , whom he thought , poor soul <eos> only a may fly in a spider 's web <eos> he saved her from the clutches of that wizard <eos> that cruel thing , that dark old mystery <eos> whom ye all know and shrink from <eos>
the castle gate stands open now <eos> and the wanderer is welcome to the hall <eos> as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough <eos> no longer scowl the turrets tall <eos> the summer 's long siege at last is o'er <eos> when the first poor outcast went in at the door <eos> she entered with him in disguise <eos> and mastered the fortress by surprise <eos> there is no spot she loves so well on ground <eos> she lingers and smiles there the whole year round <eos> the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land <eos> has hall and bower at his command <eos> and there 's no poor man in the north countree <eos> but is lord of the earldom as much as he <eos>
“ earth has not anything to show more fair <eos> dull would he be of soul who could pass by <eos> a sight so touching in its majesty <eos> this city now doth , like a garment , wear <eos> the beauty of the morning ; silent , bare <eos> ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples lie <eos> open unto the fields , and to the sky <eos> all bright and glittering in the open air <eos> never did sun more beautifully steep <eos> in his first splendour , valley , rock or hill <eos> ne'er saw i , never felt , a calm so deep <eos> the river glideth at his own sweet will <eos> dear god ! the very houses seem asleep <eos> and all that mighty heart is lying still <eos>

a year ago red wrath and keen despair <eos> spake , and the sole word from their darkness sent <eos> laid low the lord not all omnipotent <eos> who stood most like a god of all that were <eos> as gods for pride of power , till fire and air <eos> made earth of all his godhead . lightning rent <eos> the heart of empire 's lurid firmament <eos> and laid the mortal core of manhood bare <eos> but when the calm crowned head that all revere <eos> for valour higher than that which casts out fear <eos> since fear came near it never , comes near death <eos> blind murder cowers before it , knowing that here <eos> no braver soul drew bright and queenly breath <eos> since england wept upon elizabeth <eos>
seeing the gods — why chafe at them <eos> have placed thee here , to share within these walls <eos> our lustral waters , ‘ mid a crowd of thralls <eos> who stand obedient round the altar stone <eos> of our possession . therefore come thou down <eos> and be not over proud . the tale is told <eos> how once alcmena 's son himself , being sold <eos> was patient , though he liked not the slaves ’ mess <eos> and more , if fate must bring thee to this stress <eos> praise god thou art come to a house of high report <eos> and wealth from long ago . the baser sort <eos> who have reaped some sudden harvest unforeseen <eos> are ever cruel to their slaves , and mean <eos> in the measure . we shall give whate'er is due <eos>
when to the garden of untroubled thought <eos> i came of late , and saw the open door <eos> and wished again to enter , and explore <eos> the sweet , wild ways with stainless bloom inwrought <eos> and bowers of innocence with beauty fraught <eos> it seemed some purer voice must speak before <eos> i dared to tread that garden loved of yore <eos> that eden lost unknown and found unsought <eos> then just within the gate i saw a child <eos> a stranger child , yet to my heart most dear <eos> who held his hands to me and softly smiled <eos> with eyes that knew no shade of sin or fear <eos> “ come in , ” he said , “ and play awhile with me <eos> i am the little child you used to be <eos>
one day the doctor found the bottle full <eos> and , being thirsty , took a vigorous pull <eos> put back the “ elixir ” where ‘ t was always found <eos> and had old dobbin saddled and brought round <eos> — you know those old time rhubarb colored nags <eos> that carried doctors and their saddle bags <eos> sagacious beasts ! they stopped at every place <eos> where blinds were shut — knew every patient 's case <eos> looked up and thought — the baby 's in a fit <eos> that wo n't last long — he 'll soon be through with it <eos> but shook their heads before the knockered door <eos> where some old lady told the story o'er <eos> whose endless stream of tribulation flows <eos> for gastric griefs and peristaltic woes <eos>

for three and thirty years , a living seed <eos> a lonely germ , dropt on our waste world 's side <eos> thy death and rising thou didst calmly bide <eos> sore companied by many a clinging weed <eos> sprung from the fallow soil of evil and need <eos> hither and thither tossed , by friends denied <eos> pitied of goodness dull , and scorned of pride <eos> until at length was done the awful deed <eos> and thou didst lie outworn in stony bower <eos> three days asleep — oh , slumber godlike brief <eos> for man of sorrows and acquaint with grief <eos> life seed thou diedst , that death might lose his power <eos> and thou , with rooted stem and shadowy leaf <eos> rise , of humanity the crimson flower <eos>
i raised her tenderly with pitying arms <eos> and in a garden , far from life 's alarms <eos> i buried her , and left her all alone <eos> and wrote this epitaph upon the stone <eos> “ peace to her ashes , but not peace to those <eos> her erewhile friends , the cause of all her woes <eos> who fondled and caressed her for a space <eos> who loved to stroke her soft , confiding face <eos> who gave her food and shelter from her birth <eos> who joined in all her harmless youthful mirth <eos> but , when they went for holidays to roam <eos> shut to the door of what had been her home <eos> and thoughtless left to die upon the mat <eos> their faithful but forgotten tabby cat <eos>

feronde , a rich , but awkward , vulgar clown <eos> a ninny was believed throughout the town <eos> he had the charge of revenues not slight <eos> which he collected for a friar white <eos> of these i 've known as good as any black <eos> when husbands some assistance seemed to lack <eos> and had so much to do , they monks might need <eos> or other friends , their work at home to speed <eos> this friar for to morrow never thought <eos> but squandered ev'ry thing as soon as brought <eos> no saint apostle less of wealth retained <eos> good cheer o'er ev'ry wish triumphant reigned <eos> save now and then to have a little fun <eos> ( unknown to others ) with a pretty nun <eos>
old friend , farewell ! your kindly door again <eos> i enter , but the master 's hand in mine <eos> no more clasps welcome , and the temperate wine <eos> that cheered our long nights , other lips must stain <eos> all is unchanged , but i expect in vain <eos> the face alert , the manners free and fine <eos> the seventy years borne lightly as the pine <eos> wears its first down of snow in green disdain <eos> much did he , and much well ; yet most of all <eos> i prized his skill in leisure and the ease <eos> of a life flowing full without a plan <eos> for most are idly busy ; him i call <eos> thrice fortunate who knew himself to please <eos> learned in those arts that make a gentleman <eos>
in quest of peace great montezuma stands <eos> a sovereign supplicant with lifted hands <eos> brings all his treasure , yields the regal sway <eos> bids vassal millions their new lord obey <eos> and plies the victor with incessant prayer <eos> thro ravaged realms the harmless race to spare <eos> but treasures , tears and sceptres plead in vain <eos> nor threats can move him , nor a world restrain <eos> while blind religion 's prostituted name <eos> and monkish fury guide the sacred flame <eos> o'er crowded fanes their fires unhallow 'd bend <eos> climb the wide roofs , the lofty towers ascend <eos> pour thro the lowering skies the smoky flood <eos> and stain the fields , and quench the blaze in blood <eos>
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought <eos> i summon up remembrance of things past <eos> i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought <eos> and with old woes new wail my dear time 's waste <eos> then can i drown an eye ( unused to flow <eos> for precious friends hid in death 's dateless night <eos> and weep afresh love 's long since cancelled woe <eos> and moan th ’ expense of many a vanished sight <eos> then can i grieve at grievances foregone <eos> and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er <eos> the sad account of fore bemoaned moan <eos> which i new pay as if not paid before <eos> but if the while i think on thee ( dear friend <eos> all losses are restored , and sorrows end <eos>
behind the palace lay a maidan wide <eos> for exercise in arms and manly sports <eos> its sides bordered by gently rising hills <eos> where at their ease the city 's myriads sat <eos> under the shade of high pruned spreading trees <eos> fanned by cool breezes from the snow capped peaks <eos> while north , and next the lake , a stately dome <eos> stood out , on slender , graceful columns raised <eos> with seats , rank above rank , in order placed <eos> the throne above , and near the throne were bowers <eos> of slender lattice work , with trailing vines <eos> thick set with flowers of every varied tint <eos> breathing perfumes , where beauty 's champions <eos> might sit , unseen of all yet seeing all <eos>
there shall he lie dispersed amid great riches <eos> such gold , such arrogance , so many bold hearts <eos> all the sunken armadas pressed to powder <eos> by weight of incredible seas ! that mingled wrack <eos> no livening sun shall visit till the crust <eos> of earth be riven , or this rolling planet <eos> reel on its axis ; till the moon chained tides <eos> unloosed , deliver up that white atlantis <eos> whose naked peaks shall bleach above the slaked <eos> thirst of sahara , fringed by weedy tangles <eos> of atlas 's drown 'd cedars , frowning eastward <eos> to where the sands of india lie cold <eos> and heap 'd himalaya 's a rib of coral <eos> slowly uplifted , grain on grain <eos>
v. vice is a monster of so frightful mien <eos> as , to be hated , needs but to be seen <eos> yet seen too oft , familiar with her face <eos> we first endure , then pity , then embrace <eos> but where th ’ extreme of vice , was ne'er agreed <eos> ask where 's the north ? at york , ‘ tis on the tweed <eos> in scotland , at the orcades ; and there <eos> at greenland , zembla , or the lord knows where <eos> no creature owns it in the first degree <eos> but thinks his neighbour further gone than he <eos> even those who dwell beneath its very zone <eos> or never feel the rage , or never own <eos> what happier natures shrink at with affright <eos> the hard inhabitant contends is right <eos>
i think if you had loved me when i wanted <eos> if i 'd looked up one day , and seen your eyes <eos> and found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted <eos> and your brown face , that 's full of pity and wise <eos> flushed suddenly ; the white godhead in new fear <eos> intolerably so struggling , and so shamed <eos> most holy and far , if you 'd come all too near <eos> if earth had seen earth 's lordliest wild limbs tamed <eos> shaken , and trapped , and shivering , for my touch <eos> myself should i have slain ? or that foul you <eos> but this the strange gods , who had given so much <eos> to have seen and known you , this they might not do <eos> one last shame 's spared me , one black word 's unspoken <eos> and i 'm alone ; and you have not awoken <eos>
thou man of science , who , with practised eye <eos> and glance untiring sweep'st the starry sky <eos> speeding in thought along those trackless ways <eos> where planets burn and constellations blaze <eos> leaving uncounted worlds behind thee far <eos> listen — “ i am the bright and morning star <eos> he says — and does not thought more gladly stray <eos> where the meek herald of the rising day <eos> sits like a peaceful vestal bearing high <eos> her radiant urn on the soft eastern sky <eos> thence , rising , seek the morning star of heaven <eos> who to night 's myriad suns their light has given <eos> and , bowing low light 's sacred fount before <eos> in wondering , reverential awe adore <eos>
“ o jove ( he cried ) o all ye powers above <eos> see the lewd dalliance of the queen of love <eos> me , awkward me , she scorns ; and yields her charms <eos> to that fair lecher , the strong god of arms <eos> if i am lame , that stain my natal hour <eos> by fate imposed ; such me my parent bore <eos> why was i born ? see how the wanton lies <eos> oh sight tormenting to a husband 's eyes <eos> but yet , i trust , this once e'en mars would fly <eos> his fair one 's arms — he thinks her , once , too nigh <eos> but there remain , ye guilty , in my power <eos> till jove refunds his shameless daughter 's dower <eos> too dear i prized a fair enchanting face <eos> beauty unchaste is beauty in disgrace <eos>
as to a child , i talked my heart asleep <eos> with empty promise of the coming day <eos> and it slept rather for my words made sleep <eos> than from a thought of what their sense did say <eos> for did it care for sense , would it not wake <eos> and question closer to the morrow ’ s pleasure <eos> would it not edge nearer my words , to take <eos> the promise in the meting of its measure <eos> so , if it slept , ’ twas that it cared but for <eos> the present sleepy use of promised joy <eos> thanking the fruit but for the forecome flower <eos> which the less active senses best enjoy <eos> thus with deceit do i detain the heart <eos> of which deceit ’ s self knows itself a part <eos>
whither fled lamia , now a lady bright <eos> a full born beauty new and exquisite <eos> she fled into that valley they pass o'er <eos> who go to corinth from cenchreas ’ shore <eos> and rested at the foot of those wild hills <eos> the rugged founts of the per æ an rills <eos> and of that other ridge whose barren back <eos> stretches , with all its mist and cloudy rack <eos> south westward to cleone . there she stood <eos> about a young bird 's flutter from a wood <eos> fair , on a sloping green of mossy tread <eos> by a clear pool , wherein she passioned <eos> to see herself escap 'd from so sore ills <eos> while her robes flaunted with the daffodils <eos>
ever athwart life 's sunlit , upland ways <eos> falleth the shadow of impending death <eos> and still life 's flowers beneath his blighting breath <eos> to ashes wither , and to dust , her bays <eos> what were the worth of hard won power or praise <eos> awaits us all the grave cell dark and deep <eos> the greedy grave worm 's maw , the awful sleep <eos> when death his cold hand on our pulses lays <eos> what then the end of action or of strife <eos> the sphinx è d riddle of the universe <eos> nature 's unsolved enigma , who may prove <eos> life 's passion play all blindly men rehearse <eos> but yet our recompense for birth , for life <eos> for death itself , meseems , is deathless love <eos>
i saw a silver swan swim down the lea <eos> singing a sad farewell unto the vale <eos> while fishes leapt to hear her melody <eos> and on each thorn a gentle nightingale <eos> and many other birds forbore their notes <eos> leaping from tree to tree , as she along <eos> the panting bosom of the current floats <eos> rapt with the music of her dying song <eos> when from a thick and all entangled spring <eos> a neatherd rude came with no small ado <eos> dreading an ill presage to hear her sing <eos> and quickly struck her tender neck in two <eos> whereat the birds , methought , flew thence with speed <eos> and inly griev 'd for such a cruel deed <eos>
another battle ! and the sounds have rolled <eos> by many a gloomy gorge and wasted plain <eos> o'er huddled hills and mountains manifold <eos> like winds that run before a heavy rain <eos> when autumn lops the leaves and drooping grain <eos> and earth lies deep in brown and cloudy gold <eos> my brothers , lo ! our grand old england stands <eos> with weapons gleaming in her ready hands <eos> outside the tumult ! let us watch and trust <eos> that she will never darken in the dust <eos> and drift of wild contention , but remain <eos> the hope and stay of many troubled lands <eos> where so she waits the issue of the fight <eos> aloof ; but praying “ god defend the right <eos>
like as the dove , which seeled up doth fly <eos> is neither freed , nor yet to service bound <eos> but hopes to gain some help by mounting high <eos> till want of force do force her fall to ground <eos> right so my mind , caught by his guiding eye <eos> and thence cast off where his sweet hurt he found <eos> hath neither leave to live , nor doom to die <eos> nor held in evil , nor suffered to be sound <eos> but with his wings of fancies up he goes <eos> to high conceits , whose fruits are oft but small <eos> till wounded , blind , and wearied spirit , lose <eos> both force to fly , and knowledge where to fall <eos> o happy dove , if she no bondage tried <eos> more happy i , might i in bondage bide <eos>

as to some lovely temple , tenantless <eos> long since , that once was sweet with shivering brass <eos> knowing well its altars ruined and the grass <eos> grown up between the stones , yet from excess <eos> of grief hard driven , or great loneliness <eos> the worshiper returns , and those who pass <eos> marvel him crying on a name that was <eos> so is it now with me in my distress <eos> your body was a temple to delight <eos> cold are its ashes whence the breath is fled <eos> yet here one time your spirit was wont to move <eos> here might i hope to find you day or night <eos> and here i come to look for you , my love <eos> even now , foolishly , knowing you are dead <eos>
o son of man , by lying tongues adored <eos> by slaughterous hands of slaves with feet red shod <eos> in carnage deep as ever christian trod <eos> profaned with prayer and sacrifice abhorred <eos> and incense from the trembling tyrant 's horde <eos> brute worshippers or wielders of the rod <eos> most murderous even of all that call thee god <eos> most treacherous even that ever called thee lord <eos> face loved of little children long ago <eos> head hated of the priests and rulers then <eos> if thou see this , or hear these hounds of thine <eos> run ravening as the gadarean swine <eos> say , was not this thy passion , to foreknow <eos> in death 's worst hour the works of christian men <eos>

“ st. george for merrie england ! ” let us cry <eos> and each a red rose pin upon his breast <eos> then face the foe with fearless front and eye <eos> through all our frowning leaguer in the west <eos> for not alone his patron day it is <eos> wherefrom our noble george hath drawn his name <eos> three centuries and a half gone by ere this <eos> by shakespeare 's birth it won a second fame <eos> a greater glory is its crown to day <eos> since at its first and faintest uttered breath <eos> a mighty angel rolled the stone away <eos> that sealed his tomb who captive now leads death <eos> and thereby did the great example give <eos> that they who die for others most shall live <eos>
and beatrice : “ the first diving soul <eos> that ever the first virtue fram 'd , admires <eos> within these rays his maker . ” like the leaf <eos> that bows its lithe top till the blast is blown <eos> by its own virtue rear 'd then stands aloof <eos> so i , the whilst she said , awe stricken bow 'd <eos> then eagerness to speak embolden 'd me <eos> and i began : “ o fruit ! that wast alone <eos> mature , when first engender 'd ! ancient father <eos> that doubly seest in every wedded bride <eos> thy daughter by affinity and blood <eos> devoutly as i may , i pray thee hold <eos> converse with me : my will thou seest ; and i <eos> more speedily to hear thee , tell it not <eos>
“ once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee <eos> and was the safeguard of the west : the worth <eos> of venice did not fall below her birth <eos> venice , the eldest child of liberty <eos> she was a maiden city , bright and free <eos> no guile seduced , no force could violate <eos> and , when she took unto herself a mate <eos> she must espouse the everlasting sea <eos> and what if she had seen those glories fade <eos> those titles vanish , and that strength decay <eos> yet shall some tribute of regret be paid <eos> when her long life hath reached its final day <eos> men are we , and must grieve when even the shade <eos> of that which once was great , is passed away <eos>

at length a wedding much attention caught <eos> the lads and lasses of the hamlet sought <eos> to see the couple pass : the belle perceived <eos> the very man for whom her bosom heaved <eos> and loudly cried , behold scamander 's flood <eos> which raised surprise ; soon numbers round her stood <eos> astonishment expressed , but still the fair <eos> whate'er was asked , would nothing more declare <eos> than , in the spacious , blue , ethereal sky <eos> her marriage would be soon , they might rely <eos> a laugh prevailed ; for what was to be done <eos> the god with hasty steps away had run <eos> and none with stones pursued his rapid flight <eos> the deity was quickly ought of sight <eos>
father , part of his double interest <eos> unto thy kingdom thy son gives to me <eos> his jointure in the knotty trinity <eos> he keeps , and gives to me his death 's conquest <eos> this lamb , whose death with life the world hath blest <eos> was from the world 's beginning slain , and he <eos> hath made two wills , which , with the legacy <eos> of his and thy kingdom , thy sons invest <eos> yet such are these laws , that men argue yet <eos> whether a man those statutes can fulfil <eos> none doth ; but thy all healing grace and spirit <eos> revive again what law and letter kill <eos> thy law 's abridgment and thy last command <eos> is all but love ; oh , let this last will stand <eos>
if i should learn , in some quite casual way <eos> that you were gone , not to return again <eos> read from the back page of a paper , say <eos> held by a neighbor in a subway train <eos> how at the corner of this avenue <eos> and such a street ( so are the papers filled <eos> a hurrying man — who happened to be you <eos> at noon to day had happened to be killed <eos> i should not cry aloud — i could not cry <eos> aloud , or wring my hands in such a place <eos> i should but watch the station lights rush by <eos> with a more careful interest on my face <eos> or raise my eyes and read with greater care <eos> where to store furs and how to treat the hair <eos>
the curtains were half drawn , the floor was swept <eos> and strewn with rushes , rosemary and may <eos> lay thick upon the bed on which i lay <eos> where through the lattice ivy shadows crept <eos> he leaned above me , thinking that i slept <eos> and could not hear him ; but i heard him say <eos> ‘ poor child , poor child : ’ and as he turned away <eos> came a deep silence , and i knew he wept <eos> he did not touch the shroud , or raise the fold <eos> that hid my face , or take my hand in his <eos> or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head <eos> he did not love me living ; but once dead <eos> he pitied me ; and very sweet it is <eos> to know he still is warm though i am cold <eos>
so mid the danaans cried a voice : nor yet <eos> within the mighty soul of peleus ’ son <eos> lulled was the storm of wrath , but fiercely he spake <eos> “ lie there in dust , thy follies all forgot <eos> ‘ tis not for knaves to beard their betters : once <eos> thou didst provoke odysseus ’ steadfast soul <eos> babbling with venomous tongue a thousand gibes <eos> and didst escape with life ; but thou hast found <eos> the son of peleus not so patient souled <eos> who with one only buffet from his hand <eos> unkennels thy dog 's soul ! a bitter doom <eos> hath swallowed thee : by thine own rascalry <eos> thy life is sped . hence from achaean men <eos> and mouth out thy revilings midst the dead <eos>
stranger than any book i 've ever read <eos> here on the reeking battlefield i lie <eos> under the stars , propped up with smeary dead <eos> like too , if no one takes me in , to die <eos> hit on the arms , legs , liver , lungs and gall <eos> damn glad there 's nothing more of me to hit <eos> but calm , and feeling never pain at all <eos> and full of wonder at the turn of it <eos> for of the dead around me three are mine <eos> three foemen vanquished in the whirl of fight <eos> so if i die i have no right to whine <eos> i feel i 've done my little bit all right <eos> i do n't know how — but there the beggars are <eos> as dead as herrings pickled in a jar <eos>
the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts <eos> and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts <eos> at this , the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook <eos> a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look <eos> she sees , and trembles at the approaching ill <eos> just in the jaws of ruin , and codille <eos> and now , ( as oft in some distemper 'd state <eos> on one nice trick depends the general fate <eos> an ace of hearts steps forth : the king unseen <eos> lurk 'd in her hand , and mourn 'd his captive queen <eos> he springs to vengeance with an eager pace <eos> and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace <eos> the nymph , exulting , fills with shouts the sky <eos> the walls , the woods , and long canals reply <eos>

we cannot choose our sorrows . one there was <eos> who , reverent of soul , and strong with trust <eos> cried , ‘ god , though thou shouldst bow me to the dust <eos> yet will i praise thy everlasting laws <eos> beggared , my faith would never halt or pause <eos> but sing thy glory , feasting on a crust <eos> only one boon , one precious boon i must <eos> demand of thee , o opulent great cause <eos> let love stay with me , constant to the end <eos> though fame pass by and poverty pursue <eos> with freighted hold her life ship onward sailed <eos> the world gave wealth , and pleasure , and a friend <eos> unmarred by envy , and whose heart was true <eos> but ere the sun reached midday , love had failed <eos>

sometimes an action on the stage is shown <eos> sometimes ‘ tis done elsewhere , and there made known <eos> a thing when heard , remember , strikes less keen <eos> on the spectator 's mind than when ‘ tis seen <eos> yet ‘ twere not well in public to display <eos> a business best transacted far away <eos> and much may be secluded from the eye <eos> for well graced tongues to tell of by and by <eos> medea must not shed her children 's blood <eos> nor savage atreus cook man 's flesh for food <eos> nor philomel turn bird or cadmus snake <eos> with people looking on and wide awake <eos> if scenes like these before my eyes be thrust <eos> they shock belief and generate disgust <eos>
the silvery dimness of a happy dream <eos> i 've known of late . methought where byron moans <eos> like some wild gulf in melancholy zones <eos> i passed tear blinded . once a lurid gleam <eos> of stormy sunset loitered on the sea <eos> while , travelling troubled like a straitened stream <eos> the voice of shelley died away from me <eos> still sore at heart , i reached a lake lit lea <eos> and then the green mossed glades with many a grove <eos> where lies the calm which wordsworth used to love <eos> and , lastly , locksley hall , from whence did rise <eos> a haunting song that blew and breathed and blew <eos> with rare delights . ‘ twas there i woke and knew <eos> the sumptuous comfort left in drowsy eyes <eos>
the peopled fold thy kindly care have found <eos> the horned bull , tremendous , spurns the ground <eos> the lordly lion has enough and more <eos> the forest trembles at his very roar <eos> thou giv'st the ass his hide , the snail his shell <eos> the puny wasp , victorious , guards his cell <eos> thy minions , kings defend , controul devour <eos> in all th ’ omnipotence of rule and power <eos> foxes and statesmen subtle wiles ensure <eos> the cit and polecat stink , and are secure <eos> toads with their poison , doctors with their drug <eos> the priest and hedgehog , in their robes , are snug <eos> e'en silly women have defensive arts <eos> their eyes , their tongues — and nameless other parts <eos>
keep love for youth , and violets for the spring <eos> or if these bloom when worn out autumn grieves <eos> let them lie hid in double shade of leaves <eos> their own , and others dropped down withering <eos> for violets suit when home birds build and sing <eos> not when the outbound bird a passage cleaves <eos> not with dry stubble of mown harvest sheaves <eos> but when the green world buds to blossoming <eos> keep violets for the spring , and love for youth <eos> love that should dwell with beauty , mirth , and hope <eos> or if a later sadder love be born <eos> let this not look for grace beyond its scope <eos> but give itself , nor plead for answering truth <eos> a grateful ruth tho ’ gleaning scanty corn <eos>
as the chill 'd robin , bound to florida <eos> upon a morn of autumn , crosses flying <eos> the air track of a snipe most passing fair <eos> yet colder in her blood than she is fair <eos> and as that robin lingers on the wing <eos> and feels the snipe 's flight in the eddying air <eos> and loves her for her coldness not the less <eos> but fain would win her to that warmer sky <eos> where love lies waking with the fragrant stars <eos> lo i — a languisher for sunnier climes <eos> where fruit , leaf , blossom , on the trees forever <eos> image the tropic deathlessness of love <eos> have met , and long 'd to win thee , fairest lady <eos> to a more genial clime than cold broadway <eos>
so late in autumn half the world 's asleep <eos> and half the wakeful world looks pinched and pale <eos> for dampness now , not freshness , rides the gale <eos> and cold and colorless comes ashore the deep <eos> with tides that bluster or with tides that creep <eos> now veiled uncouthness wears an uncouth veil <eos> of fog , not sultry haze ; and blight and bale <eos> have done their worst , and leaves rot on the heap <eos> so late in autumn one forgets the spring <eos> forgets the summer with its opulence <eos> the callow birds that long have found a wing <eos> the swallows that more lately gat them hence <eos> will anything like spring , will anything <eos> like summer , rouse one day the slumbering sense <eos>
“ there tantalus along the stygian bounds <eos> pours out deep groans ( with groans all hell resounds <eos> e'en in the circling floods refreshment craves <eos> and pines with thirst amidst a sea of waves <eos> when to the water he his lip applies <eos> back from his lip the treacherous water flies <eos> above , beneath , around his hapless head <eos> trees of all kinds delicious fruitage spread <eos> there figs , sky dyed , a purple hue disclose <eos> green looks the olive , the pomegranate glows <eos> there dangling pears exalting scents unfold <eos> and yellow apples ripen into gold <eos> the fruit he strives to seize ; but blasts arise <eos> toss it on high , and whirl it to the skies <eos>

dares he behold the thing he is , what thing <eos> he would become is in his mind its child <eos> astir , demanding birth to light and wing <eos> for battle prompt , by pleasure unbeguiled <eos> so moves he forth in faith , if he has made <eos> his mind god 's temple , dedicate to truth <eos> earth 's nourishing delights , no more gainsaid <eos> he tastes , as doth the bridegroom rich in youth <eos> then knows he love , that beckons and controls <eos> the star of sky upon his footway cast <eos> then match in him who holds his tempters fast <eos> the body 's love and mind 's , whereof the soul 's <eos> then earth her man for woman finds at last <eos> to speed the pair unto her goal of goals <eos>
thy bosom is endeared with all hearts <eos> which i by lacking have supposed dead <eos> and there reigns love and all love 's loving parts <eos> and all those friends which i thought buried <eos> how many a holy and obsequious tear <eos> hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye <eos> as interest of the dead , which now appear <eos> but things removed that hidden in thee lie <eos> thou art the grave where buried love doth live <eos> hung with the trophies of my lovers gone <eos> who all their parts of me to thee did give <eos> that due of many , now is thine alone <eos> their images i loved , i view in thee <eos> and thou ( all they ) hast all the all of me <eos>
inglorious friend ! most confident i am <eos> thy life is one of very little ease <eos> albeit men mock thee with their similes <eos> and prate of being “ happy as a clam <eos> what though thy shell protects thy fragile head <eos> from the sharp bailiffs of the briny sea <eos> thy valves are , sure , no safety valves to thee <eos> while rakes are free to desecrate thy bed <eos> and bear thee off — as foemen take their spoil <eos> far from thy friends and family to roam <eos> forced , like a hessian , from thy native home <eos> to meet destruction in a foreign broil <eos> though thou art tender yet thy humble bard <eos> declares , o clam ! thy case is shocking hard <eos>
look how the pale queen of the silent night <eos> doth cause the ocean to attend upon her <eos> and he , as long as she is in his sight <eos> with his full tide is ready her to honor <eos> but when the silver wagon of the moon <eos> is mounted up so high he cannot follow <eos> the sea calls home his crystal waves to moan <eos> and with low ebb doth manifest his sorrow <eos> so you that are the sovereign of my heart <eos> have all my joys attending on your will <eos> my joys low ebbing when you do depart <eos> when you return , their tide my heart doth fill <eos> so as you come , and as you do depart <eos> joys ebb and flow within my tender heart <eos>
all night i wrestled with a memory <eos> which knocked insurgent at the gates of thought <eos> the crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought <eos> its disillusion ; now i only cry <eos> for peace , for power to forget the lie <eos> which hope too long has whispered . so i sought <eos> the sleep which would not come , and night was fraught <eos> with old emotions weeping silently <eos> i heard your voice again , and knew the things <eos> which you had promised proved an empty vaunt <eos> i felt your clinging hands while night 's broad wings <eos> cherished our love in darkness . from the lawn <eos> a sudden , quivering birdnote , like a taunt <eos> my arms held nothing but the empty dawn <eos>
“ as ever on this side the boiling wave <eos> thou seest diminishing , ” the centaur said <eos> “ so on the other , be thou well assur 'd <eos> it lower still and lower sinks its bed <eos> till in that part it reuniting join <eos> where ‘ t is the lot of tyranny to mourn <eos> there heav'n ' s stern justice lays chastising hand <eos> on attila , who was the scourge of earth <eos> on sextus , and on pyrrhus , and extracts <eos> tears ever by the seething flood unlock 'd <eos> from the rinieri , of corneto this <eos> pazzo the other nam 'd , who fill 'd the ways <eos> with violence and war . ” this said , he turn 'd <eos> and quitting us , alone repass 'd the ford <eos>
the wise do send their hearts before them to <eos> dear bless é d heaven , despite the veil between <eos> the foolish nurse their hearts within the screen <eos> of this familiar world , where all we do <eos> or have is old , for there is nothing new <eos> yet elder far that world we have not seen <eos> god 's presence antedates what else hath been <eos> many the foolish seem , the wise seem few <eos> oh foolishest fond folly of a heart <eos> divided , neither here nor there at rest <eos> that hankers after heaven , but clings to earth <eos> that neither here nor there knows thorough mirth <eos> half choosing , wholly missing , the good part <eos> oh fool among the foolish , in thy quest <eos>
“ the lion king forgets his savage pride <eos> and courts with playful paws his tawny bride <eos> the listening tiger hears with kindling flame <eos> the love lorn night call of his brinded dame <eos> despotic love dissolves the bestial war <eos> bends their proud necks , and joins them to his car <eos> shakes o'er the obedient pairs his silken thong <eos> and goads the humble , or restrains the strong <eos> slow roll the silver wheels ,— in beauty 's pride <eos> celestial psyche blushing by his side <eos> the lordly bull behind and warrior horse <eos> with voice of thunder shake the echoing course <eos> chain 'd to the car with herds domestic move <eos> and swell the triumph of despotic love <eos>
how can i woo you in this ancient suit <eos> you do not notice it , of course ; i know it <eos> my soul is burdened with a shapeless boot <eos> your heart is singing welcome to your poet <eos> here in the shadowy settle i can sit <eos> and sparkle with you , brightly confidential <eos> but when into the lamp bright zone you flit <eos> i shrink into some corner penitential <eos> a well dressed crowd , their tailors all unpaid <eos> throng round you there , and cuffs and collars glisten <eos> of pity 's blindness , as of scorn , afraid <eos> i shun the merry fray , and darkling listen <eos> for who could urge the timidest of suits <eos> conscious of such indifferent clothes and boots <eos>

his fancy paints their distant paths so gay <eos> that childish fortitude awhile gives way <eos> he feels his dreadful loss — yet short the pain <eos> soon he resumes his cheerfulness again <eos> pond'ring how best his moments to employ <eos> he sings his little songs of nameless joy <eos> creeps on the warm green turf for many an hour <eos> and plucks by chance the white and yellow flow'r <eos> smoothing their stems , while resting on his knees <eos> he binds a nosegay which he never sees <eos> along the homeward path then feels his way <eos> lifting his brow against the shining day <eos> and , with a playful rapture round his eyes <eos> presents a sighing parent with the prize <eos>
o spring , that flutter'st the slow winter by <eos> to drop thy buds before his frosty feet <eos> dost thou not grieve to see thy darlings lie <eos> in trodden death , and weep their beauty sweet <eos> yet must thou cast thy tender offering <eos> and make thy way above thy mourn è d dead <eos> or frowning winter would be always king <eos> and thou wouldst never walk with crown è d head <eos> so gentle love must make his venturous way <eos> among the shaken buds of his own pain <eos> and many a hope blown garland meekly lay <eos> before the chilly season of disdain <eos> but as no beauty may the spring outglow <eos> so he , when throned , no greater lord doth know <eos>
that time of life thou mayst in me behold <eos> when yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang <eos> upon those boughs which shake against the cold <eos> bare ruin 'd choirs , where late the sweet birds sang <eos> in me thou see'st the twilight of such day <eos> as after sunset fadeth in the west <eos> which by and by black night doth take away <eos> death 's second self , that seals up all in rest <eos> in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire <eos> that on the ashes of his youth doth lie <eos> as the death bed whereon it must expire <eos> consumed with that which it was nourished by <eos> this thou perceivest , which makes thy love more strong <eos> to love that well which thou must leave ere long <eos>

it is not to be thought of that the flood <eos> of british freedom , which to the open sea <eos> of the world 's praise from dark antiquity <eos> hath flowed , ‘ with pomp of waters , unwithstood <eos> roused though it be full often to a mood <eos> which spurns the check of salutary bands <eos> that this most famous stream in bogs and sands <eos> should perish , and to evil and to good <eos> be lost forever . in our halls is hung <eos> armoury of the invincible knights of old <eos> we must be free or die , who speak the tongue <eos> that shakespeare spake ; the faith and morals hold <eos> which milton held .— in everything we are sprung <eos> of earth 's first blood , have titles manifold <eos>
milton ! i think thy spirit hath passed away <eos> from these white cliffs and high embattled towers <eos> this gorgeous fiery coloured world of ours <eos> seems fallen into ashes dull and grey <eos> and the age changed unto a mimic play <eos> wherein we waste our else too crowded hours <eos> for all our pomp and pageantry and powers <eos> we are but fit to delve the common clay <eos> seeing this little isle on which we stand <eos> this england , this sea lion of the sea <eos> by ignorant demagogues is held in fee <eos> who love her not : dear god ! is this the land <eos> which bare a triple empire in her hand <eos> when cromwell spake the word democracy <eos>
ser federigo thought not of the chase <eos> the tender vision of her lovely face <eos> i will not say he seems to see , he sees <eos> in the leaf shadows of the trellises <eos> herself , yet not herself ; a lovely child <eos> with flowing tresses , and eyes wide and wild <eos> coming undaunted up the garden walk <eos> and looking not at him , but at the hawk <eos> “ beautiful falcon ! ” said he , “ would that i <eos> might hold thee on my wrist , or see thee fly <eos> the voice was hers , and made strange echoes start <eos> through all the haunted chambers of his heart <eos> as an aeolian harp through gusty doors <eos> of some old ruin its wild music pours <eos>

“ the barley harvest was nodding white <eos> when my children died on the rocky height <eos> and the reapers were singing on hill and plain <eos> when i came to my task of sorrow and pain <eos> but now the season of rain is nigh <eos> the sun is dim in the thickening sky <eos> and the clouds in sullen darkness rest <eos> where he hides his light at the doors of the west <eos> i hear the howl of the wind that brings <eos> the long drear storm on its heavy wings <eos> but the howling wind and the driving rain <eos> will beat on my houseless head in vain <eos> i shall stay , from my murdered sons to scare <eos> the beasts of the desert , and fowls of air <eos>
if his stately mother knew what i know <eos> as she weeping stood by his side this morning <eos> would she clasp me in motherly love and woe <eos> or drive me out in the cold with scorning <eos> if she knew that i loved him better than life <eos> better than death ; since for him i gave <eos> my hopes of rest , that i faced life 's strife <eos> and renounced the quiet and restful grave <eos> when his strong , true hand drew me back that day <eos> when woe , and want , and the want of pity <eos> drove me down where the cold waves lay <eos> like wolves round the walls of this cruel city <eos> “ not much ? ” would she say with her proud lip 's curl <eos> “ only the life of a sewing girl <eos>
men may pursue the beautiful , while they <eos> love not the good , the life of all the fair <eos> keen eyed for beauty , they will find it where <eos> the darkness of their eyes hath power to slay <eos> the vision of the good in beauty 's ray <eos> though fruits the same life giving branches bear <eos> so in a statue they will see the rare <eos> beauty of thought moulded of dull crude clay <eos> while loving joys nor prayer their souls expand <eos> so thou didst mould thy thoughts in life not art <eos> teaching with human voice , and eye , and hand <eos> that none the beauty from the truth might part <eos> their oneness in thy flesh we joyous hail <eos> the holy of holies ’ cloud illumined veil <eos>
he said , and agamemnon went his way <eos> rejoicing ; through the crowd he pass 'd , and came <eos> where stood th ’ ajaces ; them , in act to arm <eos> amid a cloud of infantry he found <eos> and as a goat herd from his watch tow'r crag <eos> beholds a cloud advancing o'er the sea <eos> by zephyr 's breath impell 'd ; as from afar <eos> he gazes , black as pitch , it sweeps along <eos> o'er the dark ocean 's face , and with it brings <eos> a hurricane of rain ; he , shudd'ring , sees <eos> and drives his flock beneath the shelt'ring cave <eos> so thick and dark , about th ’ ajaces stirr 'd <eos> impatient for the war , the stalwart youths <eos> black masses , bristling close with spear and shield <eos>
come back to me , who wait and watch for you <eos> or come not yet , for it is over then <eos> and long it is before you come again <eos> so far between my pleasures are and few <eos> while , when you come not , what i do i do <eos> thinking “ now when he comes , ” my sweetest “ when <eos> for one man is my world of all the men <eos> this wide world holds ; o love , my world is you <eos> howbeit , to meet you grows almost a pang <eos> because the pang of parting comes so soon <eos> my hope hangs waning , waxing , like a moon <eos> between the heavenly days on which we meet <eos> ah me , but where are now the songs i sang <eos> when life was sweet because you called them sweet <eos>
“ e'en on the day when youth with beauty wed <eos> the flames surprized them in their nuptial bed <eos> 435 seen at the opening sash with bosom bare <eos> with wringing hands , and dark dishevel 'd hair <eos> the blushing beauty with disorder 'd charms <eos> round her fond lover winds her ivory arms <eos> beat , as they clasp , their throbbing hearts with fear <eos> 440 and many a kiss is mix 'd with many a tear <eos> ah me ! in vain the labouring engines pour <eos> round their pale limbs the ineffectual shower <eos> — then crash 'd the floor , while shrinking crouds retire <eos> and love and virtue sunk amid the fire <eos> 445 with piercing screams afflicted strangers mourn <eos> and their white ashes mingle in their urn <eos>

so if thou hadst been scorned in human eyes <eos> too bright and near to be a glory then <eos> if as truth 's artist , thou hadst been to men <eos> a setter forth of strange divinities <eos> to after times , thou , born in midday skies <eos> a sun , high up , out blazing sudden , when <eos> its light had had its centuries eight and ten <eos> to travel through the wretched void that lies <eos> ‘ twixt souls and truth , hadst been a love and fear <eos> worshipped on high from magian 's mountain crest <eos> and all night long symbol 'd by lamp flames clear <eos> thy sign , a star upon thy people 's breast <eos> where now a strange mysterious shape doth lie <eos> that once barred out the sun in noontide sky <eos>

england ! the time is come when thou shouldst wean <eos> thy heart from its emasculating food <eos> the truth should now be better understood <eos> old things have been unsettled ; we have seen <eos> fair seed time , better harvest might have been <eos> but for thy trespasses ; and , at this day <eos> if for greece , egypt , india , africa <eos> aught good were destined , thou wouldst step between <eos> england ! all nations in this charge agree <eos> but worse , more ignorant in love and hate <eos> far , far more abject is thine enemy <eos> therefore the wise pray for thee , though the freight <eos> of thy offences be a heavy weight <eos> oh grief ! that earth 's best hopes rest all with thee <eos>
patience , long sick to death , is dead . too long <eos> have sloth and doubt and treason bidden us be <eos> what cromwell 's england was not , when the sea <eos> to him bore witness given of blake how strong <eos> she stood , a commonweal that brooked no wrong <eos> from foes less vile than men like wolves set free <eos> whose war is waged where none may fight or flee <eos> with women and with weanlings . speech and song <eos> lack utterance now for loathing . scarce we hear <eos> foul tongues that blacken god 's dishonoured name <eos> with prayers turned curses and with praise found shame <eos> defy the truth whose witness now draws near <eos> to scourge these dogs , agape with jaws afoam <eos> down out of life . strike , england , and strike home <eos>

a face seen passing in a crowded street <eos> a voice heard singing music , large and free <eos> and from that moment life is changed , and we <eos> become of more heroic temper , meet <eos> to freely ask and give , a man complete <eos> radiant because of faith , we dare to be <eos> what nature meant us . brave idolatry <eos> which can conceive a hero ! no deceit <eos> no knowledge taught by unrelenting years <eos> can quench this fierce , untamable desire <eos> we know that what we long for once achieved <eos> will cease to satisfy . be still our fears <eos> if what we worship fail us , still the fire <eos> burns on , and it is much to have believed <eos>
you think me quite as good as other men <eos> nay , more , i think you think me vastly better <eos> your candid glances seem to ask me when <eos> i 'll seek to bind you in a willing fetter <eos> is this presumption ? not from friend to friend <eos> whose souls unite like clasping hands of lovers <eos> yet can i breathe no word of love , to end <eos> the delicate doubt that o'er the unspoken hovers <eos> if i were hopeless that you loved me not <eos> my hopeless love , confess 'd , myself would flatter <eos> but should the blissful dream be true , i wot <eos> that love confess 'd the joy of love would shatter <eos> my queen , indeed as king i 'd love to lord it <eos> i cannot tell you that i can n't afford it <eos>

cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep <eos> a maid of dian 's this advantage found <eos> and his love kindling fire did quickly steep <eos> in a cold valley fountain of that ground <eos> which borrowed from this holy fire of love <eos> a dateless lively heat still to endure <eos> and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove <eos> against strange maladies a sovereign cure <eos> but at my mistress ’ eye love 's brand new fired <eos> the boy for trial needs would touch my breast <eos> i sick withal the help of bath desired <eos> and thither hied a sad distempered guest <eos> but found no cure , the bath for my help lies <eos> where cupid got new fire ; my mistress ’ eyes <eos>

god hides in nature as a thought doth hide <eos> in humbly sounding words ; and as the thought <eos> beats through the lowly word like pulse of heart <eos> that giveth life and keepeth life alive <eos> so god , thro ’ nature , works on ev'ry soul <eos> for nature is his word so strangely writ <eos> in heav'n , in all the letters of the stars <eos> beneath the stars in alphabets of clouds <eos> and on the seas in syllables of waves <eos> and in the earth , on all the leaves of flowers <eos> and on the grasses and the stately trees <eos> and on the rivers and the mournful rocks <eos> the word is clearly written ; blest are they <eos> who read the word aright — and understand <eos>
hark you such sound as quivers ? kings will hear <eos> as kings have heard , and tremble on their thrones <eos> the old will feel the weight of mossy stones <eos> the young alone will laugh and scoff at fear <eos> it is the tread of armies marching near <eos> from scarlet lands to lands forever pale <eos> it is a bugle dying down the gale <eos> it is the sudden gushing of a tear <eos> and it is hands that grope at ghostly doors <eos> and romp of spirit children on the pave <eos> it is the tender sighing of the brave <eos> who fell , ah ! long ago , in futile wars <eos> it is such sound as death ; and , after all <eos> ‘ tis but the forest letting dead leaves fall <eos>
the shepherd on his journey heard when nigh <eos> his dog among the bushes barking high <eos> the ploughman ran and gave a hearty shout <eos> he found a weary fox and beat him out <eos> the ploughman laughed and would have ploughed him in <eos> but the old shepherd took him for the skin <eos> he lay upon the furrow stretched for dead <eos> the old dog lay and licked the wounds that bled <eos> the ploughman beat him till his ribs would crack <eos> and then the shepherd slung him at his back <eos> and when he rested , to his dog 's surprise <eos> the old fox started from his dead disguise <eos> and while the dog lay panting in the sedge <eos> he up and snapt and bolted through the hedge <eos>
beloved ! if i wander far and oft <eos> from that which i believe , and feel , and know <eos> thou wilt forgive , not with a sorrowing heart <eos> but with a strengthened hope of better things <eos> knowing that i , though often blind and false <eos> to those i love , and oh , more false than all <eos> unto myself , have been most true to thee <eos> and that whoso in one thing hath been true <eos> can be as true in all . therefore thy hope <eos> may yet not prove unfruitful , and thy love <eos> meet , day by day , with less unworthy thanks <eos> whether , as now , we journey hand in hand <eos> or , parted in the body , yet are one <eos> in spirit and the love of holy things <eos>

i feel myself endangered beyond reason <eos> my death already ‘ twixt the cup and lip <eos> because my proud desire through curs è d treason <eos> would make my hopes mount heaven , which cannot skip <eos> my fancy still requireth at my hands <eos> such things as are not , cannot , may not be <eos> and my desire although my power withstands <eos> will give me wings , who never yet could flee <eos> what then remains except my maim è d soul <eos> extort compassion from love flying age <eos> or if naught else their fury may control <eos> to call on death that quells affection 's rage <eos> which death shall dwell with me and never fly <eos> since vain desire seeks that hope doth deny <eos>
‘ twas on the morn ’ when heaven its blessed ray <eos> in pity to its suffering master veil 'd <eos> first did i , lady , to your beauty yield <eos> of your victorious eyes th ’ unguarded prey <eos> ah ! little reck 'd i that , on such a day <eos> needed against love 's arrows any shield <eos> and trod ’ securely trod , the fatal field <eos> whence , with the world 's , began my heart 's dismay <eos> on every side love found his victim bare <eos> and through mine eyes transfix 'd my throbbing heart <eos> those eyes , which now with constant sorrows flow <eos> but poor the triumph of his boasted art <eos> who thus could pierce a naked youth nor dare <eos> to you in armour mail 'd even to display his bow <eos>
dear heart and love ! what happiness to sit <eos> and watch the firelight 's varying shade and shine <eos> on thy young face ; and through those eyes of thine <eos> as through glad windows — mark fair fancies flit <eos> in sumptuous chambers of thy soul 's chaste wit <eos> like graceful women : then to take in mine <eos> thy hand , whose pressure brims my heart 's divine <eos> hushed rapture as with music exquisite <eos> when i remember how thy look and touch <eos> sway , like the moon , my blood with ecstasy <eos> i dare not think to what fierce heaven might lead <eos> thy soft embrace ; or in thy kiss how much <eos> sweet hell ,— beyond all help of me ,— might be <eos> where i were lost , where i were lost indeed <eos>
above , the sire of gods his thunder rolls <eos> and peals on peals redoubled rend the poles <eos> beneath , stern neptune shakes the solid ground <eos> the forests wave , the mountains nod around <eos> through all their summits tremble ida ’ s woods <eos> and from their sources boil her hundred floods <eos> troy ’ s turrets totter on the rocking plain <eos> and the toss ’ d navies beat the heaving main <eos> deep in the dismal regions of the dead <eos> the infernal monarch rear ’ d his horrid head <eos> leap ’ d from his throne , lest neptune ’ s arm should lay <eos> his dark dominions open to the day <eos> and pour in light on pluto ’ s drear abodes <eos> abhorr ’ d by men , and dreadful even to gods <eos>
o call not me to justify the wrong <eos> that thy unkindness lays upon my heart <eos> wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue <eos> use power with power , and slay me not by art <eos> tell me thou lov'st elsewhere ; but in my sight <eos> dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside <eos> what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might <eos> is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide <eos> let me excuse thee , ah my love well knows <eos> her pretty looks have been mine enemies <eos> and therefore from my face she turns my foes <eos> that they elsewhere might dart their injuries <eos> yet do not so , but since i am near slain <eos> kill me outright with looks , and rid my pain <eos>
ah ! who can e'er forget so fair a being <eos> who can forget her half retiring sweets <eos> god ! she is like a milk white lamb that bleats <eos> for man 's protection . surely the all seeing <eos> who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing <eos> will never give him pinions , who intreats <eos> such innocence to ruin ,— who vilely cheats <eos> a dove like bosom . in truth there is no freeing <eos> one 's thoughts from such a beauty ; when i hear <eos> a lay that once i saw her hand awake <eos> her form seems floating palpable , and near <eos> had i e'er seen her from an arbour take <eos> a dewy flower , oft would that hand appear <eos> and o'er my eyes the trembling moisture shake <eos>
if thou hadst been a poet ! on my heart <eos> the thought dashed . it recoiled , as , with the gift <eos> light blinded , and joy saddened , so bereft <eos> and the hot fountain tears , with sudden start <eos> thronged to mine eyes , as if with that same smart <eos> the husk of vision had in twain been cleft <eos> its hidden soul in naked beauty left <eos> and we beheld thee , nature , as thou art <eos> o poet , poet , poet ! at thy feet <eos> i should have lien , sainted with listening <eos> my pulses answering aye , in rhythmic beat <eos> each parting word that with melodious wing <eos> moved on , creating still my being sweet <eos> my soul thy harp , thy word the quivering string <eos>
guido , i would that lapo , thou , and i <eos> led by some strong enchantment , might ascend <eos> a magic ship , whose charmed sails should fly <eos> with winds at will where'er our thoughts might wend <eos> so that no change , nor any evil chance <eos> should mar our joyous voyage ; but it might be <eos> that even satiety should still enhance <eos> between our hearts their strict community <eos> and that the bounteous wizard then would place <eos> vanna and bice and my gentle love <eos> companions of our wandering , and would grace <eos> with passionate talk , wherever we might rove <eos> our time , and each were as content and free <eos> as i believe that thou and i should be <eos>
oft when my spirit doth spred her bolder winges <eos> in mind to mount up to the purest sky <eos> it down is weighd with thought of earthly things <eos> and clogd with burden of mortality <eos> where , when that soverayne beauty it doth spy <eos> resembling heavens glory in her light <eos> drawn with sweet pleasures bayt it back doth fly <eos> and unto heaven forgets her former flight <eos> there my fraile fancy , fed with full delight <eos> doth bathe in blisse , and mantlcth most at ease <eos> ne thinks of other heaven , but how it might <eos> her harts desire with most contentment please <eos> hart need not wish none other happinesse <eos> but here on earth to have such hevens blisse <eos>
for shelter here , to shun the noonday heat <eos> an airy nation of the flies retreat <eos> some in soft air their silken pinions ply <eos> and some from bough to bough delighted fly <eos> some rise , and circling light to perch again <eos> a pleasing murmur hums along the plain <eos> so , when a stage invites to pageant shows <eos> ( if great and small are like ) appear the beaux <eos> in boxes some with spruce pretension sit <eos> some change from seat to seat within the pit <eos> some roam the scenes , or turning cease to roam <eos> preluding music fills the lofty dome <eos> when thus a fly ( if what a fly can say <eos> deserves attention ) raised the rural lay <eos>
impelled by feelings in their nature kind <eos> but slightly weak and somewhat undefined <eos> rush at each other , make a sudden stand <eos> begin to talk , expatiate , and expand <eos> each looks quite radiant , seems extremely struck <eos> their meeting so was such a piece of luck <eos> each thinks the other thinks he ‘ s greatly pleased <eos> to screw the vice in which they both are squeezed <eos> so there they talk , in dust , or mud , or snow <eos> both bored to death , and both afraid to go <eos> your hat once lifted , do not hang your fire <eos> nor , like slow ajax , fighting still , retire <eos> when your old castor on your crown you clap <eos> go off ; you 've mounted your percussion cap <eos>
as a bad orator , badly o ’ er book skilled <eos> doth overflow his purpose with made heat <eos> and , like a clock , winds with withoutness willed <eos> what should have been an inner instinct ’ s feat <eos> or as a prose wit , harshly poet turned <eos> lacking the subtler music in his measure <eos> with useless care labours but to be spurned <eos> courting in alien speech the muse ’ s pleasure <eos> i study how to love or how to hate <eos> estranged by consciousness from sentiment <eos> with a thought feeling forced to be sedate <eos> even when the feeling ’ s nature is violent <eos> as who would learn to swim without the river <eos> when nearest to the trick , as far as ever <eos>

lawrence , what though the world be growing dark <eos> and twilight cool thy potent day inclose <eos> the sun , beneath the round earth sunk , still glows <eos> all the night through , sleepless and young and stark <eos> oh , be thy spirit faithful as the lark <eos> more daring : in the midnight of thy woes <eos> dart through them , higher than earth 's shadow goes <eos> into the light of which thou art a spark <eos> be willing to be blind — that , in thy night <eos> the lord may bring his father to thy door <eos> and enter in , and feast thy soul with light <eos> then shall thou dream of darksome ways no more <eos> forget the gloom that round thy windows lies <eos> and shine , god 's house , all radiant in our eyes <eos>
one gazed steadfast into the dying west <eos> with lips apart to greet the evening star <eos> and one with eyes that caught the strife and jar <eos> of the sea 's heart , followed the sunward breast <eos> of a lone gull ; from a slow harp one drew <eos> blind music like a laugh or like a wail <eos> and in the uncertain shadow of the sail <eos> one wove a crown of berries and of yew <eos> yet even as i said with dull desire <eos> “ all these were mine , and one was mine indeed <eos> the smoky music burst into a fire <eos> and i was left alone in my great need <eos> one foot upon the thin horn of my lyre <eos> and all its strings crushed in the dripping weed <eos>
among the ruffians that , allured by gain <eos> lurk 'd round the dwellings of the royal dane <eos> the horrid eminence a swede might claim <eos> a lawless wretch — olaus was his name <eos> his name , with darkest brand exalted high <eos> glared on the towering pitch of infamy <eos> twice , o'er his head ere thirty suns had roll 'd <eos> with shameless hand his freedom had he sold <eos> and twice in battle drawn his venal sword <eos> against a generous and forgiving lord <eos> successive crimes o'er nature soon prevail 'd <eos> and denmark 's king the perfect villain hail 'd <eos> bade his known skill each midnight treason guide <eos> and o'er each murdering band preside <eos>
these words the poet heard in paradise <eos> uttered by one who , bravely dying here <eos> in the true faith was living in that sphere <eos> where the celestial cross of sacrifice <eos> spread its protecting arms athwart the skies <eos> and set thereon , like jewels crystal clear <eos> the souls magnanimous , that knew not fear <eos> flashed their effulgence on his dazzled eyes <eos> ah me ! how dark the discipline of pain <eos> were not the suffering followed by the sense <eos> of infinite rest and infinite release <eos> this is our consolation ; and again <eos> a great soul cries to us in our suspense <eos> “ i came from martyrdom unto this peace <eos>
and thou , my village ! as again i tread <eos> amidst thy living and above thy dead <eos> though some fair playmates guard with charter fears <eos> their cheeks , grown holy with the lapse of years <eos> though with the dust some reverend locks may blend <eos> where life 's last mile stone marks the journey 's end <eos> on every bud the changing year recalls <eos> the brightening glance of morning memory falls <eos> still following onward as the months unclose <eos> the balmy lilac or the bridal rose <eos> and still shall follow , till they sink once more <eos> beneath the snow drifts of the frozen shore <eos> as when my bark , long tossing in the gale <eos> furled in her port her tempest rended sail <eos>
“ now through the rocks , appall 'd with deep dismay <eos> we bend our course , and stem the desperate way <eos> dire scylla there a scene of horror forms <eos> and here charybdis fills the deep with storms <eos> when the tide rushes from her rumbling caves <eos> the rough rock roars , tumultuous boil the waves <eos> they toss , they foam , a wild confusion raise <eos> like waters bubbling o'er the fiery blaze <eos> eternal mists obscure the aerial plain <eos> and high above the rock she spouts the main <eos> when in her gulfs the rushing sea subsides <eos> she drains the ocean with the refluent tides <eos> the rock re bellows with a thundering sound <eos> deep , wondrous deep , below appears the ground <eos>
“ fair truth alone ( the patient man replied <eos> my words shall dictate , and my lips shall guide <eos> to him , to me , one common lot was given <eos> in equal woes , alas ! involved by heaven <eos> much of his fates i know ; but check 'd by fear <eos> i stand ; the hand of violence is here <eos> here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade <eos> and injured suppliants seek in vain for aid <eos> let for a space the pensive queen attend <eos> nor claim my story till the sun descend <eos> then in such robes as suppliants may require <eos> composed and cheerful by the genial fire <eos> when loud uproar and lawless riot cease <eos> shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace <eos>
be nought dismayd that her unmoved mind <eos> doth still persist in her rebellious pride <eos> such love , not lyke to lusts of baser kynd <eos> the harder wonne , the firmer will abide <eos> the durefull oake whose sap is not yet dride <eos> is long ere it conceive the kindling fyre <eos> but when it once doth burne , it doth divide <eos> great heat , and makes his flames to heaven aspire <eos> so hard it is to kindle new desire <eos> in gentle brest , that shall endure for ever <eos> deepe is the wound that dints the parts entire <eos> with chaste affects , that naught but death can sever <eos> then thinke not long in taking litle paine <eos> to knit the knot that ever shall remaine <eos>
poor rod'rick now no other hope had got <eos> than what the chance of traffick might allot <eos> illusion vain , or doubtful at the best <eos> though some grow rich , yet all are not so blessed <eos> ‘ twas said our husband never would succeed <eos> and truly , such it seemed to be decreed <eos> his agents ( similar to those we see <eos> in modern days ) were with his treasure free <eos> his ships were wrecked ; his commerce came to naught <eos> deceived by knaves , of whom he well had thought <eos> obliged to borrow money , which to pay <eos> he was unable at th ’ appointed day <eos> he fled , and with a farmer shelter took <eos> where he might hope the bailiffs would not look <eos>
the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts <eos> and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts <eos> at this the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook <eos> a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look <eos> she sees , and trembles at th ’ approaching ill <eos> just in the jaws of ruin , and codille <eos> and now ( as oft in some distempered state <eos> on one nice trick depends the general fate <eos> an ace of hearts steps forth ; the king unseen <eos> lurked in her hand , and mourned his captive queen <eos> he springs to vengeance with an eager pace <eos> and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace <eos> the nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky <eos> the walls , the woods , and long canals reply <eos>
first did i fear , when first my love began <eos> possessed in fits by watchful jealousy <eos> i sought to keep what i by favour won <eos> and brooked no partner in my love to be <eos> but tyrant sickness fed upon my love <eos> and spread his ensigns , dyed with colour white <eos> then was suspicion glad for to remove <eos> and loving much did fear to lose her quite <eos> erect , fair sweet , the colors thou didst wear <eos> dislodge thy griefs ; the short'ners of content <eos> for now of life , not love , is all my fear <eos> lest life and love be both together spent <eos> live but , fair love , and banish thy disease <eos> and love , kind heart , both where and whom thou please <eos>
still mid the corpses and the blood fought on <eos> those glorious sons of gods , nor ever ceased <eos> from wrath of fight . but eris now inclined <eos> the fatal scales of battle , which no more <eos> were equal poised . beneath the breast bone then <eos> of godlike memnon plunged achilles ’ sword <eos> clear through his body all the dark blue blade <eos> leapt : suddenly snapped the silver cord of life <eos> down in a pool of blood he fell , and clashed <eos> his massy armour , and earth rang again <eos> then turned to flight his comrades panic struck <eos> and of his arms the myrmidons stripped the dead <eos> while fled the trojans , and achilles chased <eos> as whirlwind swift and mighty to destroy <eos>
ere greece soared , showering sovranties of light <eos> ere rome shook earth with her tremendous tread <eos> ere yon blue feasting sun god burst blood red <eos> beneath thee slept thy prodigy , o night <eos> aeons have ta'en like dreams their strange , slow flight <eos> and vastest , tiniest , creatures paved her bed <eos> e'en cities sapped by the usurping spread <eos> of her imperious waves have sunk from sight <eos> since she first chanted her colossal psalms <eos> that swell and sink beneath the listening stars <eos> oft , as with myriad drums beating to arms <eos> she thunders out the grandeur of her wars <eos> then shifts through moaning moods her wizard charms <eos> of slow flutes and caressing , gay guitars <eos>
on other shores , above their mouldering towns <eos> in sullen pomp the tall cathedral frowns <eos> pride in its aisles and paupers at the door <eos> which feeds the beggars whom it fleeced of yore <eos> simple and frail , our lowly temples throw <eos> their slender shadows on the paths below <eos> scarce steal the winds , that sweep his woodland tracks <eos> the larch 's perfume from the settler 's axe <eos> ere , like a vision of the morning air <eos> his slight — framed steeple marks the house of prayer <eos> its planks all reeking and its paint undried <eos> its rafters sprouting on the shady side <eos> it sheds the raindrops from its shingled eaves <eos> ere its green brothers once have changed their leaves <eos>
has she forgotten ? on this very may <eos> we were to meet here , with the birds and bees <eos> as on that sabbath , underneath the trees <eos> we strayed among the tombs , and stripped away <eos> the vines from these old granites , cold and gray <eos> and yet indeed not grim enough were they <eos> to stay our kisses , smiles and ecstasies <eos> or closer voice lost vows and rhapsodies <eos> has she forgotten — that the may has won <eos> its promise ?— that the bird songs from the tree <eos> are sprayed above the grasses as the sun <eos> might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly <eos> has she forgotten life — love — everyone <eos> has she forgotten me — forgotten me <eos>
what potions have i drunk of siren tears <eos> distilled from limbecks foul as hell within <eos> applying fears to hopes , and hopes to fears <eos> still losing when i saw my self to win <eos> what wretched errors hath my heart committed <eos> whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never <eos> how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted <eos> in the distraction of this madding fever <eos> o benefit of ill , now i find true <eos> that better is , by evil still made better <eos> and ruined love when it is built anew <eos> grows fairer than at first , more strong , far greater <eos> so i return rebuked to my content <eos> and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent <eos>
or whether doth my mind being crowned with you <eos> drink up the monarch 's plague this flattery <eos> or whether shall i say mine eye saith true <eos> and that your love taught it this alchemy <eos> to make of monsters , and things indigest <eos> such cherubins as your sweet self resemble <eos> creating every bad a perfect best <eos> as fast as objects to his beams assemble <eos> o ‘ tis the first , ‘ tis flattery in my seeing <eos> and my great mind most kingly drinks it up <eos> mine eye well knows what with his gust is ‘ greeing <eos> and to his palate doth prepare the cup <eos> if it be poisoned , ‘ tis the lesser sin <eos> that mine eye loves it and doth first begin <eos>
but hark !— from wood and rock flung back <eos> what sound comes up the merrimac <eos> what sea worn barks are those which throw <eos> the light spray from each rushing prow <eos> have they not in the north sea 's blast <eos> bowed to the waves the straining mast <eos> their frozen sails the low , pale sun <eos> of thule 's night has shone upon <eos> flapped by the sea wind 's gusty sweep <eos> round icy drift , and headland steep <eos> wild jutland 's wives and lochlin 's daughters <eos> have watched them fading o'er the waters <eos> lessening through driving mist and spray <eos> like white winged sea birds on their way <eos>
if faithful souls be alike glorified <eos> as angels , then my father 's soul doth see <eos> and adds this even to full felicity <eos> that valiantly i hell 's wide mouth o'erstride <eos> but if our minds to these souls be descried <eos> by circumstances and by signs that be <eos> apparent in us not immediately <eos> how shall my mind 's white truth by them be tried <eos> they see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn <eos> and style blasphemous conjurors to call <eos> on jesus ’ name , and pharisaical <eos> dissemblers feign devotion . then turn <eos> o pensive soul ! to god , for he knows best <eos> thy grief , for he put it into my breast <eos>
were this to happen now , scamander 's stream <eos> would not so easily preserve esteem <eos> but crimes like these ( whoever was abused <eos> in former days , were easily excused <eos> with time our maxims change , and what was then <eos> though wrong at present , may prevail agen <eos> scamander 's spouse some raillery received <eos> but in the end she fully was relieved <eos> a lover e'en superior thought her charms <eos> ( his taste was such ) and took her to his arms <eos> the gods can nothing spoil ! but should they cause <eos> a belle to lose a portion of applause <eos> a handsome fortune give , and you 'll behold <eos> that ev'ry thing can be repaired by gold <eos>
thus mourn 'd the hapless man : a thundering sound <eos> roll 'd thro the shuddering walls and shook the ground <eos> o'er all the dungeon , where black arches bend <eos> the roofs unfold , and streams of light descend <eos> the growing splendor fills the astonish 'd room <eos> and gales etherial breathe a glad perfume <eos> robed in the radiance , moves a form serene <eos> of human structure , but of heavenly mien <eos> near to the prisoner 's couch he takes his stand <eos> and waves , in sign of peace , his holy hand <eos> tall rose his stature , youth 's endearing grace <eos> adorn 'd his limbs and brighten 'd in his face <eos> loose o'er his locks the star of evening hung <eos> and sounds melodious moved his cheerful tongue <eos>
thought was born blind , but thought knows what is seeing <eos> its careful touch , deciphering forms from shapes <eos> still suggests form as aught whose proper being <eos> mere finding touch with erring darkness drapes <eos> yet whence , except from guessed sight , does touch teach <eos> that touch is but a close and empty sense <eos> how does mere touch , self uncontented , reach <eos> for some truer sense ’ s whole intelligence <eos> the thing once touched , if touch be now omitted <eos> stands yet in memory real and outward known <eos> so the untouching memory of touch is fitted <eos> with sense of a sense whereby far things are shown <eos> so , by touch of untouching , wrongly aright <eos> touch ’ thought of seeing sees not things but sight <eos>
as an old mercer in some sleepy town <eos> swings wide his windows new day after day <eos> sets all his wares around in arch array <eos> to please the taste of passers up and down <eos> his hoard of handy things of trite renown <eos> of sweets and spices and of faint perfumes <eos> of silks and prints ,— and at the last illumes <eos> his tiny panes to foil the evening 's frown <eos> so nature spreads her proffered treasures : such <eos> as daily dazzle at the morning 's rise <eos> fair show of isle and ocean merchandise <eos> and airy offerings filmy to the touch <eos> then , lest we like not these , in dark 's bazaars <eos> she nightly tempts us with her store of stars <eos>
thou cam'st not to thy place by accident <eos> it is the very place god meant for thee <eos> and shouldst thou there small scope for action see <eos> do not for this give room to discontent <eos> nor let the time thou owest god be spent <eos> in idle dreaming how thou mightest be <eos> in what concerns thy spiritual life , more free <eos> from outward hindrance or impediment <eos> for presently this hindrance thou shalt find <eos> that without which all goodness were a task <eos> so slight that virtue never could grow strong <eos> and wouldst thou do one duty to his mind <eos> the imposer 's — over burdened thou shalt ask <eos> and own thy need of , grace to help ere long <eos>
meanwhile the new companions past away <eos> far o'er the long backs of the bushless downs <eos> to where sir lancelot knew there lived a knight <eos> not far from camelot , now for forty years <eos> a hermit , who had prayed , laboured and prayed <eos> and ever labouring had scooped himself <eos> in the white rock a chapel and a hall <eos> on massive columns , like a shorecliff cave <eos> and cells and chambers : all were fair and dry <eos> the green light from the meadows underneath <eos> struck up and lived along the milky roofs <eos> and in the meadows tremulous aspen trees <eos> and poplars made a noise of falling showers <eos> and thither wending there that night they bode <eos>
thou yellow trumpeter of laggard spring <eos> thou herald of rich summer 's myriad flowers <eos> the climbing sun with new recovered powers <eos> does warm thee into being , through the ring <eos> of rich , brown earth he woos thee , makes thee fling <eos> thy green shoots up , inheriting the dowers <eos> of bending sky and sudden , sweeping showers <eos> till ripe and blossoming thou art a thing <eos> to make all nature glad , thou art so gay <eos> to fill the lonely with a joy untold <eos> nodding at every gust of wind to day <eos> to morrow jewelled with raindrops . always bold <eos> to stand erect , full in the dazzling play <eos> of april 's sun , for thou hast caught his gold <eos>
when in the widening circle of rebirth <eos> to a new flesh my travelled soul shall come <eos> and try again the unremembered earth <eos> with the old sadness for the immortal home <eos> shall i revisit these same differing fields <eos> and cull the old new flowers with the same sense <eos> that some small breath of foiled remembrance yields <eos> of more age than my days in this pretence <eos> shall i again regret strange faces lost <eos> of which the present memory is forgot <eos> and but in unseen bulks of vagueness tossed <eos> out of the closed sea and black night of thought <eos> were thy face one , what sweetness will ’ t not be <eos> though by blind feeling , to remember thee <eos>

with all the fairest angels nearest god <eos> the ineffable true of heart around the throne <eos> there shall i find you waiting when the flown <eos> dream leaves my heart insentient as the clod <eos> and when the grief retracing ways i trod <eos> become a shining path to thee alone <eos> my weary feet , that seemed to drag as stone <eos> shall once again , with wings of fleetness shod <eos> fare on , beloved , to find you ! just beyond <eos> the seraph throng await me , standing near <eos> the gentler angels , eager and apart <eos> be there , near god 's own fairest , with the fond <eos> sweet smile that was your own , and let me hear <eos> your voice again and clasp you to my heart <eos>
vi . “ but yet the great of soul have ever been <eos> the first to glory in all works of art <eos> for from the genius form would ever dart <eos> a light of inspiration , and a sheen <eos> as of new comings ; and ourselves have seen <eos> men of stern purpose to whose eyes would start <eos> sorrow at sight of sorrow though no heart <eos> did riot underneath that chilly , screen <eos> and hence we judge such utterance native to <eos> the human soul — expression highest — best <eos> — nay , it is by such sign they will pursue <eos> albeit unknowing , beauty , without rest <eos> and failing in the search , themselves will fling <eos> speechless before its shadow , worshipping <eos>

low in the west , a banner floating wide <eos> of god 's own colors hangs in dreamy pride <eos> a wealth of purple stains and gleams of gold <eos> a crimson splendor o'er each waving fold <eos> a heap of gold — a rim of amethyst <eos> a hanging cloud by glancing sunbeams kissed <eos> afar upon the tinted , azure skies <eos> a tiny cloud of rosy color lies <eos> a coral on a velvet robe of blue <eos> a warm , bright wave upon the skies ’ pale hue <eos> oh ! such the sunset sky of italy <eos> the land of dreams , of love and melody <eos> the country of the passions and the heart <eos> the mother of th ’ ideal and of art <eos>

oft have we trod the vales of castaly <eos> and heard sweet notes of sylvan music blown <eos> from antique reeds to common folk unknown <eos> and often launched our bark upon that sea <eos> which the nine muses hold in empery <eos> and ploughed free furrows through the wave and foam <eos> nor spread reluctant sail for more safe home <eos> till we had freighted well our argosy <eos> of which despoiled treasures these remain <eos> sordello 's passion , and the honeyed line <eos> of young endymion , lordly tamburlaine <eos> driving his pampered jades , and more than these <eos> the seven fold vision of the florentine <eos> and grave browed milton 's solemn harmonies <eos>
as sheep , that step from forth their fold , by one <eos> or pairs , or three at once ; meanwhile the rest <eos> stand fearfully , bending the eye and nose <eos> to ground , and what the foremost does , that do <eos> the others , gath'ring round her , if she stops <eos> simple and quiet , nor the cause discern <eos> so saw i moving to advance the first <eos> who of that fortunate crew were at the head <eos> of modest mien and graceful in their gait <eos> when they before me had beheld the light <eos> from my right side fall broken on the ground <eos> so that the shadow reach 'd the cave , they stopp 'd <eos> and somewhat back retir 'd : the same did all <eos> who follow 'd , though unweeting of the cause <eos>
but thou ( since nature bids ) the world resign <eos> ‘ tis now thy daughter 's daughter 's time to shine <eos> with more address , ( or such as pleases more <eos> she runs her female exercises o'er <eos> unfurls or closes , raps or turns the fan <eos> and smiles , or blushes at the creature man <eos> with quicker life , as gilded coaches pass <eos> in sideling courtesy she drops the glass <eos> with better strength , on visit days she bears <eos> to mount her fifty flights of ample stairs <eos> her mien , her shape , her temper , eyes and tongue <eos> are sure to conquer — for the rogue is young <eos> and all that 's madly wild , or oddly gay <eos> we call it only pretty fanny 's way <eos>

“ tweet ” pipes the robin as the cat creeps by <eos> her nestling young that in the elderns lie <eos> and then the bluecap tootles in its glee <eos> picking the flies from orchard apple tree <eos> and “ pink ” the chaffinch cries its well known strain <eos> urging its kind to utter “ pink ” again <eos> while in a quiet mood hedgesparrows try <eos> an inward stir of shadowed melody <eos> around the rotten tree the firetail mourns <eos> as the old hedger to his toil returns <eos> chopping the grain to stop the gap close by <eos> the hole where her blue eggs in safety lie <eos> of everything that stirs she dreameth wrong <eos> and pipes her “ tweet tut ” fears the whole day long <eos>

o ye who loved our grandmothers of yore <eos> fitzpatrick , sheridan , and many more <eos> and thou , my prince ! whose sovereign taste and will <eos> it is to love the lovely beldames still <eos> thou ghost of queensbury ! whose judging sprite <eos> satan may spare to peep a single night <eos> pronounce — if ever in your days of bliss <eos> asmodeus struck so bright a stroke as this <eos> to teach the young ideas how to rise <eos> flush in the cheek , and languish in the eyes <eos> rush to the heart , and lighten through the frame <eos> with half told wish and ill dissembled flame <eos> for prurient nature still will storm the breast <eos> who , tempted thus , can answer for the rest <eos>
christ , dost thou live indeed ? or are thy bones <eos> still straitened in their rock hewn sepulchre <eos> and was thy rising only dreamed by her <eos> whose love of thee for all her sin atones <eos> for here the air is horrid with men 's groans <eos> the priests who call upon thy name are slain <eos> dost thou not hear the bitter wail of pain <eos> from those whose children lie upon the stones <eos> come down , o son of god ! incestuous gloom <eos> curtains the land , and through the starless night <eos> over thy cross a crescent moon i see <eos> if thou in very truth didst burst the tomb <eos> come down , o son of man ! and show thy might <eos> lest mahomet be crowned instead of thee <eos>

i love to see the old heath 's withered brake <eos> mingle its crimpled leaves with furze and ling <eos> while the old heron from the lonely lake <eos> starts slow and flaps his melancholy wing <eos> and oddling crow in idle motions swing <eos> on the half rotten ashtree 's topmost twig <eos> beside whose trunk the gipsy makes his bed <eos> up flies the bouncing woodcock from the brig <eos> where a black quagmire quakes beneath the tread <eos> the fieldfares chatter in the whistling thorn <eos> and for the awe round fields and closen rove <eos> and coy bumbarrels twenty in a drove <eos> flit down the hedgerows in the frozen plain <eos> and hang on little twigs and start again <eos>
he faced his canvas ( as a seer whose ken <eos> pierces the crust of this existence through <eos> and smiled beyond on that his genius knew <eos> ere mated with his being . conscious then <eos> of his high theme alone , he smiled again <eos> straight back upon himself in many a hue <eos> and tint , and light and shade , which slowly grew <eos> enfeatured of a fair girl 's face , as when <eos> first time she smiles for love 's sake with no fear <eos> so wrought he , witless that behind him leant <eos> a woman , with old features , dim and sear <eos> and glamoured eyes that felt the brimming tear <eos> and with a voice , like some sad instrument <eos> that sighing said , “ i 'm dead there ; love me here <eos>

dear cymru , mid thy mountains soaring high <eos> dwells genius , basking on thy quiet air <eos> and heavenly shades , and solitude more rare <eos> and all wrapt round with fullest harmony <eos> of streams which fall afar . thus pleasantly <eos> ‘ neath nature their fit foster mother 's care <eos> thy children learn from infant hours to bear <eos> and work the will of god . thy scenery <eos> so varied wild , so strangely sweet and strong <eos> works on them and to music moulds their mind <eos> till flows their fancy in poetic rills <eos> the voice of nature breathes in every song <eos> and we may read therein thy features kind <eos> as in some tarn that nestles ‘ neath thy hills <eos>
were't aught to me i bore the canopy <eos> with my extern the outward honouring <eos> or laid great bases for eternity <eos> which proves more short than waste or ruining <eos> have i not seen dwellers on form and favour <eos> lose all , and more by paying too much rent <eos> for compound sweet ; forgoing simple savour <eos> pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent <eos> no , let me be obsequious in thy heart <eos> and take thou my oblation , poor but free <eos> which is not mixed with seconds , knows no art <eos> but mutual render , only me for thee <eos> hence , thou suborned informer , a true soul <eos> when most impeached , stands least in thy control <eos>
thousands of thousands of hushed years ago <eos> out on the edge of chaos , all alone <eos> i stood on peaks of vapor , high upthrown <eos> above a sea that knew nor ebb nor flow <eos> nor any motion won of winds that blow <eos> nor any sound of watery wail or moan <eos> nor lisp of wave , nor wandering undertone <eos> of any tide lost in the night below <eos> so still it was , i mind me , as i laid <eos> my thirsty ear against mine own faint sigh <eos> to drink of that , i sipped it , half afraid <eos> ‘ twas but the ghost of a dead voice spilled by <eos> the one starved star that tottered through the shade <eos> and came tiptoeing toward me down the sky <eos>
such prayers last year were put up for thy sake <eos> what shall this year do that hath lived to see <eos> the piteous and unpitied end of thee <eos> what moan , what cry , what clamour shall it make <eos> seeing as a reed breaks all thine empire break <eos> and all thy great strength as a rotten tree <eos> whose branches made broad night from sea to sea <eos> and the world shuddered when a leaf would shake <eos> from the unknown deep wherein those prayers were heard <eos> from the dark height of time there sounds a word <eos> crying , comfort ; though death ride on this red hour <eos> hope waits with eyes that make the morning dim <eos> till liberty , reclothed with love and power <eos> shall pass and know not if she tread on him <eos>
“ dear mother ida , hearken ere i die <eos> they came , they cut away my tallest pines <eos> my dark tall pines , that plumed the craggy ledge <eos> high over the blue gorge , or lower down <eos> filling greengulph è d ida , all between <eos> the snowy peak and snowwhite cataract <eos> fostered the callow eaglet — from beneath <eos> whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark <eos> the panther 's roar came muffled , while i sat <eos> low in the valley . never , nevermore <eos> shall lone  none see the morning mist <eos> sweep thro ’ them — never see them overlaid <eos> with narrow moon lit slips of silver cloud <eos> between the loud stream and the trembling stars <eos>
but enoch yearn 'd to see her face again <eos> ‘ if i might look on her sweet face again <eos> and know that she is happy . ’ so the thought <eos> haunted and harass 'd him , and drove him forth <eos> at evening when the dull november day <eos> was growing duller twilight , to the hill <eos> there he sat down gazing on all below <eos> there did a thousand memories roll upon him <eos> unspeakable for sadness . by and by <eos> the ruddy square of comfortable light <eos> far blazing from the rear of philip 's house <eos> allured him , as the beacon blaze allures <eos> the bird of passage , till he madly strikes <eos> against it , and beats out his weary life <eos>
this door you might not open , and you did <eos> so enter now , and see for what slight thing <eos> you are betrayed . . . . here is no treasure hid <eos> no cauldron , no clear crystal mirroring <eos> the sought for truth , no heads of women slain <eos> for greed like yours , no writhings of distress <eos> but only what you see . . . . look yet again <eos> an empty room , cobwebbed and comfortless <eos> yet this alone out of my life i kept <eos> unto myself , lest any know me quite <eos> and you did so profane me when you crept <eos> unto the threshold of this room to night <eos> that i must never more behold your face <eos> this now is yours . i seek another place <eos>
my reason absent did mine eyes require <eos> to watch and ward and such foes to descry <eos> as they should ne'er my heart approaching spy <eos> but traitor eyes my heart 's death did conspire <eos> corrupted with hope 's gifts ; let in desire <eos> to burn my heart ; and sought no remedy <eos> though store of water were in either eye <eos> which well employed , might well have quenched the fire <eos> reason return è d ; love and fortune made <eos> judges , to judge mine eyes to punishment <eos> fortune , sith they by sight my heart betrayed <eos> from wish è d sight , adjudged them banishment <eos> love , sith by fire murdered my heart was found <eos> adjudg è d them in tears for to be drowned <eos>
‘ tis bed time ; say your hymn , and bid “ good night <eos> “ god bless mamma , papa , and dear ones all <eos> your half shut eyes beneath your eye lids fall <eos> another minute you will shut them quite <eos> yes , i will carry you , put out the light <eos> and tuck you up , although you are so tall <eos> what will you give me , sleepy one , and call <eos> my wages , if i settle you all right <eos> i laid her golden curls upon my arm <eos> i drew her little feet within my hand <eos> her rosy palms were joined in trustful bliss <eos> her heart next mine , beat gently , soft and warm <eos> she nestled to me , and , by love 's command <eos> paid me my precious wages ,— baby 's kiss <eos>
i am so weary with the burden old <eos> of foregone faults , and power of custom base <eos> that much i fear to perish from the ways <eos> and fall into my enemy 's grim fold <eos> true , a high friend , to free me , not with gold <eos> came , of ineffable and utmost grace <eos> then straightway vanished from before my face <eos> so that in vain i strive him to behold <eos> but his voice yet comes echoing below <eos> o ye that labour , the way open lies <eos> come unto me lest some one shut the gate <eos> — what heavenly grace — what love will — or what fate <eos> the pinions of a dove on me bestow <eos> that i may rest , and from the earth arise <eos>
poets did feign that heavens a venus had <eos> matchless herself , and cupid was her son <eos> men sued to these , and of their smiles were glad <eos> by whom so many famous were undone <eos> now cupid mourns that he hath lost his might <eos> and that these two so comely are to see <eos> and venus frowns because they have her right <eos> yet both so like that both shall blameless be <eos> with heaven 's two twins for godhead these may strive <eos> and rule a world with least part of a frown <eos> fairer than these two twins are not alive <eos> both conquering queens , and both deserve a crown <eos> my thoughts presage , which time to come shall try <eos> that thousands conquered for their love shall die <eos>
when most i wink then do mine eyes best see <eos> for all the day they view things unrespected <eos> but when i sleep , in dreams they look on thee <eos> and darkly bright , are bright in dark directed <eos> then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright <eos> how would thy shadow 's form , form happy show <eos> to the clear day with thy much clearer light <eos> when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so <eos> how would ( i say ) mine eyes be blessed made <eos> by looking on thee in the living day <eos> when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade <eos> through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay <eos> all days are nights to see till i see thee <eos> and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me <eos>
fair grace of graces , muse of muses all <eos> thou paradise , thou only heaven i know <eos> what influence hath bred my hateful woe <eos> that i from thee and them am forced to fall <eos> thou falled from me , from thee i never shall <eos> although my fortunes thou hast brought so low <eos> yet shall my faith and service with thee go <eos> for live i do , on heaven and thee to call <eos> banish 'd all grace , no graces with me dwell <eos> compelled to muse , my muses from me fly <eos> excluded heaven , what can remain but hell <eos> exiled from paradise , in hate i lie <eos> cursing my stars ; albeit i find it true <eos> i lost all these when i lost love and you <eos>
i stand again on the familiar shore <eos> and hear the waves of the distracted sea <eos> piteously calling and lamenting thee <eos> and waiting restless at thy cottage door <eos> the rocks , the sea weed on the ocean floor <eos> the willows in the meadow , and the free <eos> wild winds of the atlantic welcome me <eos> then why shouldst thou be dead , and come no more <eos> ah , why shouldst thou be dead , when common men <eos> are busy with their trivial affairs <eos> having and holding ? why , when thou hadst read <eos> nature 's mysterious manuscript , and then <eos> wast ready to reveal the truth it bears <eos> why art thou silent ! why shouldst thou be dead <eos>
at last , beloved nature ! i have met <eos> thee face to face upon thy breezy hills <eos> and boldly , where thy inmost bowers are set <eos> gazed on thee naked in thy mountain rills <eos> when first i felt thy breath upon my brow <eos> tears of strange ecstasy gushed out like rain <eos> and with a longing , passionate as vain <eos> i strove to clasp thee . but , i know not how <eos> always before me didst thou seem to glide <eos> and often from one sunny mountain side <eos> upon the next bright peak i saw thee kneel <eos> and heard thy voice upon the billowy blast <eos> but , climbing , only reached that shrine to feel <eos> the shadow of a presence which had passed <eos>
but who , half sceptic , half afraid of wrong <eos> shall walk our streets , and mark the passing throng <eos> the brawny oaf in mould herculean cast <eos> the pigmy statesman trembling in his blast <eos> the cumb'rous citizen of portly paunch <eos> unwont to soar beyond the smoaking haunch <eos> the meagre bard behind the moving tun <eos> his shadow seeming lengthen 'd by the sun <eos> who forms scarce visible shall thus descry <eos> like flitting clouds athwart the mental sky <eos> from giant bodies then bare gleams of mind <eos> like mountain watch lights blinking to the wind <eos> nor blush to find his unperverted eye <eos> flash on his heart , and give his tongue the lie <eos>
when i have fears that i may cease to be <eos> before my pen has glean 'd my teeming brain <eos> before high piled books , in charactery <eos> hold like rich garners the full ripen 'd grain <eos> when i behold , upon the night 's starr 'd face <eos> huge cloudy symbols of a high romance <eos> and think that i may never live to trace <eos> their shadows , with the magic hand of chance <eos> and when i feel , fair creature of an hour <eos> that i shall never look upon thee more <eos> never have relish in the faery power <eos> of unreflecting love ;— then on the shore <eos> of the wide world i stand alone , and think <eos> till love and fame to nothingness do sink <eos>
the old house totters ‘ neath its weight of years <eos> bowed , like the form of him who shelters there <eos> old , friendless , lone — save for the wanton , care <eos> who flouts him , mocks his grief with gibes and jeers <eos> and laughs to see his piteous hopes grow fears <eos> not his the joy of placid , sun crowned age <eos> his dim eyes falter as he scans the page <eos> of life 's worn album , blotted with his tears <eos> he sees in dreams the wife he loved — long dead <eos> the son — once proud to bear his father 's name <eos> who mixed his honest blood with dire disgrace <eos> the wayward girl who wrought her father shame <eos> he sits alone with care ; the day has fled <eos> and twilight falls , upon the furrowed face <eos>
my grief begun , fair saint , when first i saw <eos> love in those eyes sit ruling with disdain <eos> whose sweet commands did keep a world in awe <eos> and caused them serve your favor to obtain <eos> i stood as one enchanted with a frown <eos> yet smiled to see all creatures serve those eyes <eos> where each with sighs paid tribute to that crown <eos> and thought them grac è d by your dumb replies <eos> but i , ambitious , could not be content <eos> till that my service more than sighs made known <eos> and for that end my heart to you i sent <eos> to say and swear that , fair , it is your own <eos> then greater graces , licia , do impart <eos> not dumb replies unto a speaking heart <eos>
his house was known to all the vagrant train <eos> he chid their wanderings , but relieved their pain <eos> the long remembered beggar was his guest <eos> whose beard , descending , swept his aged breast <eos> the ruined spendthrift , now no longer proud <eos> claimed kindred there , and had his claims allowed <eos> the broken soldier , kindly bade to stay <eos> sat by his fire and talked the night away <eos> wept o'er his wounds , or , tales of sorrow done <eos> shouldered his crutch , and showed how fields were won <eos> pleased with his guests , the good man learned to glow <eos> and quite forgot their vices in their woe <eos> careless their merits or their faults to scan <eos> his pity gave ere charity began <eos>
i served my sentence — a bitter pill <eos> some fellows should take who never will <eos> and then i decided to go “ out west <eos> concludin ’ ‘ twould suit my health the best <eos> where , how i prospered , i never could tell <eos> but fortune seemed to like we [ me ] well <eos> an ’ somehow every vein i struck <eos> was always bubblin ’ over with luck <eos> an ’ , better than that , i was steady an ’ true <eos> an ’ put my good resolutions through <eos> but i wrote to a trusty old neighbor , an ’ said <eos> “ you tell ‘ em , old fellow , that i am dead <eos> an ’ died a christian ; ‘ twill please ‘ em more <eos> than if i had lived the same as before <eos>
he needs no praise of us , who wrought so well <eos> who has the master 's praise ; who at his post <eos> stood to the last . yet , now , from coast to coast <eos> let memory of him peal like some great bell <eos> of him as woodsman , workman , let it tell <eos> of him as lawyer , statesman , without boast <eos> and for what qualities we love him most <eos> and recollections that no time can quell <eos> he needs no praise of us , yet let us praise <eos> albeit his simple soul we may offend <eos> that liked not praise , being most diffident <eos> still let us praise him , praise him in such ways <eos> as his were , and in words that shall transcend <eos> marble , and outlast any monument <eos>
there is no picturesqueness and no glory <eos> no halo of romance , in war to day <eos> it is a hideous thing ; time would turn grey <eos> with horror , were he not already hoary <eos> at sight of this vile monster , foul and gory <eos> yet while sweet women perish as they pray <eos> and new born babes are slaughtered , who dare say <eos> ‘ halt ! ’ till right pens its ‘ finis ’ to the story <eos> there is no pathway , but the path through blood <eos> out of the horrors of this holocaust <eos> hell has let loose its scalding crimson flood <eos> and he who stops to argue now is lost <eos> not brooms of creeds , not pacifistic words <eos> can stem the tide , but swords — uplifted swords <eos>
then i again inquir 'd : “ where flow the streams <eos> of phlegethon and lethe ? for of one <eos> thou tell'st not , and the other of that shower <eos> thou say'st , is form 'd . ” he answer thus return 'd <eos> “ doubtless thy questions all well pleas 'd i hear <eos> yet the red seething wave might have resolv 'd <eos> one thou proposest . lethe thou shalt see <eos> but not within this hollow , in the place <eos> whither to lave themselves the spirits go <eos> whose blame hath been by penitence remov 'd <eos> he added : “ time is now we quit the wood <eos> look thou my steps pursue : the margins give <eos> safe passage , unimpeded by the flames <eos> for over them all vapour is extinct <eos>
in attica thy birthplace should have been <eos> or the ionian isles , or where the seas <eos> encircle in their arms the cyclades <eos> so wholly greek wast thou in thy serene <eos> and childlike joy of life , o philhellene <eos> around thee would have swarmed the attic bees <eos> homer had been thy friend , or socrates <eos> and plato welcomed thee to his demesne <eos> for thee old legends breathed historic breath <eos> thou sawest poseidon in the purple sea <eos> and in the sunset jason 's fleece of gold <eos> o , what hadst thou to do with cruel death <eos> who wast so full of life , or death with thee <eos> that thou shouldst die before thou hadst grown old <eos>
aloof within the day 's enormous dome <eos> he holds unshared the silence of the sky <eos> far down his bleak , relentless eyes descry <eos> the eagle 's empire and the falcon 's home <eos> far down , the galleons of sunset roam <eos> his hazards on the sea of morning lie <eos> serene , he hears the broken tempest sigh <eos> where cold sierras gleam like scattered foam <eos> and least of all he holds the human swarm <eos> unwitting now that envious men prepare <eos> to make their dream and its fulfillment one <eos> when , poised above the caldrons of the storm <eos> their hearts , contemptuous of death , shall dare <eos> his roads between the thunder and the sun <eos>
to stab my youth with desperate knives , to wear <eos> this paltry age 's gaudy livery <eos> to let each base hand filch my treasury <eos> to mesh my soul within a woman 's hair <eos> and be mere fortune 's lackeyed groom ,— i swear <eos> i love it not ! these things are less to me <eos> than the thin foam that frets upon the sea <eos> less than the thistledown of summer air <eos> which hath no seed : better to stand aloof <eos> far from these slanderous fools who mock my life <eos> knowing me not , better the lowliest roof <eos> fit for the meanest hind to sojourn in <eos> than to go back to that hoarse cave of strife <eos> where my white soul first kissed the mouth of sin <eos>
thus mortal war was wag 'd on either side <eos> meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide <eos> for , anxious , from evander when he went <eos> he sought the tyrrhene camp , and tarchon 's tent <eos> expos 'd the cause of coming to the chief <eos> his name and country told , and ask 'd relief <eos> propos 'd the terms ; his own small strength declar 'd <eos> what vengeance proud mezentius had prepar 'd <eos> what turnus , bold and violent , design 'd <eos> then shew 'd the slipp'ry state of humankind <eos> and fickle fortune ; warn 'd him to beware <eos> and to his wholesome counsel added pray'r <eos> tarchon , without delay , the treaty signs <eos> and to the trojan troops the tuscan joins <eos>

if truth there be in old cratinus ’ song <eos> no verse , you know , maecenas , can live long <eos> writ by a water drinker . since the day <eos> when bacchus took us poets into pay <eos> with fauns and satyrs , the celestial nine <eos> have smelt each morning of last evening 's wine <eos> the praises heaped by homer on the bowl <eos> at once convict him as a thirsty soul <eos> and father ennius ne'er could be provoked <eos> to sing of battles till his lips were soaked <eos> “ let temperate folk write verses in the hall <eos> where bonds change hands , abstainers not at all <eos> so ran my edict : now the clan drinks hard <eos> and vinous breath distinguishes a bard <eos>
thou hast made me , and shall thy work decay <eos> repair me now , for now mine end doth haste <eos> i run to death , and death meets me as fast <eos> and all my pleasures are like yesterday <eos> i dare not move my dim eyes any way <eos> despair behind , and death before doth cast <eos> such terror ; and my feeble flesh doth waste <eos> by sin in it , which it towards hell doth weigh <eos> only them art above , and when towards thee <eos> by thy leave i can look , i rise again <eos> but our old subtle foe so tempteth me <eos> that not one hour myself i can sustain <eos> thy grace may wing me to prevent his art <eos> and thou like adamant draw mine iron heart <eos>

ay ! it was so ; and julio had fain <eos> have been a warrior ; but his very brain <eos> grew fever 'd at the sickly thought of death <eos> and to be stricken with a want of breath <eos> to be the food of worms — inanimate <eos> and cold as winter ,— and as desolate <eos> and then to waste away , and be no more <eos> than the dark dust !— the thought was like a sore <eos> that gather 'd in his heart ; and he would say <eos> “ a curse be on their laurels ! ” and decay <eos> came over them ; the deeds that they had done <eos> had fallen with their fortunes ; and anon <eos> was julio forgotten , and his line <eos> no wonder for this frenzied tale of mine <eos>
the frightened herds of clouds across the sky <eos> trample the sunshine down , and chase the day <eos> into the dusky forest lands of gray <eos> and sombre twilight . far and faint , and high <eos> the wild goose trails his harrow , with a cry <eos> sad as the wail of some poor castaway <eos> who sees a vessel drifting far astray <eos> of his last hope , and lays him down to die <eos> the children , riotous from school , grow bold <eos> and quarrel with the wind whose angry gust <eos> plucks off the summer hat , and flaps the fold <eos> of many a crimson cloak , and twirls the dust <eos> in spiral shapes grotesque , and dims the gold <eos> of gleaming tresses with the blur of rust <eos>
there shone a comet , and it was full west <eos> my thoughts presag è d what it did portend <eos> i found it threatened to my heart unrest <eos> and might in time my joys and comfort end <eos> i further sought and found it was a sun <eos> which day nor night did never use to set <eos> it constant stood when heavens did restless run <eos> and did their virtues and their forces let <eos> the world did muse and wonder what it meant <eos> a sun to shine and in the west to rise <eos> to search the truth , i strength and spirits spent <eos> at length i found it was my licia 's eyes <eos> now never after soul shall live in dark <eos> that hath the hap this western sun to mark <eos>
happy the maimed , the halt , the mad , the blind <eos> all who , stamped separate by curtailing birth <eos> owe no duty ’ s allegiance to mankind <eos> nor stand a valuing in their scheme of worth <eos> but i , whom fate , not nature , did curtail <eos> by no exterior voidness being exempt <eos> must bear accusing glances where i fail <eos> fixed in the general orbit of contempt <eos> fate , less than nature in being kind to lacking <eos> giving the ill , shows not as outer cause <eos> making our mock free will the mirror ’ s backing <eos> which fate ’ s own acts as if in itself shows <eos> and men , like children , seeing the image there <eos> take place for cause and make our will fate bear <eos>
if in the summer of thy bright regard <eos> for one brief season these poor rhymes shall live <eos> i ask no more , nor think my fate too hard <eos> if other eyes but wintry looks should give <eos> nor will i grieve though what i here have writ <eos> o'erburdened time should drop among the ways <eos> and to the unremembering dust commit <eos> beyond the praise and blame of other days <eos> the song doth pass , but i who sing , remain <eos> i pluck from death 's own heart a life more deep <eos> and as the spring , that dies not , in her train <eos> doth scatter blossoms for the winds to reap <eos> so i , immortal , as i fare along <eos> will strew my path with mortal flowers of song <eos>
when these sad sights were overpast and gone <eos> my spright was greatly moved in her rest <eos> with inward ruth and deare affection <eos> to see so great things by so small distrest <eos> thenceforth i gan in my engrieved brest <eos> to scorne all difference of great and small <eos> sith that the greatest often are opprest <eos> and unawares doe into daunger fall <eos> and ye , that read these ruines tragicall <eos> learne , by their losse , to love the low degree <eos> and if that fortune chaunce you up to call <eos> to honours seat , forget not what you be <eos> for he that of himselfe is most secure <eos> shall finde his state most fickle and unsure <eos>
“ dear mother ida , harken ere i die <eos> he prest the blossom of his lips to mine <eos> and added ‘ this was cast upon the board <eos> when all the full faced presence of the gods <eos> ranged in the halls of peleus ; whereupon <eos> rose feud , with question unto whom ‘ twere due <eos> but light foot iris brought it yester eve <eos> delivering that to me , by common voice <eos> elected umpire , her è comes to day <eos> pallas and aphrodit è, claiming each <eos> this meed of fairest . thou , within the cave <eos> behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine <eos> mayst well behold them unbeheld , unheard <eos> hear all , and see thy paris judge of gods <eos>
then round me , on the light wind softly borne <eos> i heard the numbers of an unseen harp <eos> and turning , saw an angel near me stand <eos> he sang of earthly love , and the soft tones <eos> of his sweet harp were like aeolian strains <eos> far breathing o'er some blissful eden world <eos> and as i listened , all my holiest dreams <eos> of harmony , ideal , grand , and high <eos> seem 'd discord . then methought i saw <eos> upon the morning hills , a bower arise <eos> bright flowers of wondrous hues around it bloomed <eos> all , all of beauty that the heart could dream <eos> was there ; and , lov'lier far than all <eos> a sweet eyed maiden , twining rose wreaths fair <eos>
honora , shou 'd that cruel time arrive <eos> when ‘ gainst my truth thou should'st my errors poize <eos> scorning remembrance of our vanish 'd joys <eos> when for the love warm looks , in which i live <eos> but cold respect must greet me , that shall give <eos> no tender glance , no kind regretful sighs <eos> when thou shalt pass me with averted eyes <eos> feigning thou see'st me not , to sting , and grieve <eos> and sicken my sad heart , i cou 'd not bear <eos> such dire eclipse of thy soul cheering rays <eos> i cou 'd not learn my struggling heart to tear <eos> from thy lov 'd form , that thro ’ my memory strays <eos> nor in the pale horizon of despair <eos> endure the wintry and the darken 'd days <eos>
light of our fathers ’ eyes , and in our own <eos> star of the unsetting sunset ! for thy name <eos> that on the front of noon was as a flame <eos> in the great year nigh thirty years agone <eos> when all the heavens of europe shook and shone <eos> with stormy wind and lightning , keeps its fame <eos> and bears its witness all day through the same <eos> not for past days and great deeds past alone <eos> kossuth , we praise thee as our landor praised <eos> but that now too we know thy voice upraised <eos> thy voice , the trumpet of the truth of god <eos> thine hand , the thunder bearer 's , raised to smite <eos> as with heaven 's lightning for a sword and rod <eos> men 's heads abased before the muscovite <eos>
scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn <eos> and scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade <eos> when cytherea , all in love forlorn <eos> a longing tarriance for adonis made <eos> under an osier growing by a brook <eos> a brook where adon used to cool his spleen <eos> hot was the day ; she hotter that did look <eos> for his approach , that often there had been <eos> anon he comes , and throws his mantle by <eos> and stood stark naked on the brook 's green brim <eos> the sun look 'd on the world with glorious eye <eos> yet not so wistly as this queen on him <eos> he , spying her , bounc 'd in , whereas he stood <eos> o jove , quoth she , why was not i a flood <eos>
at last with ling'ring steps she takes her way <eos> to where great massive rocks like near the bay <eos> upon a rock which seems a resting place <eos> just formed by nature for some tired queen <eos> she half reclines , and upward lifts her face <eos> to drink in all the glory of the scene <eos> low on her cheeks the veiling lashes sweep <eos> that hid the languid fire within her eyes <eos> like shadows fall'n on flowers that softly sleep <eos> beneath night 's falling dews and bending skies <eos> her dark brown hair , with gleams of flitting gold <eos> her queenly head encircles as a crown <eos> a wealth of hair whose careless waves enfold <eos> the quivering sunlight , and its rays chain down <eos>
“ as ever on this side the boiling wave <eos> thou seest diminishing , ” the centaur said <eos> “ so on the other , be thou well assur 'd <eos> it lower still and lower sinks its bed <eos> till in that part it reuniting join <eos> where ‘ t is the lot of tyranny to mourn <eos> there heav'n ' s stern justice lays chastising hand <eos> on attila , who was the scourge of earth <eos> on sextus , and on pyrrhus , and extracts <eos> tears ever by the seething flood unlock 'd <eos> from the rinieri , of corneto this <eos> pazzo the other nam 'd , who fill 'd the ways <eos> with violence and war . ” this said , he turn 'd <eos> and quitting us , alone repass 'd the ford <eos>
trust me , i have not earned your dear rebuke <eos> i love , as you would have me , god the most <eos> would lose not him , but you , must one be lost <eos> nor with lot 's wife cast back a faithless look <eos> unready to forego what i forsook <eos> this say i , having counted up the cost <eos> this , though i be the feeblest of god 's host <eos> the sorriest sheep christ shepherds with his crook <eos> yet while i love my god the most , i deem <eos> that i can never love you overmuch <eos> i love him more , so let me love you too <eos> yea , as i apprehend it , love is such <eos> i cannot love you if i love not him <eos> i cannot love him if i love not you <eos>
such converse held they ; all the space meanwhile <eos> within the trench , between the tow'r and ships <eos> was closely throng 'd with steeds and buckler 'd men <eos> by noble hector , brave as mars , and led <eos> by jove to vict'ry , coop 'd in narrow space <eos> who now had burnt with fire the grecian ships <eos> but juno bade atrides haste to rouse <eos> their fainting courage ; through the camp he pass 'd <eos> on his broad hand a purple robe he bore <eos> and stood upon ulysses ’ lofty ship <eos> the midmost , whence to shout to either side <eos> or to the tents of ajax telamon <eos> or of achilles , who at each extreme <eos> confiding in their strength , had moor 'd their ships <eos>
so spoke the blest immortal ; when more near <eos> his northern wilds in all their breadth appear <eos> lands yet unknown , and streams without a name <eos> rise into vision and demand their fame <eos> as when some saint first gains his bright abode <eos> vaults o'er the spheres and views the works of god <eos> sees earth , his kindred orb , beneath him roll <eos> here glow the centre , and there point the pole <eos> o'er land and sea his eyes delighted rove <eos> and human thoughts his heavenly joys improve <eos> with equal scope the raptured hero 's sight <eos> ranged the low vale , or climb 'd the cloudy height <eos> as , fixt in ardent look , his opening mind <eos> explored the realms that here invite mankind <eos>
were't not for you , here should my pen have rest <eos> and take a long leave of sweet poesy <eos> britannia 's swains , and rivers far by west <eos> should hear no more mine oaten melody <eos> yet shall the song i sung of them awhile <eos> unperfect lie , and make no further known <eos> the happy loves of this our pleasant isle <eos> till i have left some record of mine own <eos> you are the subject now , and , writing you <eos> i well may versify , not poetize <eos> here needs no fiction : for the graces true <eos> and virtues clip not with base flatteries <eos> here could i write what you deserve of praise <eos> others might wear , but i should win the bays <eos>
could i outwear my present state of woe <eos> with one brief winter , and indue i ’ the spring <eos> hues of fresh youth , and mightily outgrow <eos> the wan dark coil of faded suffering <eos> forth in the pride of beauty issuing <eos> a sheeny snake , the light of vernal bowers <eos> moving his crest to all sweet plots of flowers <eos> and watered vallies where the young birds sing <eos> could i thus hope my lost delights renewing <eos> i straightly would commend the tears to creep <eos> from my charged lids ; but inwardly i weep <eos> some vital heat as yet my heart is wooing <eos> this to itself hath drawn the frozen rain <eos> from my cold eyes and melted it again <eos>
there were no heaven but for lovers ’ eyes <eos> save in their depths do all elysiums fade <eos> and gods were dead but for the life that lies <eos> in kisses sweet on sweeter altars laid <eos> there were no heroes did not lovers ride <eos> and pyramid high deeds upon new time <eos> nor tale for feast , or field , or chimney side <eos> and harps were dumb and song had ne'er a rhyme <eos> then live , proud heart , in happy fealty <eos> nor sigh thee more thy dear bonds to remove <eos> thou art not thrall to liege of mean degree <eos> for all are kings who bear the lance of love <eos> no wight so poor but may his tatters lose <eos> and find his purple if his lady choose <eos>
in summers day , when phoebus fairly shone <eos> i saw a bull as white as driven snowe <eos> with gilden homes embowed like the moone <eos> in a fresh flowring meadow lying lowe <eos> up to his eares the verdant grasse did growe <eos> and the gay floures did offer to be eaten <eos> but he with fatnes so did overflows <eos> that he all wallowed in the weedes downe beaten <eos> ne car 'd with them his daintie lips to sweeten <eos> till that a brize *, a scorned little creature <eos> through his faire hide his angrie sting did threaten <eos> and vext so sore , that all his goodly feature <eos> and all his plenteous pasture nought him pleased <eos> so by the small the great is oft diseased <eos>
what seekest thou far in the unknown land <eos> in hope i follow joy gone on before <eos> in hope and fear persistent more and more <eos> as the dry desert lengthens out its sand <eos> whilst day and night i carry in my hand <eos> the golden key to ope the golden door <eos> of golden home ; yet mine eye weepeth sore <eos> for the long journey that must make no stand <eos> and who is this that veiled doth walk with thee <eos> lo , this is love that walketh at my right <eos> one exile holds us both , and we are bound <eos> to selfsame home joys in the land of light <eos> weeping thou walkest with him ; weepeth he <eos> some sobbing weep , some weep and make no sound <eos>
you say that love then led us — you and me <eos> i say ‘ twas hate , that wore love 's wanting eyes <eos> hate that i could not tear away the lies <eos> that wrapped you with their silken sorcery <eos> hate that for you i could not open skies <eos> where beauty lives of her own loveliness <eos> that god would give me no omnipotence <eos> to purge and mould anew your soul 's numb sense <eos> aye , hate that i could love you not tho love <eos> pent in me ached with passion born distress <eos> while thro unfathomable dark the prize <eos> seemed sinking , as my soul , from heaven above <eos> love , say you ? love ? and hate rent us apart <eos> i tell you hate alone so tears the heart <eos>
mysterious night ! when our first parent knew <eos> thee from report divine , and heard thy name <eos> did he not tremble for this lovely frame <eos> this glorious canopy of light and blue <eos> yet ‘ neath a curtain of translucent dew <eos> bathed in the rays of the great setting flame <eos> hesperus with the host of heaven came <eos> and lo ! creation widened in man 's view <eos> who could have thought such darkness lay concealed <eos> within thy beams , o sun ! or who could find <eos> whilst flow'r and leaf and insect stood revealed <eos> that to such countless orbs thou mad'st us blind <eos> why do we , then , shun death with anxious strife <eos> if light can thus deceive , wherefore not life <eos>
and therefore if to love can be desert <eos> i am not all unworthy . cheeks as pale <eos> as these you see , and trembling knees that fail <eos> to bear the burden of a heavy heart <eos> this weary minstrel life that once was girt <eos> to climb aornus , and can scarce avail <eos> to pipe now ‘ gainst the valley nightingale <eos> a melancholy music ,— why advert <eos> to these things ? o beloved , it is plain <eos> i am not of thy worth nor for thy place <eos> and yet , because i love thee , i obtain <eos> from that same love this vindicating grace <eos> to live on still in love , and yet in vain <eos> to bless thee , yet renounce thee to thy face <eos>
when i do think my meanest line shall be <eos> more in time ’ s use than my creating whole <eos> that future eyes more clearly shall feel me <eos> in this inked page than in my direct soul <eos> when i conjecture put to make me seeing <eos> good readers of me in some aftertime <eos> thankful to some idea of my being <eos> that doth not even my with gone true soul rime <eos> an anger at the essence of the world <eos> that makes this thus , or thinkable this wise <eos> takes my soul by the throat and makes it hurled <eos> in nightly horrors of despaired surmise <eos> and i become the mere sense of a rage <eos> that lacks the very words whose waste might ’ suage <eos>
if ever sorrow spoke from soul that loves <eos> as speaks a spirit in a man possest <eos> in me her spirit speaks . my soul it moves <eos> whose sigh swoll'n words breed whirlwinds in my breast <eos> or like the echo of a passing bell <eos> which sounding on the water seems to howl <eos> so rings my heart a fearful heavy knell <eos> and keeps all night in consort with the owl <eos> my cheeks with a thin ice of tears are clad <eos> mine eyes like morning stars are bleared and red <eos> what resteth then but i be raging mad <eos> to see that she , my cares ’ chief conduit head <eos> when all streams else help quench my burning heart <eos> shuts up her springs and will no grace impart <eos>
beauty and love let no one separate <eos> whom exact nature did to each other fit <eos> giving to beauty love as finishing fate <eos> and to love beauty as true colour of it <eos> let he but friend be who the soul finds fair <eos> but let none love outside the body ’ s thought <eos> so the seen couple ’ s togetherness shall bear <eos> truth to the beauty each in the other sought <eos> i could but love thee out of mockery <eos> of love and thee and mine own ugliness <eos> therefore thy beauty i sing and wish not thee <eos> thanking the gods i long not out of place <eos> lest , like a slave that for kings ’ robes doth long <eos> obtained , shall with mere wearing do them wrong <eos>
the beach was crowded . pausing now and then <eos> he groped and fiddled doggedly along <eos> his worn face glaring on the thoughtless throng <eos> the stony peevishness of sightless men <eos> he seemed scarce older than his clothes . again <eos> grotesquing thinly many an old sweet song <eos> so cracked his fiddle , his hand so frail and wrong <eos> you hardly could distinguish one in ten <eos> he stopped at last , and sat him on the sand <eos> and , grasping wearily his bread winner <eos> stared dim towards the blue immensity <eos> then leaned his head upon his poor old hand <eos> he may have slept : he did not speak nor stir <eos> his gesture spoke a vast despondency <eos>
i know myself . not servile for applause <eos> my muse permits no deprecating clause <eos> modest or vain , she will not be denied <eos> one bold confession due to honest pride <eos> and well she knows the drooping veil of song <eos> shall save her boldness from the caviller 's wrong <eos> her sweeter voice the heavenly maid imparts <eos> to tell the secrets of our aching hearts <eos> for this , a suppliant , captive , prostrate , bound <eos> she kneels imploring at the feet of sound <eos> for this , convulsed in thought 's maternal pains <eos> she loads her arms with rhyme 's resounding chains <eos> faint though the music of her fetters be <eos> it lends one charm ,— her lips are ever free <eos>

if laura — lady of the flower soft face <eos> should light upon these verses , she may take <eos> the tenderest line , and through its pulses trace <eos> what man can suffer for a woman 's sake <eos> for in the nights that burn , the days that break <eos> a thin pale figure stands in passion 's place <eos> and peace comes not , nor yet the perished grace <eos> of youth , to keep old faiths and fires awake <eos> ah ! marvellous maid . life sobs , and sighing saith <eos> “ she left me , fleeting like a fluttered dove <eos> but i would have a moment of her breath <eos> so i might taste the sweetest sense thereof <eos> and catch from blossoming , honeyed lips of love <eos> some faint , some fair , some dim , delicious death <eos>

if e'er again return those awful days <eos> whose clouds were crimsoned with the beacon 's blaze <eos> whose grass was trampled by the soldier 's heel <eos> whose tides were reddened round the rushing keel <eos> god grant some lyre may wake a nobler strain <eos> to rend the silence of our tented plain <eos> when gallia 's flag its triple fold displays <eos> her marshalled legions peal the marseillaise <eos> when round the german close the war clouds dim <eos> far through their shadows floats his battle hymn <eos> when , crowned with joy , the camps ’ of england ring <eos> a thousand voices shout , “ god save the king <eos> when victory follows with our eagle 's glance <eos> our nation 's anthem pipes a country dance <eos>
if e'er the sacred poem that hath made <eos> both heav'n and earth copartners in its toil <eos> and with lean abstinence , through many a year <eos> faded my brow , be destin 'd to prevail <eos> over the cruelty , which bars me forth <eos> of the fair sheep fold , where a sleeping lamb <eos> the wolves set on and fain had worried me <eos> with other voice and fleece of other grain <eos> i shall forthwith return , and , standing up <eos> at my baptismal font , shall claim the wreath <eos> due to the poet 's temples : for i there <eos> first enter 'd on the faith which maketh souls <eos> acceptable to god : and , for its sake <eos> peter had then circled my forehead thus <eos>

yet more , when fair lavinia fed the fire <eos> before the gods , and stood beside her sire <eos> ( strange to relate !) the flames , involv 'd in smoke <eos> of incense , from the sacred altar broke <eos> caught her dishevel 'd hair and rich attire <eos> her crown and jewels crackled in the fire <eos> from thence the fuming trail began to spread <eos> and lambent glories danc 'd about her head <eos> this new portent the seer with wonder views <eos> then pausing , thus his prophecy renews <eos> “ the nymph , who scatters flaming fires around <eos> shall shine with honor , shall herself be crown 'd <eos> but , caus 'd by her irrevocable fate <eos> war shall the country waste , and change the state <eos>
this band dismiss 'd , behold , another crowd <eos> preferr 'd the same request , and lowly bow 'd <eos> the constant tenor of whose well spent days <eos> no less deserved a just return of praise <eos> but straight the direful trump of slander sounds <eos> through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds <eos> loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies <eos> the dire report through every region flies <eos> in every ear incessant rumours rung <eos> and gathering scandals grew on every tongue <eos> from the black trumpet 's rusty concave broke <eos> sulphureous flames , and clouds of rolling smoke <eos> the poisonous vapour blots the purple skies <eos> and withers all before it as it flies <eos>

my own beloved , who hast lifted me <eos> from this drear flat of earth where i was thrown <eos> and , in betwixt the languid ringlets , blown <eos> a life breath , till the forehead hopefully <eos> shines out again , as all the angels see <eos> before thy saving kiss ! my own , my own <eos> who camest to me when the world was gone <eos> and i who looked for only god , found thee <eos> i find thee ; i am safe , and strong , and glad <eos> as one who stands in dewless asphodel <eos> looks backward on the tedious time he had <eos> in the upper life ,— so i , with bosom swell <eos> make witness , here , between the good and bad <eos> that love , as strong as death , retrieves as well <eos>

thus live undying through the lapse of time <eos> the solemn legends of the warrior 's clime <eos> like egypt 's pyramid or paestum 's fane <eos> they stand the heralds of the voiceless plain <eos> yet not like them , for time , by slow degrees <eos> saps the gray stone and wears the embroidered frieze <eos> and isis sleeps beneath her subject nile <eos> and crumbled neptune strews his dorian pile <eos> but art 's fair fabric , strengthening as it rears <eos> its laurelled columns through the mist of years <eos> as the blue arches of the bending skies <eos> still gird the torrent , following as it flies <eos> spreads , with the surges bearing on mankind <eos> its starred pavilion o'er the tides of mind <eos>

my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming <eos> i love not less , though less the show appear <eos> that love is merchandized , whose rich esteeming <eos> the owner 's tongue doth publish every where <eos> our love was new , and then but in the spring <eos> when i was wont to greet it with my lays <eos> as philomel in summer 's front doth sing <eos> and stops her pipe in growth of riper days <eos> not that the summer is less pleasant now <eos> than when her mournful hymns did hush the night <eos> but that wild music burthens every bough <eos> and sweets grown common lose their dear delight <eos> therefore like her , i sometime hold my tongue <eos> because i would not dull you with my song <eos>

to whom the swain : “ i hear and i obey <eos> but old laertes weeps his life away <eos> and deems thee lost : shall i speed employ <eos> to bless his age : a messenger of joy <eos> the mournful hour that tore his son away <eos> sent the sad sire in solitude to stray <eos> yet busied with his slaves , to ease his woe <eos> he dress 'd the vine , and bade the garden blow <eos> nor food nor wine refused ; but since the day <eos> that you to pylos plough 'd the watery way <eos> nor wine nor food he tastes ; but , sunk in woes <eos> wild springs the vine , no more the garden blows <eos> shut from the walks of men , to pleasure lost <eos> pensive and pale he wanders half a ghost <eos>
and yet , because thou overcomest so <eos> because thou art more noble and like a king <eos> thou canst prevail against my fears and fling <eos> thy purple round me , till my heart shall grow <eos> too close against thine heart henceforth to know <eos> how it shook when alone . why , conquering <eos> may prove as lordly and complete a thing <eos> in lifting upward , as in crushing low <eos> and as a vanquished soldier yields his sword <eos> to one who lifts him from the bloody earth <eos> even so , beloved , i at last record <eos> here ends my strife . if thou invite me forth <eos> i rise above abasement at the word <eos> make thy love larger to enlarge my worth <eos>
let not the scornful ask me what avails <eos> so small a pack to follow mighty trails <eos> long since i saw what difference must be <eos> between a stream like you , a ditch like me <eos> this drains a garden and a homely field <eos> which scarce at times a living current yield <eos> the other from the high lands of his birth <eos> plunges through rocks and spurns the pastoral earth <eos> then settling silent to his deeper course <eos> draws in his fellows to augment his force <eos> becomes a name , and broadening as he goes <eos> gives power and purity where'er he flows <eos> till , great enough for any commerce grown <eos> he links all nations while he serves his own <eos>
muse of the many twinkling feet ! whose charms <eos> are now extended up from legs to arms <eos> terpsichore !— too long misdeem 'd a maid <eos> reproachful term — bestow 'd but to upbraid <eos> henceforth in all the bronze of brightness shine <eos> the least a vestal of the virgin nine <eos> far be from thee and thine the name of prude <eos> mock 'd , yet triumphant ; sneer 'd at , unsubdued <eos> thy legs must move to conquer as they fly <eos> if but thy coats are reasonably high <eos> thy breast , if bare enough , requires no shield <eos> dance forth — sans armour thou shalt take the field <eos> and own — impregnable to most assaults <eos> thy not too lawfully begotten “ waltz <eos>
when winter snows upon thy sable hairs <eos> and frost of age hath nipped thy beauties near <eos> when dark shall seem thy day that never clears <eos> and all lies withered that was held so dear <eos> then take this picture which i here present thee <eos> limned with a pencil not all unworthy <eos> here see the gifts that god and nature lent thee <eos> here read thyself and what i suffered for thee <eos> this may remain thy lasting monument <eos> which happily posterity may cherish <eos> these colours with thy fading are not spent <eos> these may remain when thou and i shall perish <eos> if they remain , then thou shalt live thereby <eos> they will remain , and so thou canst not die <eos>
sweet bird , that sing'st away the early hours <eos> of winters past or coming , void of care <eos> well pleased with delights which present are <eos> fair seasons , budding sprays , sweet smelling flowers <eos> to rocks , to springs , to rills , from leafy bowers <eos> thou thy creator 's goodness dost declare <eos> and what dear gifts on thee he did not spare <eos> a stain to human sense in sin that lowers <eos> what soul can be so sick , which by thy songs <eos> attired in sweetness , sweetly is not driven <eos> quite to forget earth 's turmoils , spites , and wrongs <eos> and lift a reverend eye and thought to heaven <eos> sweet artless songster , thou my mind dost raise <eos> to airs of spheres , yes , and to angels ’ lays <eos>
“ the barley harvest was nodding white <eos> when my children died on the rocky height <eos> and the reapers were singing on hill and plain <eos> when i came to my task of sorrow and pain <eos> but now the season of rain is nigh <eos> the sun is dim in the thickening sky <eos> and the clouds in sullen darkness rest <eos> where he hides his light at the doors of the west <eos> i hear the howl of the wind that brings <eos> the long drear storm on its heavy wings <eos> but the howling wind and the driving rain <eos> will beat on my houseless head in vain <eos> i shall stay , from my murdered sons to scare <eos> the beasts of the desert , and fowls of air <eos>
when i consider how my light is spent <eos> ere half my days , in this dark world and wide <eos> and that one talent , which is death to hide <eos> lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent <eos> to serve therewith my maker , and present <eos> my true account , lest he , returning , chide <eos> ‘ doth god exact day labour , light denied <eos> i fondly ask . but patience , to prevent <eos> that murmur , soon replies : ‘ god doth not need <eos> either man 's work or his own gifts . who best <eos> bear his mild yoke , they serve him best . his state <eos> is kingly . thousands , at his bidding , speed <eos> and post o'er land and ocean , without rest <eos> they also serve who only stand and wait <eos>

o goodness in horror ! o ill not all ill <eos> in the worst of the worst may be fierce hope still <eos> to morrow with dawn will come many a wain <eos> and bear away loads of human pain <eos> piles of pale beds for the ‘ spitals ; but some <eos> again will awake in home mornings , and some <eos> dull herds of the war , again follow the drum <eos> from others , faint blood shall in families flow <eos> with wonder at life , and young oldness in woe <eos> yet hence may the movers of great earth grow <eos> now , even now , i hear them at hand <eos> though again captain sword is up in the land <eos> marching anew for more fields like these <eos> in the health of his flag in the morning breeze <eos>
and how fare you ? if you deserve in truth <eos> the name men give you , you 're a happy youth <eos> rome 's thousand tongues , agreed at least in this <eos> ascribe to you a plenitude of bliss <eos> yet , when you judge of self , i fear you 're prone <eos> to take another 's word before your own <eos> to think of happiness as ‘ twere a prize <eos> that men may win though neither good nor wise <eos> just so the glutton whom the world thinks well <eos> keeps dark his fever till the dinner bell <eos> then , as he 's eating , with his hands well greased <eos> shivering comes on , and proves the fool diseased <eos> o , ‘ tis a false , false shame that would conceal <eos> from doctors ’ eyes the sores it cannot heal <eos>
but first , by reason let me prove , i pray <eos> that evil such as this , and which you say <eos> oft weighs you down with soul corroding care <eos> is only in the mind :— mere spright of air <eos> your hat upon your head for instance place <eos> less gently rather than 's your usual case <eos> pray , do n't it presently at ease remain <eos> and from it do you aught amiss retain <eos> not e'en a spot ; there 's nothing half so clear <eos> the features , too , they as before appear <eos> no difference assuredly you see <eos> then how can cuckoldom an evil be <eos> such my conclusion , spite of fools or brutes <eos> with whose ideas reason never suits <eos>

i have dreamed of death :— what will it be to die <eos> not in a dream , but in the literal truth <eos> with all death 's adjuncts ghastly and uncouth <eos> the pang that is the last and the last sigh <eos> too dulled , it may be , for a last good bye <eos> too comfortless for any one to soothe <eos> a helpless charmless spectacle of ruth <eos> through long last hours , so long while yet they fly <eos> so long to those who hopeless in their fear <eos> watch the slow breath and look for what they dread <eos> while i supine , with ears that cease to hear <eos> with eyes that glaze , with heart pulse running down <eos> ( alas ! no saint rejoicing on her bed <eos> may miss the goal at last , may miss a crown <eos>
sweet song flower of the mayspring of our song <eos> be welcome to us , with loving thanks and praise <eos> to his good hand who travelling on strange ways <eos> found thee forlorn and fragrant , lain along <eos> beneath dead leaves that many a winter 's wrong <eos> had rained and heaped through nigh three centuries ’ maze <eos> above thy maybloom , hiding from our gaze <eos> the life that in thy leaves lay sweet and strong <eos> for thine have life , while many above thine head <eos> piled by the wind lie blossomless and dead <eos> so now disburdened of such load above <eos> that lay as death 's own dust upon thee shed <eos> by days too deaf to hear thee like a dove <eos> murmuring , we hear thee , bird and flower of love <eos>

but you who take the city for your own <eos> come with me when the night flows deep and kind <eos> along these narrow ways of troubled stone <eos> and floods the wide savannas of the mind <eos> with tides that cool the fever of the day <eos> one with the dark , companioned by the stars <eos> we 'll seek st. philip 's , nebulous and gray <eos> holding its throbbing beacon to the bars <eos> a prisoned spirit vibrant in the stone <eos> that knew its empire of forgotten things <eos> then will the city know you for her own <eos> and feel you meet to share her sufferings <eos> while down a swirl of poignant memories <eos> herself shall find you in her silences <eos>

how should i sing when buffeting salt waves <eos> and stung with bitter surges , in whose might <eos> i toss , a cockleshell ? the dreadful night <eos> marshals its undefeated dark and raves <eos> in brutal madness , reeling over graves <eos> of vanquished men , long sunken out of sight <eos> sent wailing down to glut the ghoulish sprite <eos> who haunts foul seaweed forests and their caves <eos> no parting cloud reveals a watery star <eos> my cries are washed away upon the wind <eos> my cramped and blistering hands can find no spar <eos> my eyes with hope o'erstrained , are growing blind <eos> but painted on the sky great visions burn <eos> my voice , oblation from a shattered urn <eos>

my hope and heart is with thee — thou wilt be <eos> a latter luther , and a soldier priest <eos> to scare church harpies from the master 's feast <eos> our dusted velvets have much need of thee <eos> thou art no sabbath drawler of old saws <eos> distill 'd from some worm canker 'd homily <eos> but spurr 'd at heart with fieriest energy <eos> to embattail and to wall about thy cause <eos> with iron worded proof , hating to hark <eos> the humming of the drowsy pulpit drone <eos> half god 's good sabbath , while the worn out clerk <eos> brow beats his desk below . thou from a throne <eos> mounted in heaven wilt shoot into the dark <eos> arrows of lightnings . i will stand and mark <eos>

oft let me range the gloomy aisles alone <eos> sad luxury ! to vulgar minds unknown <eos> along the walls where speaking marbles show <eos> what worthies form the hallowed mould belew <eos> proud names , who once the reins of empire held <eos> in arms who triumphed , or in arts excelled <eos> chiefs , graced with scars , and prodigal of blood <eos> stern patriots , who for sacred freedom stood <eos> just men , by whom impartial laws were given <eos> and saints , who taught and led the way to heaven <eos> ne'er to these chambers , where the mighty rest <eos> since their foundation came a nobler guest <eos> nor e'er was to the bowers of bliss conveyed <eos> a fairer spirit or more welcome shade <eos>
into a stately dwelling dark and old <eos> a woman glides with troubled , weary air <eos> her face is pale , her hands are white and cold <eos> the silken hood falls from her loosened hair <eos> she heeds it not , but listlessly stands <eos> with thoughtful eyes and tightly folded hands <eos> at last the maid with noiseless step draws near <eos> removes her wraps and in her listening ear <eos> speaks these few words : “ in passing through the crowd <eos> to night , a man of face and manner proud <eos> this missive gave to me . i looked around <eos> for one brief moment his face upon me frowned <eos> then he was gone , and though i scanned the street <eos> his form again my glances did not meet <eos>
sir alex .— what would you have ? what is it that you wish <eos> would ye , for food , sweet friends , become all slaves <eos> and for a meal , that ye might surfeit on it <eos> give up your wives , your homes , and all that 's dear <eos> to the brute arms of men , who hold it virtue <eos> to heap their shame upon a fallen foe <eos> would ye , that ye might eat , yet not be satisfied <eos> pick up the scanty crumbs around their camp <eos> after their cattle and their dogs have left them <eos> or would ye , for this favour , be content <eos> to take up arms against your countrymen <eos> for this ! will fathers fight against their sons <eos> sons ‘ gainst their fathers ?— brethren with each other <eos> those who would wish it may go o'er to edward <eos>

the midnight is not more bewildering <eos> to her drowsed eyes , than to her ears , the sound <eos> of dim , sweet singing voices , interwound <eos> with purl of flute and subtle twang of string <eos> strained through the lattice , where the roses cling <eos> and , with their fragrance , waft the notes around <eos> her haunted senses . thirsting beyond bound <eos> of her slow yielding dreams , the lilt and swing <eos> of the mysterious delirious tune <eos> she drains like some strange opiate , with awed eyes <eos> upraised against her casement , where aswoon <eos> the stars fail from her sight , and up the skies <eos> of alien azure rolls the full round moon <eos> like some vast bubble blown of summer noon <eos>

of all the causes which conspire to blind <eos> man 's erring judgment and misguide the mind <eos> what the weak head with strongest bias rules <eos> is pride , the never failing vice of fools <eos> whatever nature has in worth denied <eos> she gives in large recruits of needful pride <eos> for as in bodies , thus in souls , we find <eos> what wants in blood and spirits , swelled with wind <eos> pride where wit fails steps in to our defense <eos> and fills up all the mighty void of sense <eos> if once right reason drives that cloud away <eos> truth breaks upon us with resistless day <eos> trust not yourself , but your defects to know <eos> make use of every friend — and every foe <eos>

yet may we not entirely overlook <eos> the pleasure gathered from the rudiments <eos> of geometric science . though advanced <eos> in these inquiries , with regret i speak <eos> no farther than the threshold , [ g ] there i found <eos> both elevation and composed delight <eos> with indian awe and wonder , ignorance pleased <eos> with its own struggles , did i meditate <eos> on the relation those abstractions bear <eos> to nature 's laws , and by what process led <eos> those immaterial agents bowed their heads <eos> duly to serve the mind of earth born man <eos> from star to star , from kindred sphere to sphere <eos> from system on to system without end <eos>
could'st thou resign the park and play , content <eos> for the fair banks of severn or of trent <eos> there might'st thou find some elegant retreat <eos> some hireling senator 's deserted seat <eos> and stretch thy prospects o'er the smiling land <eos> for less than rent the dungeons of the strand <eos> there prune thy walks , support thy drooping flowers <eos> direct thy rivulets , and twine thy bowers <eos> and , while thy grounds a cheap repast afford <eos> despise the dainties of a venal lord <eos> there every bush with nature 's music rings <eos> there every breeze bears health upon its wings <eos> on all thy hours security shall smile <eos> and bless thine evening walk and morning toil <eos>

and gawayne rubbed his arms , his chest he beat <eos> then grasped the battle axe and braced his feet <eos> and swung the ponderous weapon high in air <eos> and brought it down like lightning , fair and square <eos> upon the stranger 's neck . the axe flashed through <eos> cutting the green knight cleanly right in two <eos> and split the hard stone floor like kindling wood <eos> the head dropped off ; out gushed the thick , hot blood <eos> like — i can n't find the simile i want <eos> but let us say a flood of cr ê me de menthe <eos> and then the warriors standing round about <eos> sent up from fifty throats a mighty shout <eos> as when o'er bloodhyppphensprent fields the long cheers roll <eos> cacophonous , for him who kicks a goal <eos>
few words they said ; the balmy odorous wind <eos> wandered about , some resting place to find <eos> the young leaves rustled ‘ neath its gentle breath <eos> and here and there some blossom burst his sheath <eos> adding unnoticed fragrance to the night <eos> but , as they pondered , a new golden light <eos> streamed over the green garden , and they heard <eos> sweet voices sing some ancient poet 's word <eos> in praise of may , and then in sight there came <eos> the minstrels ’ figures underneath the flame <eos> of scented torches passing ‘ twixt the trees <eos> and soon the dusky hall grew bright with these <eos> and therewithal they put all thought away <eos> and midst the tinkling harps drank deep to may <eos>
what right to freedom when we are not free <eos> when all the passions goad us into lust <eos> when , for the worthless spoil we lick the dust <eos> and while one half our people die , that we <eos> may sit with peace and freedom ‘ neath our tree <eos> the other gloats for plunder and for spoil <eos> bustles through daylight , vexes night with toil <eos> cheats , swindles , lies and steals !— shall such things be <eos> endowed with such grand boons as liberty <eos> brings in her train of blessings ? should we pray <eos> that such as these should still maintain the sway <eos> these soulless , senseless , heartless enemies <eos> of all that 's good and great , of all that 's wise <eos> worthy on earth , or in the eternal eyes <eos>
how blest is he who knows no meaner strife <eos> than art 's long battle with the foes of life <eos> no doubt assails him , doing still his best <eos> and trusting kindly nature for the rest <eos> no mocking conscience tears the thin disguise <eos> that wraps his breast , and tells him that he lies <eos> he comes : the languid sufferer lifts his head <eos> and smiles a welcome from his weary bed <eos> he speaks : what music like the tones that tell <eos> “ past is the hour of danger ,— all is well <eos> how can he feel the petty stings of grief <eos> whose cheering presence always brings relief <eos> what ugly dreams can trouble his repose <eos> who yields himself to soothe another 's woes <eos>

and now with transport wild ernestus spies <eos> dalarne 's continuous coast before him rise <eos> ere yet he reach 'd the bank , the toiling oar <eos> he dropp 'd , and sprung impatient to the shore <eos> before him wide the dark brow 'd forests frown 'd <eos> and morn 's still hour hush 'd all the space around <eos> save where the whispers of the changeful breeze <eos> half waved the summits of the towering trees <eos> alone , and guided by a straggling beam <eos> he hastened onward , where the murmuring stream <eos> cut thro ’ the woods its liquid way , and laved <eos> the grass , that round their trunks luxuriant waved <eos> the willing woods an easy passage yield <eos> and his glad footsteps reach the bordering field <eos>
the world was in its day of peril dark <eos> wont to believe the dotage of fond love <eos> from the fair cyprian deity , who rolls <eos> in her third epicycle , shed on men <eos> by stream of potent radiance : therefore they <eos> of elder time , in their old error blind <eos> not her alone with sacrifice ador 'd <eos> and invocation , but like honours paid <eos> to cupid and dione , deem 'd of them <eos> her mother , and her son , him whom they feign 'd <eos> to sit in dido 's bosom : and from her <eos> whom i have sung preluding , borrow 'd they <eos> the appellation of that star , which views <eos> now obvious and now averse , the sun <eos>
i have done i know not what ,— what have i done <eos> my brother 's blood , my brother 's soul , doth cry <eos> and i find no defence , find no reply <eos> no courage more to run this race i run <eos> not knowing what i have done , have left undone <eos> ah me , these awful unknown hours that fly <eos> fruitless it may be , fleeting fruitless by <eos> rank with death savor underneath the sun <eos> for what avails it that i did not know <eos> the deed i did ? what profits me the plea <eos> that had i known i had not wronged him so <eos> lord jesus christ , my god , him pity thou <eos> lord , if it may be , pity also me <eos> in judgment pity , and in death , and now <eos>
o happy thames , that didst my stella bear <eos> i saw thee with full many a smiling line <eos> upon thy cheerful face joy 's livery wear <eos> while those fair planets on thy streams did shine <eos> the boat for joy could not to dance forbear <eos> while wanton winds , with beauties so divine <eos> ravish 'd , stay 'd not , till in her golden hair <eos> they did themselves ( o sweetest prison !) twine <eos> and fain those oeol 's youth there would their stay <eos> have made ; but , forced by nature still to fly <eos> first did with puffing kiss those locks display <eos> she , so dishevell 'd , blush 'd . from window i <eos> with sight thereof , cried out , ‘ o fair disgrace <eos> let honour 's self to thee grant highest place <eos>
in token of the love which thou hast shown <eos> for this wide land of freedom , i have named <eos> a province vast , and for its beauty famed <eos> by thy dear name to be hereafter known <eos> alberta shall it be ! her fountains thrown <eos> from alps unto three oceans , to all men <eos> shall vaunt her loveliness e'en now ; and when <eos> each little hamlet to a city grown <eos> and numberless as blades of prairie grass <eos> or the thick leaves in distant forest bower <eos> great peoples hear the giant currents pass <eos> still shall the waters , bringing wealth and power <eos> speak the loved name ,— the land of silver springs <eos> worthy the daughter of our english kings <eos>
as draws the golden meteor of the day <eos> exhaled matter from the ground to heaven <eos> and by his secret nature , there to stay <eos> the thing fast held , and yet of hold bereaven <eos> so by th ’ attractive excellence and might <eos> born to the power of thy transparent eyes <eos> drawn from myself , ravished with thy delight <eos> whose dumb conceits divinely sirenise <eos> lo , in suspense of fear and hope upholden <eos> diversely poised with passions that pain me <eos> no resolution dares my thoughts embolden <eos> since ‘ tis not i , but thou that dost sustain me <eos> o if there 's none but thou can work my woe <eos> wilt thou be still unkind and kill me so <eos>
indeed this very love which is my boast <eos> and which , when rising up from breast to brow <eos> doth crown me with a ruby large enow <eos> to draw men 's eyes and prove the inner cost <eos> this love even , all my worth , to the uttermost <eos> i should not love withal , unless that thou <eos> hadst set me an example , shown me how <eos> when first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed <eos> and love called love . and thus , i cannot speak <eos> of love even , as a good thing of my own <eos> thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak <eos> and placed it by thee on a golden throne <eos> and that i love ( o soul , we must be meek <eos> is by thee only , whom i love alone <eos>
you ask me for a sonnet . ah , my dear <eos> can clocks tick back to yesterday at noon <eos> can cracked and fallen leaves recall last june <eos> and leap up on the boughs , now stiff and sere <eos> for your sake , i would go and seek the year <eos> faded beyond the purple ranks of dune <eos> blown sands of drifted hours , which the moon <eos> streaks with a ghostly finger , and her sneer <eos> pulls at my lengthening shadow . yes , ‘ tis that <eos> my shadow stretches forward , and the ground <eos> is dark in front because the light 's behind <eos> it is grotesque , with such a funny hat <eos> in watching it and walking i have found <eos> more than enough to occupy my mind <eos>
in secret they , the pleasing task pursue <eos> but soon — ( what can escape a lovers view <eos> soon dido saw the change , her boding mind <eos> 365 fancied , foresaw , or felt what they desgn 'd <eos> trembling , alive to all she sees or hears <eos> suspecting ev'ry thing , she doubts , she fears <eos> while fame that wounded feeling never spar 'd <eos> the crews on board announced , the fleet prepar 'd <eos> 379 till mad'ning flames within her bosom rise <eos> distracted , furious , o'er the town she flies <eos> wild as the woodnymph when the frantic rite <eos> and bacchanalian shout , to rage excite <eos> madder and louder as the god invades <eos> 375 she hears him bounding thro ’ the midnight shades <eos>
some hold it strange that love like thine and mine <eos> ‘ twixt two in state so sunder 'd should be bred <eos> that he who did all worths in him combine <eos> birth , beauty , wit , wealth , me thus honour è d <eos> me , the poor motley , maim 'd by fortune 's spite <eos> sear 'd and o'erworn with tyranny of time <eos> whose wit was but the wit to learn to write <eos> when thou , my muse , inspir'dst my pupil rhyme <eos> thou wert the wide world 's pride , but i his scorn <eos> his pattern thou , i his poor toy and tool <eos> whence therefore should that tender love be born <eos> ‘ twixt fortune 's minion thee , and me her fool <eos> o know they not that all such outward things <eos> hold lowest count in the soul 's reckonings <eos>
then spake the lad : “ and once i saw a host <eos> of men pass by the borders of the wood <eos> a glitter in the sun , and riding fast <eos> on splendid creatures , prancing as they went <eos> oh , i would fain have been like these fair men <eos> but , laughing gaily , on they galloped fast <eos> and i ran after them to be like them <eos> and join the glittering host and see the world <eos> but though i ran , they faded from my sight <eos> yet have i followed , over hill and dale <eos> day after day i follow on their track <eos> and here i am as now you see me here <eos> my bow has done me service on the way <eos> against wild beasts and savage seeming men <eos>
o steep and rugged life , whose harsh ascent <eos> slopes blindly upward through the bitter night <eos> they say that on thy summit , high in light <eos> sweet rest awaits the climber , travel spent <eos> but i , alas , with dusty garments rent <eos> with fainting heart and failing limbs and sight <eos> can see no glimmer of the shining height <eos> and vainly list , with body forward bent <eos> to catch athwart the gloom one wandering note <eos> of those glad anthems which ( they say ) are sung <eos> when one emerges from the mists below <eos> but though , o life , thy summit be remote <eos> and all thy stony path with darkness hung <eos> yet ever upward through the night i go <eos>
he finish 'd ; and , one soul inspiring all <eos> form 'd in a wedge , the foot approach the wall <eos> without the town , an unprovided train <eos> of gaping , gazing citizens are slain <eos> some firebrands , others scaling ladders bear <eos> and those they toss aloft , and these they rear <eos> the flames now launch 'd , the feather 'd arrows fly <eos> and clouds of missive arms obscure the sky <eos> advancing to the front , the hero stands <eos> and , stretching out to heav'n his pious hands <eos> attests the gods , asserts his innocence <eos> upbraids with breach of faith th ’ ausonian prince <eos> declares the royal honor doubly stain 'd <eos> and twice the rites of holy peace profan 'd <eos>
her courts are by the flux of flaming ways <eos> between the rivers and the illumined sky <eos> whose fervid depths reverberate from on high <eos> fierce lustres mingled in a fiery haze <eos> they mark it inland ; blithe and fair of face <eos> her suitors follow , guessing by the glare <eos> beyond the hilltops in the evening air <eos> how bright the cressets at her portals blaze <eos> on the pure fronts defeat ere many a day <eos> falls like the soot and dirt on city snow <eos> there hopes deferred lie sunk in piteous seams <eos> her paths are disillusion and decay <eos> with ruins piled and unapparent woe <eos> the graves of beauty and the wreck of dreams <eos>
i could not find the little maid content <eos> so out i rushed , and sought her far and wide <eos> but not where pleasure each new fancy tried <eos> heading the maze of rioting merriment <eos> nor where , with restless eyes and bow half bent <eos> love in the brake of sweetbriar smiled and sighed <eos> nor yet where fame towered , crowned and glorified <eos> found i her face , nor wheresoe'er i went <eos> so homeward back i crawled , like wounded bird <eos> when lo ! content sate spinning at my door <eos> and when i asked her where she was before <eos> “ here all the time , ” she said ; “ i never stirred <eos> too eager in thy search , you passed me o'er <eos> and , though i called you , neither saw nor heard <eos>
ah ! colin , whether on the lowly plaine <eos> piping to shepheards thy sweet roundelayes <eos> or whether singing , in some loftie vaine <eos> heroicke deeds of past or present dayes <eos> or whether in thy lovely mistresse praise <eos> thou list to exercise thy learned quill <eos> thy muse hath got such grace and power to please <eos> with rare invention , beautified by skill <eos> as who therin can ever ioy their fill <eos> o , therefore let that happy muse proceed <eos> to clime the height of vertues sacred hill <eos> where endlesse honour shal be made thy meed <eos> because no malice of succeeding dales <eos> can rase those records of thy lasting praise <eos>
were i as base as is the lowly plain <eos> and you , my love , as high as heaven above <eos> yet should the thoughts of me , your humble swain <eos> ascend to heaven in honor of my love <eos> were i as high as heaven above the plain <eos> and you , my love , as humble and as low <eos> as are the deepest bottoms of the main <eos> wheresoe'er you were , with you my love should go <eos> were you the earth , dear love , and i the skies <eos> my love should shine on you , like to the sun <eos> and look upon you with ten thousand eyes <eos> till heaven waxed blind and till the world were done <eos> wheresoe'er i am ,— below , or else above you <eos> wheresoe'er you are , my heart shall truly love you <eos>
whoever thinks a faultless piece to see <eos> thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be <eos> in every work regard the writer 's end <eos> since none can compass more than they intend <eos> and if the means be just , the conduct true <eos> applause , in spite of trivial faults , is due <eos> as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit <eos> to avoid great errors , must the less commit <eos> neglect the rules each verbal critic lays <eos> for not to know some trifles is a praise <eos> most critics , fond of some subservient art <eos> still make the whole depend upon a part <eos> they talk of principles , but notions prize <eos> and all to one loved folly sacrifice <eos>
the teian muse invites thee from above <eos> to lay thy trumpet down , and sing of love <eos> let montague describe boyn 's swelling flood <eos> and purple streams fatned with hostile blood <eos> o heavenly patron of the needy muse <eos> whose powerful name can nobler heat infuse <eos> when you nassau 's bright actions dar 'd to see <eos> you was the eagle , and apollo he <eos> but when he read you , and your value knew <eos> he was the eagle , and apollo you <eos> both spoke the bird in her æ thereal height <eos> the majesty was his , and thine the flight <eos> both did apollo in his glory shew <eos> the silver harp was thine , and his the bow <eos>
one that is ever kind said yesterday <eos> “ your well beloved 's hair has threads of grey <eos> and little shadows come about her eyes <eos> time can but make it easier to be wise <eos> though now it 's hard , till trouble is at an end <eos> and so be patient , be wise and patient , friend <eos> but , heart , there is no comfort , not a grain <eos> time can but make her beauty over again <eos> because of that great nobleness of hers <eos> the fire that stirs about her , when she stirs <eos> burns but more clearly . o she had not these ways <eos> when all the wild summer was in her gaze <eos> o heart ! o heart ! if she 'd but turn her head <eos> you 'd know the folly of being comforted <eos>
is it for fear to wet a widow 's eye <eos> that thou consum'st thy self in single life <eos> ah , if thou issueless shalt hap to die <eos> the world will wail thee like a makeless wife <eos> the world will be thy widow and still weep <eos> that thou no form of thee hast left behind <eos> when every private widow well may keep <eos> by children 's eyes , her husband 's shape in mind <eos> look what an unthrift in the world doth spend <eos> shifts but his place , for still the world enjoys it <eos> but beauty 's waste hath in the world an end <eos> and kept unused the user so destroys it <eos> no love toward others in that bosom sits <eos> that on himself such murd'rous shame commits <eos>

round the rich throne , in various lustre dight <eos> gems undistinguished cast a changing light <eos> sapphire and emerald soften down the scene <eos> cold azure mingling with the vernal green <eos> pearl , amber , ruby warmer flames unfold <eos> and diamonds brighten from the burning gold <eos> thro all the dome the living blazes blend <eos> and shoot their rainbows where the arches bend <eos> on every ceiling , painted light and gay <eos> symbolic forms their graphic art display <eos> recording , confident of endless fame <eos> each feat of arms , each patriarchal name <eos> like memphian hieroglyphs , to stretch the span <eos> of memory frail in momentary man <eos>
when we kept our watch in the cold and damp <eos> if the cattle broke from the sleeping camp <eos> over the flats and across the plain <eos> with my head bent down on his waving mane <eos> through the boughs above and the stumps below <eos> on the darkest night i could let him go <eos> at a racing speed ; he would choose his course <eos> and my life was safe with the old grey horse <eos> but man and horse had a favourite job <eos> when an outlaw broke from a station mob <eos> with a right good will was the stockwhip plied <eos> as the old horse raced at the straggler 's side <eos> and the greenhide whip such a weal would raise <eos> we could use the whip in the droving days <eos>
in the lone tent , waiting for victory <eos> she stands with eyes marred by the mists of pain <eos> like some wan lily overdrenched with rain <eos> the clamorous clang of arms , the ensanguined sky <eos> war 's ruin , and the wreck of chivalry <eos> to her proud soul no common fear can bring <eos> bravely she tarrieth for her lord the king <eos> her soul a flame with passionate ecstasy <eos> o hair of gold ! o crimson lips ! o face <eos> made for the luring and the love of man <eos> with thee i do forget the toil and stress <eos> the loveless road that knows no resting place <eos> time 's straitened pulse , the soul 's dread weariness <eos> my freedom , and my life republican <eos>
long while i sought to what i might compare <eos> those powrefull eies which lighten my dark spright <eos> yet find i nought on earth , to which i dare <eos> resemble th'ymage of their goodly light <eos> not to the sun , for they doo shine by night <eos> nor to the moone , for they are changed never <eos> nor to the starres , for they have purer sight <eos> nor to the fire , for they consume not ever <eos> nor to the lightning , for they still persever <eos> nor to the diamond , for they are more tender <eos> nor unto cristall , for nought may them sever <eos> nor unto glasse , such basenesse mought offend her <eos> then to the maker selfe they likest be <eos> whose light doth lighten all that here we see <eos>
when we consider what this life we lead <eos> is not , and is ; how full of toil and pain <eos> how blank of rest and of substantial gain <eos> beset by hunger earth can never feed <eos> and propping half our hearts upon a reed <eos> we cease to mourn lost treasures mourned in vain <eos> lost treasures we are fain and yet not fain <eos> to fetch back for a solace of our need <eos> for who that feel this burden and this strain <eos> this wide vacuity of hope and heart <eos> would bring their cherished well beloved again <eos> to bleed with them and wince beneath the smart <eos> to have with stinted bliss such lavish bane <eos> to hold in lieu of all so poor a part <eos>
when i consider how my light is spent <eos> ere half my days , in this dark world and wide <eos> and that one talent which is death to hide <eos> lodg 'd with me useless , though my soul more bent <eos> to serve therewith my maker , and present <eos> my true account , lest he , returning , chide <eos> doth god exact day labour , light denied <eos> i fondly ask : but patience , to prevent <eos> that murmur , soon replies , god doth not need <eos> either man 's work , or his own gifts ; who best <eos> bear his mild yoke , they serve him best ; his state <eos> is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed <eos> and post o'er land and ocean without rest <eos> they also serve who only stand and wait <eos>
she leans , and there is laughter in the face <eos> she turns towards him ; and it seems a door <eos> suddenly opened on some desolate place <eos> with a burst of light and music . what before <eos> was hidden shines in loveliness revealed <eos> now first he sees her beautiful , and knows <eos> that he must love her ; and the doom is sealed <eos> of all his happiness and all the woes <eos> that shall be born of pregnant years hereafter <eos> the swift poise of a head , a flutter of laughter <eos> and love flows in on him , its vastness pent <eos> within his narrow life : the pain it brings <eos> boundless ; for love is infinite discontent <eos> with the poor lonely life of transient things <eos>
not sweeter to the storm tossed mariner <eos> is glimpse of home , where wife and children wait <eos> to welcome him with kisses at the gate <eos> than to the town worn man the breezy stir <eos> of mountain winds on rugged pathless heights <eos> his long pent soul drinks in the deep delights <eos> that nature hath in store . the sun kissed bay <eos> gleams thro ’ the grand old gnarled gum tree boughs <eos> like burnished brass ; the strong winged bird of prey <eos> sweeps by , upon his lonely vengeful way <eos> while over all , like breath of holy vows <eos> the sweet airs blow , and the high vaulted sky <eos> looks down in pity this fair summer day <eos> on all poor earth born creatures doomed to die <eos>
‘ twas but a moment , for that respect <eos> which clothes all courage their voices checked <eos> and something the wildest could understand <eos> spake in the old man 's strong right hand <eos> and his corded throat , and the lurking frown <eos> of his eyebrows under his old bell crown <eos> until , as they gazed , there crept an awe <eos> through the ranks in whispers , and some men saw <eos> in the antique vestments and long white hair <eos> the past of the nation in battle there <eos> and some of the soldiers since declare <eos> that the gleam of his old white hat afar <eos> like the crested plume of the brave navarre <eos> that day was their oriflamme of war <eos>
meantime the trojan sends his troops ashore <eos> some are by boats expos 'd , by bridges more <eos> with lab'ring oars they bear along the strand <eos> where the tide languishes , and leap aland <eos> tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes <eos> and , where no ford he finds , no water fries <eos> nor billows with unequal murmurs roar <eos> but smoothly slide along , and swell the shore <eos> that course he steer 'd , and thus he gave command <eos> “ here ply your oars , and at all hazard land <eos> force on the vessel , that her keel may wound <eos> this hated soil , and furrow hostile ground <eos> let me securely land i ask no more <eos> then sink my ships , or shatter on the shore <eos>
oh , had we room to rip the mighty bags <eos> that time , the harlequin , has stuffed with rags <eos> grant us one moment to unloose the strings <eos> while the old graybeard shuts his leather wings <eos> but what a heap of motley trash appears <eos> crammed in the bundles of successive years <eos> as the lost rustic on some festal day <eos> stares through the concourse in its vast array <eos> where in one cake a throng of faces runs <eos> all stuck together like a sheet of buns <eos> and throws the bait of some unheeded name <eos> or shoots a wink with most uncertain aim <eos> so roams my vision , wandering over all <eos> and strives to choose , but knows not where to fall <eos>
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem <eos> by that sweet ornament which truth doth give <eos> the rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem <eos> for that sweet odour which doth in it live <eos> the canker blooms have full as deep a dye <eos> as the perfumed tincture of the roses <eos> hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly <eos> when summer 's breath their masked buds discloses <eos> but for their virtue only is their show <eos> they live unwoo 'd and unrespected fade <eos> die to themselves . sweet roses do not so <eos> of then sweet deaths are sweetest odours made <eos> and so of you , beauteous and lovely youth <eos> when that shall fade , my verse distils your truth <eos>
he said , and sorrow touch ’ d each argive breast <eos> the soul of ajax burn ’ d above the rest <eos> as by his side the groaning warrior fell <eos> at the fierce foe he launch ’ d his piercing steel <eos> the foe , reclining , shunn ’ d the flying death <eos> but fate , archilochus , demands thy breath <eos> thy lofty birth no succour could impart <eos> the wings of death o ’ ertook thee on the dart <eos> swift to perform heaven ’ s fatal will , it fled <eos> full on the juncture of the neck and head <eos> and took the joint , and cut the nerves in twain <eos> the dropping head first tumbled on the plain <eos> so just the stroke , that yet the body stood <eos> erect , then roll ’ d along the sands in blood <eos>
it may be , love my death doth not pretend <eos> although he shoots at me , but thinks it fit <eos> thus to bewitch thee for thy benefit <eos> causing thy will to my wish to condescend <eos> for witches which some murder do intend <eos> do make a picture and do shoot at it <eos> and in that part where they the picture hit <eos> the party 's self doth languish to his end <eos> so love , too weak by force thy heart to taint <eos> within my heart thy heavenly shape doth paint <eos> suffering therein his arrows to abide <eos> only to th'end he might by witches ’ art <eos> within my heart pierce through thy picture 's side <eos> and through thy picture 's side might wound my heart <eos>
that , that was not apollo , not the god <eos> this was not venus , though she venus seemed <eos> a moment . and though fair yon river move <eos> she , all the way , from disenchanted fount <eos> to seas unhallowed runs ; the gods forsook <eos> long since her trembling rushes ; from her plains <eos> disconsolate , long since adventure fled <eos> and now although the inviting river flows <eos> and every poplared cape , and every bend <eos> or willowy islet , win upon thy soul <eos> and to thy hopeful shallop whisper speed <eos> yet hope not thou at all ; hope is no more <eos> and o , long since the golden groves are dead <eos> the fa ë ry cities vanished from the land <eos>
impetuous steams in spiral colums rise <eos> through rifted rocks , impatient for the skies <eos> or o'er bright seas of bubbling lavas blow <eos> 180 as heave and toss the billowy fires below <eos> condensed on high , in wandering rills they glide <eos> from maffon 's dome , and burst his sparry side <eos> round his grey towers , and down his fringed walls <eos> from cliff to cliff , the liquid treasure falls <eos> 185 in beds of stalactite , bright ores among <eos> o'er corals , shells , and crystals , winds along <eos> crusts the green mosses , and the tangled wood <eos> and sparkling plunges to its parent flood <eos> — o'er the warm wave a smiling youth presides <eos> 190 attunes its murmurs , its meanders guides <eos>
woe to mine eyes , the organs of mine ill <eos> hate to my heart , for not concealing joy <eos> a double curse upon my tongue be still <eos> whose babbling lost what else i might enjoy <eos> when first mine eyes did with thy beauty joy <eos> they to my heart thy wondrous virtues told <eos> who , fearing lest thy beams should him destroy <eos> whate'er he knew , did to my tongue unfold <eos> my tell tale tongue , in talking over bold <eos> what they in private council did declare <eos> to thee , in plain and public terms unrolled <eos> and so by that made thee more coyer far <eos> what in thy praise he spoke , that didst thou trust <eos> and yet my sorrows thou dost hold unjust <eos>
if that my sensual deed had stol'n from thee <eos> aught that were part of thy most precious love <eos> or made to swerve the loving soul of me <eos> that to thy service it should duller prove <eos> had't made to me thy grace less gracious seem <eos> thy worth less worth , thy love a smaller prize <eos> or bated aught of thy most rich esteem <eos> which still grew richer in thy servant 's eyes <eos> then were it fault too foul to find excuse <eos> and all i writ of thee were vows untrue <eos> my verse were nought but idle poet 's use <eos> conceit 's worn weeds lac 'd o'er with wording new <eos> but ‘ twas not so ; though true my love before <eos> ‘ twas thenceforth purg 'd , and priz 'd thee all the more <eos>
“ beloved vale ! ” i said , “ when i shall con <eos> those many records of my childish years <eos> remembrance of myself and of my peers <eos> will press me down : to think of what is gone <eos> will be an awful thought , if life have one <eos> but , when into the vale i came , no fears <eos> distress 'd me ; i look 'd round , i shed no tears <eos> deep thought , or awful vision , i had none <eos> by thousand petty fancies i was cross 'd <eos> to see the trees , which i had thought so tall <eos> mere dwarfs ; the brooks so narrow , fields so small <eos> a juggler 's balls old time about him toss 'd <eos> i looked , i stared , i smiled , i laughed ; and all <eos> the weight of sadness was in wonder lost <eos>
“ you know , you dogs , your master long has felt <eos> a keen distemper in the royal pelt <eos> a testy , superficial irritation <eos> brought home , i fancy , from some foreign nation <eos> for this a thousand simples you 've prescribed <eos> unguents external , draughts to be imbibed <eos> you 've plundered scotland of its plants , the seas <eos> you 've ravished , and despoiled the hebrides <eos> to brew me remedies which , in probation <eos> were sovereign only in their application <eos> in vain , and eke in pain , have i applied <eos> your flattering unctions to my soul and hide <eos> physic and hope have been my daily food <eos> i 've swallowed treacle by the holy rood <eos>
as one of some fat tillage dispossessed <eos> weighing the yield of these four faded years <eos> if any ask what fruit seems loveliest <eos> what lasting gold among the garnered ears <eos> ah , then i 'll say what hours i had of thine <eos> therein i reaped time 's richest revenue <eos> read in thy text the sense of david 's line <eos> through thee achieved the love that shakespeare knew <eos> take then his book , laden with mine own love <eos> as flowers made sweeter by deep drunken rain <eos> that when years sunder and between us move <eos> wide waters , and less kindly bonds constrain <eos> thou may'st turn here , dear boy , and reading see <eos> some part of what thy friend once felt for thee <eos>

thou wouldst have led us through the twilight land <eos> where spirit shows by form , form is refined <eos> away to spirit by transfiguring mind <eos> till they are one , and in the morn we stand <eos> treading thy footsteps , children , hand in hand <eos> with sense divinely growing , till , combined <eos> we heard the music of the planets wind <eos> in harmony with billows on the strand <eos> till , one with earth and all god 's utterance <eos> we hardly knew whether the sun outspake <eos> or a glad sunshine from our spirits brake <eos> whether we think , or windy leaflets dance <eos> alas , o poet leader ! for this good <eos> thou wert god 's tragedy , writ in tears and blood <eos>
so is it with this singing art of ours <eos> that once with maids went maidenlike , and played <eos> with woven dances in the poplar shade <eos> and all her song was but of lady 's bowers <eos> and the returning swallows , and spring flowers <eos> till forth to seek a shadow queen she strayed <eos> a shadowy land ; and now hath overweighed <eos> her singing chaplet with the snow and showers <eos> yea , fair well water for the bitter brine <eos> she left , and by the margin of life 's sea <eos> sings , and her song is full of the sea 's moan <eos> and wild with dread , and love of proserpine <eos> and whoso once has listened to her , he <eos> his whole life long is slave to her alone <eos>
i writ how once i wander 'd from thy side <eos> serving the strong suggestions of my blood <eos> only to prove from worse things vainly tried <eos> how far more precious grew thy sum of good <eos> if i so lov 'd thee , what is my defence <eos> that thy dear love fail 'd then my steps to stay <eos> that idle hours were idly given to sense <eos> and soul forsaken at the call of clay <eos> o let love grant excuse ; my sensual part <eos> dwelt ever far from pure untainted thee <eos> it held no conversation with my heart <eos> nor , us 'd or check 'd , could be thine injury <eos> if once it triumph 'd , carrying me away <eos> it stole but earth ; my soul did with thee stay <eos>

the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts <eos> and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts <eos> at this , the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook <eos> a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look <eos> she sees , and trembles at th ’ approaching ill <eos> just in the jaws of ruin , and codille <eos> and now ( as oft in some distempered state <eos> on one nice trick depends the general fate <eos> an ace of hearts steps forth : the king unseen <eos> lurked in her hand , and mourned his captive queen <eos> he springs to vengeance with an eager pace <eos> and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace <eos> the nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky <eos> the walls , the woods , and long canals reply <eos>
thus raged both armies like conflicting fires <eos> while nestor ’ s chariot far from fight retires <eos> his coursers steep ’ d in sweat , and stain ’ d with gore <eos> the greeks ’ preserver , great machaon , bore <eos> that hour achilles , from the topmost height <eos> of his proud fleet , o ’ erlook ’ d the fields of fight <eos> his feasted eyes beheld around the plain <eos> the grecian rout , the slaying , and the slain <eos> his friend machaon singled from the rest <eos> a transient pity touch ’ d his vengeful breast <eos> straight to menoetius ’ much loved son he sent <eos> graceful as mars , patroclus quits his tent <eos> in evil hour ! then fate decreed his doom <eos> and fix ’ d the date of all his woes to come <eos>
i pray to be the tool which to your hand <eos> long use has shaped and moulded till it be <eos> apt for your need , and , unconsideringly <eos> you take it for its service . i demand <eos> to be forgotten in the woven strand <eos> which grows the multi coloured tapestry <eos> of your bright life , and through its tissues lie <eos> a hidden , strong , sustaining , grey toned band <eos> i wish to dwell around your daylight dreams <eos> the railing to the stairway of the clouds <eos> to guard your steps securely up , where streams <eos> a faery moonshine washing pale the crowds <eos> of pointed stars . remember not whereby <eos> you mount , protected , to the far flung sky <eos>

was it the moon , or was it morning 's ray <eos> that call 'd thee , dearest , from these arms away <eos> scarce hadst thou left me , when a dream of night <eos> came o'er my spirit so distinct and bright <eos> that , while i yet can vividly recall <eos> its witching wonders , thou shall hear them all <eos> methought i saw , upon the lunar beam <eos> two winged boys , such as thy muse might dream <eos> descending from above , at that still hour <eos> and gliding , with smooth step , into my bower <eos> fair as the beauteous spirits that , all day <eos> in amatha 's warm founts imprisoned stay <eos> but rise at midnight , from the enchanted rill <eos> to cool their plumes upon some moonlight hill <eos>
i see gray teachers ,— on their work intent <eos> their lavished lives , in endless labor spent <eos> had closed at last in age and penury wrecked <eos> martyrs , not burned , but frozen in neglect <eos> save for the generous hands that stretched in aid <eos> of worn out servants left to die half paid <eos> ah , many a year will pass , i thought , ere we <eos> such kindly forethought shall rejoice to see <eos> monarchs are mindful of the sacred debt <eos> that cold republics hasten to forget <eos> i see the priest ,— if such a name he bears <eos> who without pride his sacred vestment wears <eos> and while the symbols of his tribe i seek <eos> thus my first impulse bids me think and speak <eos>

then did a sharped spyre of diamond bright <eos> ten feete each way in square , appeare to mee <eos> iustly proportion 'd up unto his hight <eos> so far as archer might his level see <eos> the top thereof a pot did seeme to beare <eos> made of the mettall which we most do honour <eos> and in this golden vessel couched weare <eos> the ashes of a mightie emperour <eos> upon foure corners of the base were pight <eos> to beare the frame , foure great lyons of gold <eos> a worthy tombe for such a worthy wight <eos> alas ! this world doth nought but grievance hold <eos> i saw a tempest from the heaven descend <eos> which this brave monument with flash did rend <eos>
o wholesome death , thy sombre funeral car <eos> looms ever dimly on the lengthening way <eos> of life ; while , lengthening still , in sad array <eos> my deeds in long procession go , that are <eos> as mourners of the man they helped to mar <eos> i see it all in dreams , such as waylay <eos> the wandering fancy when the solid day <eos> has fallen in smoldering ruins , and night 's star <eos> aloft there , with its steady point of light <eos> mastering the eye , has wrapped the brain in sleep <eos> ah , when i die , and planets take their flight <eos> above my grave , still let my spirit keep <eos> sometimes its vigil of divine remorse <eos> ‘ midst pity , praise , or blame heaped o'er my corse <eos>
eventful volume ! whatsoe'er the change <eos> of scene and clime — the adventures bold and strange <eos> the griefs — the frailties but too frankly told <eos> the loves , the feuds thy pages may unfold <eos> if truth with half so prompt a hand unlocks <eos> his virtues as his failings , we shall find <eos> the record there of friendships held like rocks <eos> and enmities like sun touched snow resigned <eos> of fealty , cherisht without change or chill <eos> in those who served him , young , and serve him still <eos> of generous aid given , with that noiseless art <eos> which wakes not pride , to many a wounded heart <eos> of acts — but , no — not from himself must aught <eos> of the bright features of his life be sought <eos>
if heav'n a date of many years wou 'd give <eos> thus i 'd in pleasure , ease and plenty live <eos> and as i near approach 'd the verge of life <eos> some kind relation ( for i 'd have no wife <eos> should take upon him all my worldly care <eos> while i did for a better state prepare <eos> then i 'd not be with any trouble vext <eos> nor have the evening of my days perplext <eos> but by a silent , and a peaceful death <eos> without a sigh , resign my aged breath <eos> and when committed to the dust , i 'd have <eos> few tears , but friendly drop 'd into my grave <eos> then wou 'd my exit so propitious be <eos> all men wou 'd wish to live and dye like me <eos>
yet , ‘ midst the blaze of courts , she fix 'd her love <eos> on the cool fountain , or the shady grove <eos> still , with the shepherd 's innocence , her mind <eos> to the sweet vale , and flowery mead , inclined <eos> and oft as spring renew 'd the plains with flowers <eos> breathed his soft gales , and led the fragrant hours <eos> with sure return she sought the sylvan scene <eos> the breezy mountains , and the forests green <eos> her maids around her moved , a duteous band <eos> each bore a crook , all rural , in her hand <eos> some simple lay , of flocks and herds , they sung <eos> with joy the mountain and the forest rung <eos> ‘ be every youth like royal abbas moved <eos> ‘ and every georgian maid like abra loved <eos>
we wander on through life as pilgrims do <eos> o'er trackless deserts to a distant shrine <eos> weary and parch 'd , and to our longing view <eos> springs many a false mirage of joy divine <eos> that fades before us as we fain pursue <eos> the empty picture which our fancy drew <eos> o thou , my heart ! seek not the empty shows <eos> and gilded nothings of this little time <eos> but let thine endless effort be to climb <eos> above earth 's petty vanities and woes <eos> unto a nobler range of feelings , joys <eos> which no false leaven of decay alloys <eos> but whose substantial sweetness may increase <eos> and make thy journey pleasure , and thy slumber peace <eos>
the heroes of the present and the past <eos> were puny , vague , and nothingness to thee <eos> thou didst a span grasp mighty to the last <eos> and strain for glory when thy die was cast <eos> that little island , on the atlantic sea <eos> was but a dust spot in a lake : thy mind <eos> swept space as shoreless as eternity <eos> thy giant powers outstript this gaudy age <eos> of heroes ; and , as looking at the sun <eos> so gazing on thy greatness , made men blind <eos> to merits , that had adoration won <eos> in olden times . the world was on thy page <eos> of victories but a comma . fame could find <eos> no parallel , thy greatness to presage <eos>
in the dim chamber whence but yesterday <eos> passed my belov è d , filled with awe i stand <eos> and haunting loves fluttering on every hand <eos> whisper her praises who is far away <eos> a thousand delicate fancies glance and play <eos> on every object which her robes have fanned <eos> and tenderest thoughts and hopes bloom and expand <eos> in the sweet memory of her beauty 's ray <eos> ah ! could that glass but hold the faintest trace <eos> of all the loveliness once mirrored there <eos> the clustering glory of the shadowy hair <eos> that framed so well the dear young angel face <eos> but no , it shows my own face , full of care <eos> and my heart is her beauty 's dwelling place <eos>
xv . as he that parts in hatred from a friend <eos> mixing with other men forgets the woe <eos> which anguished him when he beheld and lo <eos> two souls had fled asunder which did bend <eos> under the same blue heaven ! yet ere the end <eos> when the loud world hath tossed him to and fro <eos> will often strangely reappear that glow <eos> at simplest memory which some chance may send <eos> although much stronger bonds have lost their power <eos> so thou god sent didst come in lowly guise <eos> striking on simple chords ,— not with surprise <eos> or mightiest recollectings in that hour <eos> but like remembered fragrance of a flower <eos> a man with human heart and loving eyes <eos>
upon a cloud among the stars we stood <eos> the angel raised his hand and looked and said <eos> “ which world , of all yon starry myriad <eos> shall we make wing to ? ” the still solitude <eos> became a harp whereon his voice and mood <eos> made spheral music round his haloed head <eos> i spake — for then i had not long been dead <eos> “ let me look round upon the vasts , and brood <eos> a moment on these orbs ere i decide <eos> what is yon lower star that beauteous shines <eos> and with soft splendour now incarnadines <eos> our wings ? — there would i go and there abide <eos> then he as one who some child 's thought divines <eos> “ that is the world where yesternight you died <eos>
the matron woo 'd her kindness to the last <eos> but could not win ; her hour of grace was past <eos> whom , thus persisting , when she could not bring <eos> to leave the wolf , and to believe her king <eos> she gave her up , and fairly wish 'd her joy <eos> of her late treaty with her new ally <eos> which well she hoped would more successful prove <eos> than was the pigeon 's and the buzzard 's love <eos> the panther ask 'd what concord there could be <eos> betwixt two kinds whose natures disagree <eos> the dame replied : ‘ tis sung in every street <eos> the common chat of gossips when they meet <eos> but , since unheard by you , ‘ tis worth your while <eos> to take a wholesome tale , though told in homely style <eos>

these sorrowing sighs , the smoke of mine annoy <eos> these tears , which heat of sacred flame distils <eos> are those due tributes that my faith doth pay <eos> unto the tyrant whose unkindness kills <eos> i sacrifice my youth and blooming years <eos> at her proud feet , and she respects not it <eos> my flower , untimely 's withered with my tears <eos> by winter woes for spring of youth unfit <eos> she thinks a look may recompense my care <eos> and so with looks prolongs my long looked ease <eos> as short that bliss , so is the comfort rare <eos> yet must that bliss my hungry thoughts appease <eos> thus she returns my hopes so fruitless ever <eos> once let her love indeed , or eye me never <eos>

i know not why , but all this weary day <eos> suggested by no definite grief or pain <eos> sad fancies have been flitting through my brain <eos> now it has been a vessel losing way <eos> rounding a stormy headland ; now a gray <eos> dull waste of clouds above a wintry main <eos> and then , a banner , drooping in the rain <eos> and meadows beaten into bloody clay <eos> strolling at random with this shadowy woe <eos> at heart , i chanced to wander hither ! lo <eos> a league of desolate marsh land , with its lush <eos> hot grasses in a noisome , tide left bed <eos> and faint , warm airs , that rustle in the hush <eos> like whispers round the body of the dead <eos>

for sunday 's play he never makes excuse <eos> but plays at taw , and buys his spanish juice <eos> hard as his toil , and ever slow to speak <eos> yet he gives maidens many a burning cheek <eos> for none can pass him but his witless grace <eos> of bawdry brings the blushes in her face <eos> as vulgar as the dirt he treads upon <eos> he calls his cows or drives his horses on <eos> he knows the lamest cow and strokes her side <eos> and often tries to mount her back and ride <eos> and takes her tail at night in idle play <eos> and makes her drag him homeward all the way <eos> he knows of nothing but the football match <eos> and where hens lay , and when the duck will hatch <eos>
oh ! might these sighs and tears return again <eos> into my breast and eyes which i have spent <eos> that i might , in this holy discontent <eos> mourn with some fruit , as i have mourned in vain <eos> in mine idolatry what showers of rain <eos> mine eyes did waste ! what griefs my heart did rent <eos> that sufferance was my sin i now repent <eos> ‘ cause i did suffer , i must suffer pain <eos> the hydroptic drunkard , and night scouting thief <eos> the itchy lecher , and self tickling proud <eos> have th ’ remembrance of past joys for relief <eos> of coming ills . to poor me is allow 'd <eos> no ease ; for long yet vehement grief hath been <eos> the effect and cause , the punishment and sin <eos>
miracle of the world ! i never will deny <eos> that former poets praise the beauty of their days <eos> but all those beauties were but figures of thy praise <eos> and all those poets did of thee but prophesy <eos> thy coming to the world hath taught us to descry <eos> what petrarch 's laura meant , for truth the lip bewrays <eos> lo , why th ’ italians , yet which never saw thy rays <eos> to find out petrarch 's sense such forg è d glosses try <eos> the beauties which he in a veil enclosed beheld <eos> but revelations were within his surest heart <eos> by which in parables thy coming he foretold <eos> his songs were hymns of thee , which only now before <eos> thy image should be sung ; for thou that goddess art <eos> which only we without idolatry adore <eos>

a graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve <eos> venice and winter , hand in deadly hand <eos> have slain the lover of her sunbright strand <eos> and singer of a stormbright christmas eve <eos> a graceless guerdon we that loved receive <eos> for all our love , from that the dearest land <eos> love worshipped ever . blithe and soft and bland <eos> too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave <eos> shone on our dreams and memories evermore <eos> the domes , the towers , the mountains and the shore <eos> that gird or guard thee , venice : cold and black <eos> seems now the face we loved as he of yore <eos> we have given thee love — no stint , no stay , no lack <eos> what gift , what gift is this thou hast given us back <eos>
when i perceive love 's heavenly reaping still <eos> regard perforce the clouds ’ vicissitude <eos> that the fixed spirit loves not when it will <eos> but craves its seasons of the flawful blood <eos> when i perceive that the high poet doth <eos> oft voiceless stray beneath the uninfluent stars <eos> that even urania of her kiss is loath <eos> and song 's brave wings fret on their sensual bars <eos> when i perceived the fullest sail ed sprite <eos> lag at most need upon the leth ed seas <eos> the provident captainship oft voided quite <eos> and lam ed lie deep draughted argosies <eos> i scorn myself , that put for such strange toys <eos> the wit of man to purposes of boys <eos>
frown ever opposite , the angel cried <eos> who , with an earthquake 's might and giant hand <eos> severed these riven rocks , and bade them stand <eos> severed for ever ! the vast ocean tide <eos> leaving its roar without at his command <eos> shrank , and beneath the woods through the green land <eos> went gently murmuring on , so to deride <eos> the frowning barriers that its force defied <eos> but art , high o'er the trailing smoke below <eos> of sea bound steamer , on yon summit 's head <eos> sat musing ; and where scarce a wandering crow <eos> sailed o'er the chasm , in thought a highway led <eos> conquering , as by an arrow from a bow <eos> the scene 's lone genius by her elfin thread <eos>
why is my verse so barren of new pride <eos> so far from variation or quick change <eos> why with the time do i not glance aside <eos> to new found methods , and to compounds strange <eos> why write i still all one , ever the same <eos> and keep invention in a noted weed <eos> that every word doth almost tell my name <eos> showing their birth , and where they did proceed <eos> o know sweet love i always write of you <eos> and you and love are still my argument <eos> so all my best is dressing old words new <eos> spending again what is already spent <eos> for as the sun is daily new and old <eos> so is my love still telling what is told <eos>

she back four paces drew , at first , through shame <eos> then , led by love , eight others forward came <eos> but scruples still arose that ardour foiled <eos> and nearly ey'ry thing had truly spoiled <eos> anne had a conscience pure as holy fire <eos> but how could she abstain from soft desire <eos> if , in the bosom chance a flame should raise <eos> is there a pow'r can then subdue the blaze <eos> at first these inclinations she withstood <eos> but doubting soon , how those of flesh and blood <eos> could sins commit by stepping in advance <eos> she took her seat upon the green expanse <eos> and there attentively the lad observed <eos> with eyes that scarcely from him ever swerved <eos>

thy words are torture to me , that scarce grieve thee <eos> that entire death shall null my entire thought <eos> and i feel torture , not that i believe thee <eos> but that i cannot disbelieve thee not <eos> shall that of me that now contains the stars <eos> be by the very contained stars survived <eos> thus were fate all unjust . yet what truth bars <eos> an all unjust fate ’ s truth from being believed <eos> conjecture cannot fit to the seen world <eos> a garment of its thought untorn or covering <eos> or with its stuffed garb forge an otherworld <eos> without itself its dead deceit discovering <eos> so , all being possible , an idle thought may <eos> less idle thoughts , self known no truer , dismay <eos>

o thou who dost know what the heart fain would hide <eos> who ever art ready whate'er may betide <eos> in whom the distressed can hope in their woe <eos> whose ears with the groans of the wretched are plied <eos> still bid thy good gifts from thy treasury flow <eos> all good is assembled where thou dost abide <eos> to thee , save my poverty , nought can i show <eos> and of thee all my poverty 's wants are supplied <eos> what choice have i save to thy portal to go <eos> if ‘ tis shut , to what other my steps can i guide <eos> ‘ fore whom as a suppliant low shall i bow <eos> if thy bounty to me , thy poor slave , is denied <eos> but oh : though rebellious full often i grow <eos> thy bounty and kindness are not the less wide <eos>
cherish you then the hope i shall forget <eos> at length , my lord , pieria ?— put away <eos> for your so passing sake , this mouth of clay <eos> these mortal bones against my body set <eos> for all the puny fever and frail sweat <eos> of human love ,— renounce for these , i say <eos> the singing mountain 's memory , and betray <eos> the silent lyre that hangs upon me yet <eos> ah , but indeed , some day shall you awake <eos> rather , from dreams of me , that at your side <eos> so many nights , a lover and a bride <eos> but stern in my soul 's chastity , have lain <eos> to walk the world forever for my sake <eos> and in each chamber find me gone again <eos>

what matters that her multitudinous store <eos> the garnered fruit of measureless desire <eos> sank in the maelstrom of abysmal fire <eos> to be of man beheld on earth no more <eos> her loyal children , cheery to the core <eos> quailed not , nor blenched , while she , above the ire <eos> of elemental ragings , dared aspire <eos> on victory 's wings resplendently to soar <eos> what matters all the losses of the years <eos> since she can count the subjects as her own <eos> that share her fortunes under every fate <eos> who weave their brightest tissues from her tears <eos> and who , although her best be overthrown <eos> resolve to make her and to keep her great <eos>

in a false dream i saw the foe prevail <eos> the war was ended ; the last smoke had rolled <eos> away : and we , erewhile the strong and bold <eos> stood broken , humbled , withered , weak and pale <eos> and moan 'd , “ our greatness is become a tale <eos> to tell our children 's babes when we are old <eos> they shall put by their playthings to be told <eos> how england once , before the years of bale <eos> throned above trembling , puissant , grandiose , calm <eos> held asia 's richest jewel in her palm <eos> and with unnumbered isles barbaric , she <eos> the broad hem of her glistering robe impearl 'd <eos> then , when she wound her arms about the world <eos> and had for vassal the obsequious sea <eos>

the learned teacher satisfaction showed <eos> that such success from his instructions flowed <eos> laughed heartily at husbands , silly wights <eos> who had not wit to guard connubial rights <eos> and from their lamb the wily wolf to keep <eos> a shepherd will o'erlook a hundred sheep <eos> while foolish man 's unable to protect <eos> e'en one where most he 'd wish to be correct <eos> howe'er , this care he thought was somewhat hard <eos> but not a thing impossible to guard <eos> and if he had not got a hundred eyes <eos> thank heav'n , his wife , though cunning to devise <eos> he could defy :— her thoughts so well he knew <eos> that these intrigues she never would pursue <eos>

i grant thou wert not married to my muse <eos> and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook <eos> the dedicated words which writers use <eos> of their fair subject , blessing every book <eos> thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue <eos> finding thy worth a limit past my praise <eos> and therefore art enforced to seek anew <eos> some fresher stamp of the time bettering days <eos> and do so love , yet when they have devised <eos> what strained touches rhetoric can lend <eos> thou truly fair , wert truly sympathized <eos> in true plain words , by thy true telling friend <eos> and their gross painting might be better used <eos> where cheeks need blood , in thee it is abused <eos>
by four fond swains in playful circles drawn <eos> on glowing wheels she tracks the moon bright lawn <eos> mounts the rude cliff , unveils her blushing charms <eos> 230 and calls the panting zephyrs to her arms <eos> emerged from ocean springs the vaporous air <eos> bathes her light limbs , uncurls her amber hair <eos> incrusts her beamy form with films saline <eos> and beauty blazes through the crystal shrine <eos> 235 so with pellucid studs the ice flower gems <eos> her rimy foliage , and her candied stems <eos> so from his glassy horns , and pearly eyes <eos> the diamond beetle darts a thousand dyes <eos> mounts with enamel 'd wings the vesper gale <eos> 240 and wheeling shines in adamantine mail <eos>
the only bird alone that nature frames <eos> when weary of the tedious life she lives <eos> by fire dies , yet finds new life in flames <eos> her ashes to her shape new essence gives <eos> when only i , the only wretched wight <eos> weary of life that breathes but sorrow 's blast <eos> pursue the flame of such a beauty bright <eos> that burns my heart , and yet my life still lasts <eos> o sovereign light , that with thy sacred flame <eos> consumes my life , revive me after this <eos> and make me , with the happy bird , the same <eos> that dies to live , by favour of thy bliss <eos> this deed of thine will show a goddess ’ power <eos> in so long death to grant one living hour <eos>
if so it hap this offspring of my care <eos> these fatal anthems , lamentable songs <eos> come to their view , who like afflicted are <eos> let them yet sigh their own , and moan my wrongs <eos> but untouched hearts with unaffected eye <eos> approach not to behold my soul 's distress <eos> clear sighted you soon note what is awry <eos> whilst blinded souls mine errors never guess <eos> you blinded souls , whom youth and error lead <eos> you outcast eaglets dazzled with your sun <eos> do you , and none but you , my sorrows read <eos> you best can judge the wrongs that she hath done <eos> that she hath done , the motive of my pain <eos> who whilst i love doth kill me with disdain <eos>
we bowled along the pleasant country lanes <eos> by wooded heights and blossom covered plains <eos> see ! said he , there 's my house among the trees <eos> sheltered , yet open to the southern breeze <eos> in that beyond , with other two , you see <eos> whose grounds close round my own so pleasantly <eos> live valued friends of whom i never tire <eos> with each abode a telegraphic wire <eos> communicates , so , when we feel inclined <eos> for whist or billiards , after we have dined <eos> we telegraph to fix the time and place <eos> and oft arrange a meet for hunt and chase <eos> which is convenient , as you soon will see <eos> and makes us like one social family <eos>
as jove 's increase , who from his brain was born <eos> whom arms and arts did equally adorn <eos> free of the breast was bred , whose milky taste <eos> minerva 's name to venus had debased <eos> so this imperial babe rejects the food <eos> that mixes monarch 's with plebeian blood <eos> food that his inborn courage might control <eos> extinguish all the father in his soul <eos> and , for his estian race , and saxon strain <eos> might reproduce some second richard 's reign <eos> mildness he shares from both his parents ’ blood <eos> but kings too tame are despicably good <eos> be this the mixture of this regal child <eos> by nature manly , but by virtue mild <eos>
— nor for myself nor any other . yet <eos> i cannot but remember all that passed <eos> since justice shook these bosoms , and the fret <eos> of indignation stirred them and they cast <eos> forgot aside all lesser wrongs , and rose <eos> against the spiritual evil of that threat <eos> that made them of dishonour slaves or foes <eos> and who may but with pride remember how <eos> not by ten righteous justice might be saved <eos> but by unsaintly millions moving all <eos> as the tide moves when myriad tossed waves flow <eos> one way , and on the crumbling bastions fall <eos> then sinking backwards unopposed and slow <eos> over the ruined towers where those vain angers raved <eos>
within this wood , out of a rock did rise <eos> a spring of water , mildly rumbling down <eos> whereto approached not in any wise <eos> the homely shepherd nor the ruder clown <eos> but many muses and the nymphs withal <eos> but while herein i took my chief delight <eos> i saw ( alas !) the gaping earth devour <eos> the spring , the place , and all clean out of sight <eos> which yet aggrieves my heart unto this hour <eos> at last , so fair a lady did i spy <eos> that thinking yet on her i burn and quake <eos> on herbs and flowers she walked pensively <eos> a stinging serpent by the heel her caught <eos> wherewith she languished as the gathered flower <eos>
the swift assailants still no fire return <eos> but , tow'rd the batteries that above them burn <eos> climb hard from crag to crag ; and scaling higher <eos> they pierce the long dense canopy of fire <eos> that sheeted all the sky ; then rush amain <eos> storm every outwork , each dread summit gain <eos> hew timber 'd gates , the sullen drawbridge fall <eos> file thro and form within the sounding wall <eos> the britons strike their flag , the fort forgo <eos> descend sad prisoners to the plain below <eos> a thousand veterans , ere the morning rose <eos> received their handcuffs from five hundred foes <eos> and stonypoint beheld , with dawning day <eos> his own starr 'd standard on his rampart play <eos>
some time ago from rome , in smart array <eos> a younger brother homeward bent his way <eos> not much improved , as frequently the case <eos> with those who travel to that famous place <eos> upon the road oft finding , where he stayed <eos> delightful wines , and handsome belle or maid <eos> with careless ease he loitered up and down <eos> one day there passed him in a country town <eos> attended by a page , a lady fair <eos> whose charming form and all engaging air <eos> at once his bosom fired with fond desire <eos> and nearer still , her beauties to admire <eos> he most gallantly saw her safely home <eos> attentions charm the sex where'er we roam <eos>
then with a mighty voice cried out that fiend <eos> weighed down with torments , and this word he spake <eos> “ long time , o andrew , hast thou been well versed <eos> in arts of sorcery ; thou hast deceived <eos> and led astray much people ; but thou shalt <eos> no longer now have power upon such works <eos> for grievous torments are decreed for thee <eos> according to thy deeds . with weary heart <eos> joyless , degraded , thou shalt suffer woes <eos> the bitter pangs of death . my warriors <eos> are ready for the battle ; they will soon <eos> deprive thee of thy life by valiant deeds <eos> what man on earth so mighty that he may <eos> release thee from thy bonds , if i oppose <eos>
then i again inquir 'd : “ where flow the streams <eos> of phlegethon and lethe ? for of one <eos> thou tell'st not , and the other of that shower <eos> thou say'st , is form 'd . ” he answer thus return 'd <eos> “ doubtless thy questions all well pleas 'd i hear <eos> yet the red seething wave might have resolv 'd <eos> one thou proposest . lethe thou shalt see <eos> but not within this hollow , in the place <eos> whither to lave themselves the spirits go <eos> whose blame hath been by penitence remov 'd <eos> he added : “ time is now we quit the wood <eos> look thou my steps pursue : the margins give <eos> safe passage , unimpeded by the flames <eos> for over them all vapour is extinct <eos>
sweet cytherea , sitting by a brook <eos> with young adonis , lovely , fresh , and green <eos> did court the lad with many a lovely look <eos> such looks as none could look but beauty 's queen <eos> she told him stories to delight his ear <eos> she show 'd him favours to allure his eye <eos> to win his heart , she touch 'd him here and there <eos> touches so soft still conquer chastity <eos> but whether unripe years did want conceit <eos> or he refus 'd to take her figur 'd proffer <eos> the tender nibbler would not touch the bait <eos> but smile and jest at every gentle offer <eos> then fell she on her back , fair queen , and toward <eos> he rose and ran away ; ah , fool too froward <eos>
“ so speaking , from the ruddy orient shone <eos> the morn , conspicuous on her golden throne <eos> the goddess with a radiant tunic dress 'd <eos> my limbs , and o'er me cast a silken vest <eos> long flowing robes , of purest white , array <eos> the nymph , that added lustre to the day <eos> a tiar wreath 'd her head with many a fold <eos> her waist was circled with a zone of gold <eos> forth issuing then , from place to place i flew <eos> rouse man by man , and animate my crew <eos> ‘ rise , rise , my mates ! ‘ tis circe gives command <eos> our journey calls us ; haste , and quit the land <eos> all rise and follow , yet depart not all <eos> for fate decreed one wretched man to fall <eos>
the prioress , this secret to disclose <eos> appeared with spectacles upon her nose <eos> and twenty nuns around a dress displayed <eos> that convent mantua makers never made <eos> imagine to yourself what felt the youth <eos> ‘ mid this examination of the truth <eos> the nice proportions and the lily charms <eos> soon raised within his bosom dire alarms <eos> like magick operated on the string <eos> and from it , what was tied , soon gave a spring <eos> broke loose at once , just like a mettled steed <eos> that , having slipt its halter , flies with speed <eos> against the abbess ’ nose with force it flew <eos> and spectacles from her proboscis threw <eos>
thou poetess ! that harpest to the moon <eos> and , in soft concert to the silver tune <eos> of waters , play 'd on by the magic wind <eos> as he comes streaming , with his hair untwined <eos> dost sing light strains of melody and mirth <eos> i hear thee , hymning on thy holy birth <eos> how thou wert moulded of thy mother love <eos> that came , like seraph , from the stars above <eos> and was so sadly wedded unto sin <eos> that thou wert born , and sorrow was thy twin <eos> sorrow and mirthful lunacy ! that be <eos> together link 'd for time , i deem of ye <eos> that ye are worshipp 'd as none others are <eos> one as a lonely shadow , one a star <eos>
the grecian muse has all their gods survived <eos> nor jove at us , nor phoebus is arrived <eos> frail deities ! which first the poets made <eos> and then invoked , to give their fancies aid <eos> yet if they still divert us with their rage <eos> what may be hoped for in a better age <eos> when not from helicon 's imagined spring <eos> but sacred writ , we borrow what we sing <eos> this with the fabric of the world begun <eos> elder than light , and shall outlast the sun <eos> before this oracle , like dagon , all <eos> the false pretenders , delphos , ammon , fall <eos> long since despised and silent , they afford <eos> honour and triumph to th'eternal word <eos>
me doubt possess 'd , and “ speak , ” it whisper 'd me <eos> “ speak , speak unto thy lady , that she quench <eos> thy thirst with drops of sweetness . ” yet blank awe <eos> which lords it o'er me , even at the sound <eos> of beatrice 's name , did bow me down <eos> as one in slumber held . not long that mood <eos> beatrice suffer 'd : she , with such a smile <eos> as might have made one blest amid the flames <eos> beaming upon me , thus her words began <eos> “ thou in thy thought art pond'ring ( as i deem <eos> and what i deem is truth how just revenge <eos> could be with justice punish 'd : from which doubt <eos> i soon will free thee ; so thou mark my words <eos> for they of weighty matter shall possess thee <eos>
oh ! my black soul ! now thou art summoned <eos> by sickness , death 's herald and champion <eos> thou ‘ rt like a pilgrim which abroad hath done <eos> treason , and durst not turn to whence he is fled <eos> or like a thief , which , till death 's doom be read <eos> wisheth himself delivered from prison <eos> but damn 'd , and haul 'd to execution <eos> wisheth that still he might be imprisoned <eos> yet grace , if thou repent , thou canst not lack <eos> but who shall give thee that grace to begin <eos> oh ! make thyself with holy mourning black <eos> and red with blushing , as thou art with sin <eos> or wash thee in christ 's blood , which hath this might <eos> that , being red , it dyes red souls to white <eos>
returning from its daily quest , my spirit <eos> changed thoughts and vile in thee doth weep to find <eos> it grieves me that thy mild and gentle mind <eos> those ample virtues which it did inherit <eos> has lost . once thou didst loathe the multitude <eos> of blind and madding men — i then loved thee <eos> i loved thy lofty songs and that sweet mood <eos> when thou wert faithful to thyself and me <eos> i dare not now through thy degraded state <eos> own the delight thy strains inspire — in vain <eos> i seek what once thou wert — we cannot meet <eos> and we were wont . again and yet again <eos> ponder my words : so the false spirit shall fly <eos> and leave to thee thy true integrity <eos>
fayre is my love , when her fayre golden haires <eos> with the loose wynd ye waving chance to marke <eos> fayre , when the rose in her red cheekes appeares <eos> or in her eyes the fyre of love does sparke <eos> fayre , when her brest , lyke a rich laden barke <eos> with pretious merchandize she forth doth lay <eos> fayre , when that cloud of pryde , which oft doth dark <eos> her goodly light , with smiles she drives away <eos> but fayrest she , when so she doth display <eos> the gate with pearles and rubyes richly dight <eos> throgh which her words so wise do make their way <eos> to beare the message of her gentle spright <eos> the rest be works of natures wonderment <eos> but this the worke of harts astonishment <eos>
already , if my mem'ry do not fail <eos> i 've said , the youth 's estates were put to sale <eos> to pay for feasts the fair to entertain <eos> and what he 'd left was only one domain <eos> a petty farm to which he now retired <eos> ashamed to show where once so much admired <eos> and wretched too , a prey to lorn despair <eos> unable to obtain by splendid care <eos> a beauty he 'd pursued six years and more <eos> and should for ever fervently adore <eos> his want of merit was the cause he thought <eos> that she could never to his wish be brought <eos> while from him not a syllable was heard <eos> against the lovely belle his soul preferred <eos>
little miss baster , of sunnyside <eos> was known as a taster , far and wide <eos> picking and licking , spying and prying <eos> each bottle and dish with her fingers trying <eos> dangerous practice ! dreadful little fact is <eos> once almost poisoned , and very near dying <eos> little miss baster , of sunnyside <eos> has got some poison in paper tied <eos> harmless she deems it , yes , she must taste <eos> like sugar seems it , ah ! but ‘ tis paste <eos> rat'shyppphenbane , the mixture . oh ! woe the day <eos> run for the doctor , bid him not stay <eos> dreadful her anguish — nearly she died <eos> did little miss baster , of sunnyside <eos>
“ no drop shall touch me , by almighty jove <eos> the first and greatest of the gods above <eos> till on the pyre i place thee ; till i rear <eos> the grassy mound , and clip thy sacred hair <eos> some ease at least those pious rites may give <eos> and soothe my sorrows , while i bear to live <eos> howe ’ er , reluctant as i am , i stay <eos> and share your feast ; but with the dawn of day <eos> ( o king of men !) it claims thy royal care <eos> that greece the warrior ’ s funeral pile prepare <eos> and bid the forests fall : ( such rites are paid <eos> to heroes slumbering in eternal shade <eos> then , when his earthly part shall mount in fire <eos> let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire <eos>
louder and louder still the awful roar <eos> pealed from the heights , and shook the frightened shore <eos> thick clouds of smoke enveloped friend and foe <eos> the volleyed thunder shook the depths below <eos> mountain and echoing forest joined the cry <eos> and distant hills gave back the same reply <eos> with animating voice and waving hand <eos> the british leader cheered his gallant band <eos> pressed firmly forward where one endless tide <eos> of woe and carnage reigned on every side <eos> where streams of blood in crimson torrents rolled <eos> where death smote down alike the young and old <eos> and where the thickest poured the deadly shot <eos> the gallant wolfe with daring valor fought <eos>
him thus inactive , with an ardent look <eos> the prince beheld , and high resenting spoke <eos> “ thy hate to troy , is this the time to show <eos> ( o wretch ill fated , and thy country ’ s foe <eos> paris and greece against us both conspire <eos> thy close resentment , and their vengeful ire <eos> for thee great ilion ’ s guardian heroes fall <eos> till heaps of dead alone defend her wall <eos> for thee the soldier bleeds , the matron mourns <eos> and wasteful war in all its fury burns <eos> ungrateful man ! deserves not this thy care <eos> our troops to hearten , and our toils to share <eos> rise , or behold the conquering flames ascend <eos> and all the phrygian glories at an end <eos>
since i did leave the presence of my love <eos> many long weary dayes i have outworne <eos> and many nights , that slowly seemd to move <eos> theyr sad protract from evening untill morn <eos> for , when as day the heaven doth adorne <eos> i wish that night the noyous day would end <eos> and when as night hath us of light forlorne <eos> i wish that day would shortly reascend <eos> thus i the time with expectation spend <eos> and faine my griefe with chaunges to beguile <eos> that further seemes his terme still to extend <eos> and maketh every minute seem a myle <eos> so sorrowe still doth seem too long to last <eos> but ioyous houres do fly away too fast <eos>
but there was more . a jay with skyblue shaft <eos> set in blunt wing , skimmed screaming on ahead <eos> she followed him . a murrey squirrel eyed <eos> her warily , cocked upon tail plumed haunch <eos> then , skipping the whirligig of last year leaves <eos> whisked himself out of sight and reappeared <eos> leering about the hole of a young beech <eos> and every time she thought to corner him <eos> he scrambled round on little scratchy hands <eos> to peek at her about the other side <eos> she lost him , bolting branch to branch , at last <eos> the impudent brat ! but still high overhead <eos> flight on exuberant flight of opal scud <eos> or of dissolving mist , florid as flame <eos>
all woes of all men sat upon thy soul <eos> and all their wrongs were heavy on thy head <eos> with all their wounds thy heart was pierced and bled <eos> and in thy spirit as in a mourning scroll <eos> the world 's huge sorrows were inscribed by roll <eos> all theirs on earth who serve and faint for bread <eos> all banished men 's , all theirs in prison dead <eos> thy love had heart and sword hand for the whole <eos> “ this was my day of glory , ” didst thou say <eos> when , by the scaffold thou hadst hope to climb <eos> for thy faith 's sake , they brought thee respite ; “ nay <eos> i shall not die then , i have missed my day <eos> o hero , o our help , o head sublime <eos> thy day shall be commensurate with time <eos>
whilst i alone did call upon thy aid <eos> my verse alone had all thy gentle grace <eos> but now my gracious numbers are decayed <eos> and my sick muse doth give an other place <eos> i grant ( sweet love ) thy lovely argument <eos> deserves the travail of a worthier pen <eos> yet what of thee thy poet doth invent <eos> he robs thee of , and pays it thee again <eos> he lends thee virtue , and he stole that word <eos> from thy behaviour , beauty doth he give <eos> and found it in thy cheek : he can afford <eos> no praise to thee , but what in thee doth live <eos> then thank him not for that which he doth say <eos> since what he owes thee , thou thy self dost pay <eos>
which are the clouds , and which the mountains ? see <eos> they mix and melt together ! yon blue hill <eos> looks fleeting as the vapors which distill <eos> their dews upon its summit , while the free <eos> and far off clouds , now solid , dark , and still <eos> an aspect wear of calm eternity <eos> each seems the other , as our fancies will <eos> the cloud a mount , the mount a cloud , and we <eos> gaze doubtfully . so everywhere on earth <eos> this foothold where we stand with slipping feet <eos> the unsubstantial and substantial meet <eos> and we are fooled until made wise by time <eos> is not the obvious lesson something worth <eos> lady ? or have i wov'n an idle rhyme <eos>

well , honest john , how fare you now at home <eos> the spring is come , and birds are building nests <eos> the old cock robin to the stye is come <eos> with olive feathers and its ruddy breast <eos> and the old cock , with wattles and red comb <eos> struts with the hens , and seems to like some best <eos> then crows , and looks about for little crumbs <eos> swept out by little folks an hour ago <eos> the pigs sleep in the stye ; the bookman comes <eos> the little boy lets home close nesting go <eos> and pockets tops and taws , where daisies bloom <eos> to look at the new number just laid down <eos> with lots of pictures , and good stories too <eos> and jack the giant killer 's high renown <eos>
— on all the desolations he hath wrought <eos> — on all the passioned hatreds he hath taught <eos> — on all thy great hopes he hath brought to nought <eos> — man rending man with ruthless bitterness <eos> — blasting thine image into nothingness <eos> — hounding thy innocents to awful deaths <eos> and worse than deaths ! happy the dead , who sped <eos> before the torturers their lust had fed <eos> — on thy christ crucified afresh each day <eos> — on all the horrors of war 's grim red way <eos> and ever , in thy solemn midnight skies <eos> those myriad , sleepless , vast accusing eyes <eos> watching , watching , watching all below <eos> and man in all his wilfulness for woe <eos>
tonight a shimmer of gold lies mantled o'er <eos> smooth lovely ocean . through the lustrous gloom <eos> a savor steals from linden trees in bloom <eos> and gardens ranged at many a palace door <eos> proud walls rise here , and , where the moonbeams pour <eos> their pale enchantment down the dim coast line <eos> terrace and lawn , trim hedge and flowering vine <eos> crown with fair culture all the sounding shore <eos> how sweet , to such a place , on such a night <eos> from halls with beauty and festival a glare <eos> to come distract and , stretched on the cool turf <eos> yield to some fond , improbable delight <eos> while the moon , reddening , sinks , and all the air <eos> sighs with the muffled tumult of the surf <eos>
‘ one caution yet is needful to be told <eos> to guide your choice : this wife must not be old <eos> there goes a saying , and ‘ twas shrewdly said <eos> old fish at table , but young flesh in bed <eos> my soul abhors the tasteless dry embrace <eos> of a stale virgin with a winter face <eos> in that cold season love but treats his guest <eos> with beanstraw , and tough forage at the best <eos> no crafty widows shall approach my bed <eos> those are too wise for bachelors to wed <eos> as subtle clerks by many schools are made <eos> twice married dames are mistresses o ’ th ’ trade <eos> but young and tender virgins , ruled with ease <eos> we form like wax , and mould them as we please <eos>
o wholesome death , thy sombre funeral car <eos> looms ever dimly on the lengthening way <eos> of life ; while , lengthening still , in sad array <eos> my deeds in long procession go , that are <eos> as mourners of the man they helped to mar <eos> i see it all in dreams , such as waylay <eos> the wandering fancy when the solid day <eos> has fallen in smoldering ruins , and night 's star <eos> aloft there , with its steady point of light <eos> mastering the eye , has wrapped the brain in sleep <eos> ah , when i die , and planets hold their flight <eos> above my grave , still let my spirit keep <eos> sometimes its vigil of divine remorse <eos> ‘ midst pity , praise , or blame heaped o'er my corse <eos>
toothpick in his boot , so , comparatively speaking <eos> he rode all unarmed , and he rode all alone <eos> because there was no one going his way <eos> he stayed not for brake , and he stopped not for <eos> toll gates ; he swam the eske river where ford <eos> there was none , and saved fifteen cents <eos> in ferriage , but lost his pocket book , containing <eos> seventeen dollars and a half , by the operation <eos> ere he alighted at the netherby mansion <eos> he stopped to borrow a dry suit of clothes <eos> and this delayed him considerably , so when <eos> he arrived the bride had consented — the gallant <eos> came late — for a laggard in love and a dastard in war <eos> was to wed the fair ellen , and the guests had assembled <eos>
at threescore years and five aroused anew <eos> to rule in india , forth a soldier went <eos> on whose bright fronted youth fierce war had spent <eos> its iron stress of storm , till glory grew <eos> full as the red sun waned on waterloo <eos> landing , he met the word from england sent <eos> which bade him yield up rule : and he , content <eos> resigned it , as a mightier warrior 's due <eos> and wrote as one rejoicing to record <eos> that “ from the first ” his royal heart was lord <eos> of its own pride or pain ; that thought was none <eos> therein save this , that in her perilous strait <eos> england , whose womb brings forth her sons so great <eos> should choose to serve her first her mightiest son <eos>
ah pale and dying infant of the spring <eos> how rightly now do i resemble thee <eos> that selfsame hand that thee from stalk did wring <eos> hath rent my breast and robbed my heart from me <eos> yet shalt thou live . for why ? thy native vigour <eos> shall thrive by woeful dew drops of my dolor <eos> and from the wounds i bear through fancy 's rigour <eos> my streaming blood shall yield the crimson color <eos> the ravished sighs that ceaseless take their issue <eos> from out the furnace of my heart inflamed <eos> to yield you lasting springs shall never miss you <eos> so by my plaints and pains , you shall be famed <eos> let my heart 's heat and cold , thy crimson nourish <eos> and by my sorrows let thy beauty flourish <eos>
“ arise , depart , for this is not your rest <eos> oh , burden of all burdens ,— still to arise <eos> and still depart , nor rest in any wise <eos> rolling , still rolling thus to east from west <eos> earth journeys on her immemorial quest <eos> whom a moon chases in no different guise <eos> thus stars pursue their courses , and thus flies <eos> the sun , and thus all creatures manifest <eos> unrest , the common heritage , the ban <eos> flung broadcast on all humankind ,— on all <eos> who live ; for living , all are bound to die <eos> that which is old , we know that it is man <eos> these have no rest who sit and dream and sigh <eos> nor have those rest who wrestle and who fall <eos>
in an idle hour i thought of former days <eos> and former friends seemed to be standing in the room <eos> and then i wondered “ where are they now <eos> like fallen leaves they have tumbled to the nether springs <eos> han y ü[ 1 ] swallowed his sulphur pills <eos> yet a single illness carried him straight to the grave <eos> y ü an ch ē n smelted autumn stone <eos> but before he was old , his strength crumbled away <eos> master tu possessed the “ secret of health <eos> all day long he fasted from meat and spice <eos> the lord ts ‘ ui , trusting a strong drug <eos> through the whole winter wore his summer coat <eos> yet some by illness and some by sudden death <eos> all vanished ere their middle years were passed <eos>
not marble , nor the gilded monuments <eos> of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme <eos> but you shall shine more bright in these contents <eos> than unswept stone , besmeared with sluttish time <eos> when wasteful war shall statues overturn <eos> and broils root out the work of masonry <eos> nor mars his sword , nor war 's quick fire shall burn <eos> the living record of your memory <eos> ‘ gainst death , and all oblivious enmity <eos> shall you pace forth , your praise shall still find room <eos> even in the eyes of all posterity <eos> that wear this world out to the ending doom <eos> so till the judgment that your self arise <eos> you live in this , and dwell in lovers ’ eyes <eos>
as now the perfum 'd lamps stream wide their light <eos> and social converse chears the livelong night <eos> thus spake zorobabel , “ too long in vain <eos> “ for sion desolate her sons complain <eos> “ in anguish worn the joyless years lag slow <eos> “ and these proud conquerors mock their captive 's woe <eos> “ whilst cyrus triumph 'd here in victor state <eos> “ a brighter prospect chear 'd our exil 'd fate <eos> “ our sacred walls again he bade us raise <eos> “ and to jehovah rear the pile of praise <eos> “ quickly these fond hopes faded from our eyes <eos> “ as the frail sun that gilds the wintry skies <eos> “ and spreads a moment 's radiance o'er the plain <eos> “ soon hid by clouds that dim the scene again <eos>
yet , lady , no — for song so rude as mine <eos> chase not the wonders of your art divine <eos> still , radiant eye , upon the canvas dwell <eos> still , magic finger , weave your potent spell <eos> and , while i sing the animated smiles <eos> of fairy nature in these sun born isles <eos> oh , might the song awake some bright design <eos> inspire a touch , or prompt one happy line <eos> proud were my soul , to see its humble thought <eos> on painting 's mirror so divinely caught <eos> while wondering genius , as he leaned to trace <eos> the faint conception kindling into grace <eos> might love my numbers for the spark they threw <eos> and bless the lay that lent a charm to you <eos>
i live , sweet love , whereas the gentle wind <eos> murmurs with sport in midst of thickest boughs <eos> where loving woodbine doth the harbor bind <eos> and chirping birds do echo forth my vows <eos> where strongest elm can scarce support the vine <eos> and sweetest flowers enameled have the ground <eos> where muses dwell ; and yet hereat repine <eos> that on the earth so rare a place was found <eos> but winds delight , i wish to be content <eos> i praise the woodbine , but i take no joy <eos> i moan the birds that music thus have spent <eos> as for the rest , they breed but mine annoy <eos> live then , fair licia , in this place alone <eos> then shall i joy though all of these were gone <eos>
read here the story of evarra — man <eos> maker of gods in lands beyond the sea <eos> because the city had no wealth to give <eos> because the caravans were spoiled afar <eos> because his life was threatened by the king <eos> so that all men despised him in the streets <eos> he hewed the living rock , with sweat and tears <eos> and reared a god against the morning gold <eos> a terror in the sunshine , seen afar <eos> and worshipped by the king ; but , drunk with pride <eos> because the city fawned to bring him back <eos> he carved upon the plinth : “ thus gods are made <eos> and whoso makes them otherwise shall die <eos> and all the people praised him . . . . then he died <eos>
when my abodes prefixed time is spent <eos> my cruell fayre streight bids me wend my way <eos> but then from heaven most hideous stormes are sent <eos> as willing me against her will to stay <eos> whom then shall i — or heaven , or her — obay <eos> the heavens know best what is the best for me <eos> but as she will , whose will my life doth sway <eos> my lower heaven , so it perforce must be <eos> but ye high hevens , that all this sorowe see <eos> sith all your tempests cannot hold me backe <eos> aswage your storms , or else both you and she <eos> will both together me too sorely wrack <eos> enough it is for one man to sustaine <eos> the stormes which she alone on me doth raine <eos>
dame fortune often loves a laugh to raise <eos> and , playing off her tricks and roguish ways <eos> instead of giving us what we desire <eos> mere quid pro quo permits us to acquire <eos> i 've found her gambols such from first to last <eos> and judge the future by experience past <eos> fair cloris and myself felt mutual flame <eos> and , when a year had run , the sprightly dame <eos> prepared to grant me , if i may be plain <eos> some slight concessions that would ease my pain <eos> this was her aim ; but whatsoe'er in view <eos> ‘ tis opportunity we should pursue <eos> the lover , who 's discreet , will moments seize <eos> and ev'ry effort then will tend to please <eos>
to love and to remember ; that is good <eos> to love and to forget ; that is not well <eos> to lapse from love to hatred ; that is hell <eos> and death and torment , rightly understood <eos> soul dazed by love and sorrow , cheer thy mood <eos> more blest art thou than mortal tongue can tell <eos> ring not thy funeral but thy marriage bell <eos> and salt with hope thy life 's insipid food <eos> love is the goal , love is the way we wend <eos> love is our parallel unending line <eos> whose only perfect parallel is christ <eos> beginning not begun , end without end <eos> for he who hath the heart of god sufficed <eos> can satisfy all hearts ,— yea , thine and mine <eos>
peace hath an altar there . the sounding feet <eos> of thunder and the ‘ wildering wings of rain <eos> against fire rifted summits flash and beat <eos> and through grey upper gorges swoop and strain <eos> but round that hallowed mountain spring remain <eos> year after year , the days of tender heat <eos> and gracious nights , whose lips with flowers are sweet <eos> and filtered lights , and lutes of soft refrain <eos> a still , bright pool . to men i may not tell <eos> the secret that its heart of water knows <eos> the story of a loved and lost repose <eos> yet this i say to cliff and close leaved dell <eos> a fitful spirit haunts yon limpid well <eos> whose likeness is the faithless face of rose <eos>
o thou ! whose steps in sacred reverence tread <eos> these lone dominions of the silent dead <eos> on this sad stone a pious look bestow <eos> nor uninstructed read this tale of woe <eos> and while the sigh of sorrow heaves thy breast <eos> let each rebellious murmur be suppress 'd <eos> heaven 's hidden ways to trace , for us how vain <eos> heaven 's wise decrees , how impious to arraign <eos> pure from the stains of a polluted age <eos> in early bloom of life they left the stage <eos> not doom 'd in lingering woe to waste their breath <eos> one moment snatch 'd them from the power of death <eos> they lived united , and united died <eos> happy the friends whom death cannot divide <eos>
yet why , you ask , these humble crimes relate <eos> why make the poor as guilty as the great <eos> to show the great , those mightier sons of pride <eos> how near in vice the lowest are allied <eos> such are their natures and their passions such <eos> but these disguise too little , those too much <eos> so shall the man of power and pleasure see <eos> in his own slave as vile a wretch as he <eos> in his luxurious lord the servant find <eos> his own low pleasures and degenerate mind <eos> and each in all the kindred vices trace <eos> of a poor , blind , bewildered , erring race <eos> who , a short time in varied fortune past <eos> die , and are equal in the dust at last <eos>
upon a rock , high on a mountain side <eos> thousands of feet above the lake sea 's lip <eos> a rock in which old waters ’ rise and dip <eos> plunge and recoil , and backward eddying tide <eos> had , age long , worn , while races lived and died <eos> involved channels , where the sea weed 's drip <eos> followed the ebb ; and now earth grasses sip <eos> fresh dews from heaven , whereby on earth they bide <eos> i sat and gazed southwards . a dry flow <eos> of withering wind blew on my drooping strength <eos> from o'er the awful desert 's burning length <eos> behind me piled , away and upward go <eos> great sweeps of savage mountains — up , away <eos> where panthers roam , and snow gleams all the day <eos>
by day she woos me , soft , exceeding fair <eos> but all night as the moon so changeth she <eos> loathsome and foul with hideous leprosy <eos> and subtle serpents gliding in her hair <eos> by day she woos me to the outer air <eos> ripe fruits , sweet flowers , and full satiety <eos> but through the night , a beast she grins at me <eos> a very monster void of love and prayer <eos> by day she stands a lie : by night she stands <eos> in all the naked horror of the truth <eos> with pushing horns and clawed and clutching hands <eos> is this a friend indeed ; that i should sell <eos> my soul to her , give her my life and youth <eos> till my feet , cloven too , take hold on hell <eos>
— yet , when at last , in deep repose he lay <eos> his classic features , and unfurrow 'd brow <eos> wearing the symmetry of earlier days <eos> which death , as if relenting , render 'd back <eos> in transitory gleam , ‘ twas sweet to hear <eos> his aged pastor at the coffin side <eos> bearing full tribute to his piety <eos> so many lustrums , that consistent faith <eos> which nerv 'd his journey and had led him home <eos> home ?— yes ! give thanks , ye , who still travel on <eos> oft startled , as some pilgrim from your side <eos> falls through the arches of time 's broken bridge <eos> without a warning , and is seen no more <eos> give thanks that he is safe ,— at home ,— in heaven <eos>
angel of thought , meseems god winged thee so <eos> and crowned thine head with passion fine as flame <eos> and made thy lifted face too pure for shame <eos> with eyes and brow a mirror to his glow <eos> and gave thy lips a golden trump , that , though <eos> long years have passed since other angels came <eos> to work the mighty wonders of his name <eos> in god 's own name and man 's , thyself shalt go <eos> forever on strong pinions to and fro <eos> and round the earth reverberating blow <eos> the mute , world shaking music of the mind <eos> that thou might'st make as naught all space and time <eos> and thrill in mystic oneness through mankind <eos> yet dwell in each , inviolate , sublime <eos>
oh , modest maiden morn ! why dost thou blush <eos> who thus betimes art walking in the sky <eos> ‘ tis i , whose cheek bears pleasure 's sleepless flush <eos> who shame to meet thy gray , cloud lidded eye <eos> shadowy , yet clear : from the bright eastern door <eos> where the sun 's shafts lie bound with thongs of fire <eos> along the heaven 's amber paved floor <eos> the glad hours move , hymning their early choir <eos> o , fair and fragrant morn ! upon my brow <eos> press thy fresh lips , shake from thy dropping hair <eos> cold showers of balmy dew on me , and ere <eos> day 's chariot wheels upon th ’ horizon glow <eos> wrap me within thy sober cloak of gray <eos> and bear me to thy twilight bowers away <eos>
the husband quite astonished now appeared <eos> at once a hundred diff'rent ills he feared <eos> but questioning his wife howe'er , he found <eos> that many other dames who lived around <eos> like her ; in paying tithes , the monks obeyed <eos> which consolation to his breast conveyed <eos> poor innocent ! she nothing wished to hide <eos> said she , not one but tithe they make provide <eos> good friar aubrey takes your sister 's dues <eos> to father fabry mrs. b 's accrues <eos> the mayoress friar william likes to greet <eos> a monk more handsome scarcely you will meet <eos> and i to friar gerard always go <eos> i wished this night to pay him all i owe <eos>
full many a glorious morning have i seen <eos> flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye <eos> kissing with golden face the meadows green <eos> gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy <eos> anon permit the basest clouds to ride <eos> with ugly rack on his celestial face <eos> and from the forlorn world his visage hide <eos> stealing unseen to west with this disgrace <eos> even so my sun one early morn did shine <eos> with all triumphant splendour on my brow <eos> but out alack , he was but one hour mine <eos> the region cloud hath masked him from me now <eos> yet him for this , my love no whit disdaineth <eos> suns of the world may stain , when heaven 's sun staineth <eos>
more she had spoke , but yawn 'd — all nature nods <eos> what mortal can resist the yawn of gods <eos> churches and chapels instantly it reach 'd <eos> ( st james 's first , for leaden gilbert <eos> then catch 'd the schools ; the hall scarce kept awake <eos> the convocation gaped , but could not speak <eos> lost was the nation 's sense , nor could be found <eos> while the long solemn unison went round <eos> wide , and more wide , it spread o'er all the realm <eos> even palinurus nodded at the helm <eos> the vapour mild o'er each committee crept <eos> unfinish 'd treaties in each office slept <eos> and chiefless armies dozed out the campaign <eos> and navies yawn 'd for orders on the main <eos>
the bravest of th ’ aetolians , periphas <eos> ochesius ’ stalwart son , he just had slain <eos> and stood in act to strip him of his arms <eos> the helmet then of darkness pallas donn 'd <eos> to hide her presence from the sight of mars <eos> but when the blood stain 'd god of war beheld <eos> advancing tow'rd him godlike diomed <eos> the corpse of stalwart periphas he left <eos> there where he fell , to lie ; while he himself <eos> of valiant diomed th ’ encounter met <eos> when near they came , first mars his pond'rous spear <eos> advane 'd beyond the yoke and horses ’ reins <eos> with murd'rous aim ; but pallas from the car <eos> turn 'd it aside , and foil 'd the vain attempt <eos>
not love of you is most that i can bring <eos> since what i am to love you is the test <eos> and should i love you more than any thing <eos> you would but be of idle love possessed <eos> a mere love wandering in appetite <eos> counting your glories and yet bringing none <eos> finding in you occasions of delight <eos> a thief of payment for no service done <eos> but when of labouring life i make a song <eos> and bring it you , as that were my reward <eos> to let what most is me to you belong <eos> then do i come of high possessions lord <eos> and loving life more than my love of you <eos> i give you love more excellently true <eos>
“ thus having pass 'd the night in fruitless pain <eos> i to my longing friends return again <eos> amaz 'd th ’ augmented number to behold <eos> of men and matrons mix 'd , of young and old <eos> a wretched exil 'd crew together brought <eos> with arms appointed , and with treasure fraught <eos> resolv 'd , and willing , under my command <eos> to run all hazards both of sea and land <eos> the morn began , from ida , to display <eos> her rosy cheeks ; and phosphor led the day <eos> before the gates the grecians took their post <eos> and all pretense of late relief was lost <eos> i yield to fate , unwillingly retire <eos> and , loaded , up the hill convey my sire <eos>
thus labour 'd thro ’ the night the long hair 'd greeks <eos> the gods , assembled in the courts of jove <eos> with wonder view 'd the mighty work ; and thus <eos> neptune , earth shaking king , his speech began <eos> “ o father jove , in all the wide spread earth <eos> shall men be found , in counsel and design <eos> to rival us immortals ? see'st thou not <eos> how round their ships the long hair 'd greeks have built <eos> a lofty wall , and dug a trench around <eos> nor to the gods have paid their off'rings due <eos> wide as the light extends shall be the fame <eos> of this great work , and men shall lightly deem <eos> of that which i and phoebus jointly rais 'd <eos> with toil and pain , for great laomedon <eos>
and should the twilight darken into night <eos> and sorrow grow to anguish , be thou strong <eos> thou art in god , and nothing can go wrong <eos> which a fresh life pulse cannot set aright <eos> that thou dost know the darkness , proves the light <eos> weep if thou wilt , but weep not all too long <eos> or weep and work , for work will lead to song <eos> but search thy heart , if , hid from all thy sight <eos> there lies no cause for beauty 's slow decay <eos> if for completeness and diviner youth <eos> and not for very love , thou seek'st the truth <eos> if thou hast learned to give thyself away <eos> for love 's own self , not for thyself , i say <eos> were god 's love less , the world were lost , in sooth <eos>
so there he paused and calmly closed his eyes <eos> and silently i sat and held his hand <eos> after a time , when we were left alone <eos> he spoke again with calmer voice and said <eos> “ captain , you oft have asked my history <eos> and i as oft refused . there is no cause <eos> why i should longer hold it from my friend <eos> who reads the closing chapter . it may teach <eos> one soul to lean upon the arm of christ <eos> that hope and happiness find anchorage <eos> only in heaven . while my lonesome life <eos> saw death but dimly in the dull distance <eos> my lips were sealed to the unhappy tale <eos> under my pride i hid a heavy heart <eos>
where mexic hills the breezy gulph defend <eos> spontaneous groves with richer burdens bend <eos> anana 's stalk its shaggy honors yields <eos> acassia 's flowers perfume a thousand fields <eos> their cluster 'd dates the mast like palms unfold <eos> the spreading orange waves a load of gold <eos> connubial vines o'ertop the larch they climb <eos> the long lived olive mocks the moth of time <eos> pomona 's pride , that old grenada claims <eos> here smiles and reddens in diviner flames <eos> pimento , citron scent the sky serene <eos> white woolly clusters fringe the cotton 's green <eos> the sturdy fig , the frail deciduous cane <eos> and foodful cocoa fan the sultry plain <eos>
the spark concealed himself ; each charm admired <eos> now this , now that , now t'other feature fired <eos> a hundred beauties caught his eager sight <eos> and while his bosom felt supreme delight <eos> he turned his thoughts advantages to take <eos> and of the maiden 's error something make <eos> assumed the character , and dress ; and air <eos> that should a wat'ry deity declare <eos> within the gliding flood his vestments dipt <eos> a crown of rushes on his head he slipt <eos> aquatick herbs and plants around he twined <eos> then mercury intreated to be kind <eos> and cupid too , the wily god of hearts <eos> how could the innocent resist these arts <eos>
with all our hearts we praise you whom ye hate <eos> high souls that hate us ; for our hopes are higher <eos> and higher than yours the goal of our desire <eos> though high your ends be as your hearts are great <eos> your world of gods and kings , of shrine and state <eos> was of the night when hope and fear stood nigher <eos> wherein men walked by light of stars and fire <eos> till man by day stood equal with his fate <eos> honour not hate we give you , love not fear <eos> last prophets of past kind , who fill the dome <eos> of great dead gods with wrath and wail , nor hear <eos> time 's word and man 's : “ go honoured hence , go home <eos> night 's childless children ; here your hour is done <eos> pass with the stars , and leave us with the sun <eos>
as due by many titles , i resign <eos> myself to thee , o god ! first i was made <eos> by thee , and for thee ; and when i was decayed <eos> thy blood bought that , the which before was thine <eos> i am thy son , made with thyself to shine <eos> thy servant , whose pains thou hast still repaid <eos> thy sheep , thine image ; and , till i betrayed <eos> myself , a temple of thy spirit divine <eos> why doth the devil then usurp on me <eos> why doth he steal , nay , ravish , that 's thy right <eos> except thou rise , and for thine own work fight <eos> oh ! i shall soon despair , when i shall see <eos> that thou lov'st mankind well , yet wilt not choose me <eos> and satan hates me , yet is loth to lose me <eos>
thus far to hold their battlements was all <eos> the greeks had hoped ; now , venturing attack <eos> with glittering torches for their arms , by night <eos> fearless they sallied forth : nor lance they bear <eos> nor deadly bow , nor shaft ; for fire alone <eos> is now their weapon . through the roman works <eos> driven by the wind the conflagration spread <eos> nor did the newness of the wood make pause <eos> the fury of the flames , which , fed afresh <eos> by living torches , ‘ neath a smoky pall <eos> leaped on in fiery tongues . not wood alone <eos> but stones gigantic crumbling into dust <eos> dissolved beneath the heat ; the mighty mound <eos> lay prone , yet in its ruin larger seemed <eos>
master of human destinies am i <eos> fame , love and fortune on my footsteps wait <eos> cities and fields i walk : i penetrate <eos> deserts and fields remote , and , passing by <eos> hovel and mart and palace , soon or late <eos> i knock unbidden once at every gate <eos> if sleeping , wake : if feasting , rise before <eos> i turn away . it is the hour of fate <eos> and they who follow me reach every state <eos> mortals desire , and conquer every foe <eos> save death ; but those who doubt or hesitate <eos> condemned to failure , penury and woe <eos> seek me in vain and uselessly implore <eos> i answer not , and i return no more <eos>
x . cease , then , nor order imperfection name <eos> our proper bliss depends on what we blame <eos> know thy own point : this kind , this due degree <eos> of blindness , weakness , heaven bestows on thee <eos> submit . in this , or any other sphere <eos> secure to be as blest as thou canst bear <eos> safe in the hand of one disposing power <eos> or in the natal , or the mortal hour <eos> all nature is but art , unknown to thee <eos> all chance , direction , which thou canst not see <eos> all discord , harmony not understood <eos> all partial evil , universal good <eos> and , spite of pride in erring reason 's spite <eos> one truth is clear , whatever is , is right <eos>
man , that wast godlike being a child , and now <eos> no less than kinglike , art no more in sooth <eos> for all thy grace and lordliness of youth <eos> the crown that bids men 's branded foreheads bow <eos> much more has branded and bowed down thy brow <eos> and gnawn upon it as with fire or tooth <eos> of steel or snake so sorely , that the truth <eos> seems here to bear false witness . is it thou <eos> child ? and is all the summer of all thy spring <eos> this ? are the smiles that drew men 's kisses down <eos> all faded and transfigured to the frown <eos> that grieves thy face ? art thou this weary thing <eos> then is no slave 's load heavier than a crown <eos> and such a thrall no bondman as a king <eos>
life ! austere arbiter of each man 's fate <eos> by whom he learns that nature 's steadfast laws <eos> are as decrees immutable ; o pause <eos> your even forward march ! not yet too late <eos> teach me the needed lesson , when to wait <eos> inactive as a ship when no wind draws <eos> to stretch the loosened cordage . one implores <eos> thy clemency , whose wilfulness innate <eos> has gone uncurbed and roughshod while the years <eos> have lengthened into decades ; now distressed <eos> he knows no rule by which to move or stay <eos> and teased with restlessness and desperate fears <eos> he dares not watch in silence thy wise way <eos> bringing about results none could have guessed <eos>
the weary mariner so fast not flies <eos> a howling tempest , harbour to attain <eos> nor shepherd hastes , when frays of wolves arise <eos> so fast to fold , to save his bleating train <eos> as i , wing 'd with contempt and just disdain <eos> now fly the world , and what it most doth prize <eos> and sanctuary seek , free to remain <eos> from wounds of abject times , and envy 's eyes <eos> to me this world did once seem sweet and fair <eos> while senses ’ light mind 's prospective kept blind <eos> now , like imagined landscape in the air <eos> and weeping rainbows , her best joys i find <eos> or if aught here is had that praise should have <eos> it is a life obscure , and silent grave <eos>
blame not my heart for flying up so high <eos> sith thou art cause that it this flight begun <eos> for earthly vapours drawn up by the sun <eos> comets become , and night suns in the sky <eos> mine humble heart , so with thy heavenly eye <eos> drawn up aloft , all low desires doth shun <eos> raise thou me up , as thou my heart hast done <eos> so during night in heaven remain may i <eos> i say again , blame not my high desire <eos> sith of us both the cause thereof depends <eos> in thee doth shine , in me doth burn a fire <eos> fire draws up other , and itself ascends <eos> thine eye a fire , and so draws up my love <eos> my love a fire , and so ascends above <eos>

when the first larvae on the elm are seen <eos> the crawling wretches , like its leaves , are green <eos> ere chill october shakes the latest down <eos> they , like the foliage , change their tint to brown <eos> on the blue flower a bluer flower you spy <eos> you stretch to pluck it — ‘ tis a butterfly <eos> the flattened tree toads so resemble bark <eos> they 're hard to find as ethiops in the dark <eos> the woodcock , stiffening to fictitious mud <eos> cheats the young sportsman thirsting for his blood <eos> so by long living on a single lie <eos> nay , on one truth , will creatures get its dye <eos> red , yellow , green , they take their subject 's hue <eos> except when squabbling turns them black and blue <eos>
most strength the moving principle requires <eos> active its task , it prompts , impels , inspires <eos> sedate and quiet the comparing lies <eos> form 'd but to check , deliberate , and advise <eos> self love , still stronger , as its objects nigh <eos> reason 's at distance , and in prospect lie <eos> that sees immediate good by present sense <eos> reason , the future and the consequence <eos> thicker than arguments , temptations throng <eos> at best more watchful this , but that more strong <eos> the action of the stronger to suspend <eos> reason still use , to reason still attend <eos> attention , habit and experience gains <eos> each strengthens reason , and self love restrains <eos>
as are the sands , fair licia , on the shore <eos> or colored flowers , garlands of the spring <eos> or as the frosts not seen , not felt before <eos> or as the fruits that autumn forth doth bring <eos> as twinkling stars , the tinsel of the night <eos> or as the fish that gallop in the seas <eos> as airs each part that still escapes our sight <eos> so are my sighs , controllers of my ease <eos> yet these are such as needs must have an end <eos> for things finite none else hath nature done <eos> only the sighs , which from my heart i send <eos> will never cease , but where they first begun <eos> accept them , sweet , as incense due to thee <eos> for you immortal made them so to be <eos>
a wrinkled , crabb é d man they picture thee <eos> old winter , with a rugged beard as gray <eos> as the long moss upon the apple tree <eos> blue lipt , an ice drop at thy sharp blue nose <eos> close muffled up , and on thy dreary way <eos> plodding alone through sleet and drifting snows <eos> they should have drawn thee by the high heapt hearth <eos> old winter ! seated in thy great armed chair <eos> watching the children at their christmas mirth <eos> or circled by them as thy lips declare <eos> some merry jest , or tale of murder dire <eos> or troubled spirit that disturbs the night <eos> pausing at times to rouse the smouldering fire <eos> or taste the old october brown and bright <eos>
oft do i marvel whether delia 's eyes <eos> are eyes , or else two radiant stars that shine <eos> for how could nature ever thus devise <eos> of earth , on earth , a substance so divine <eos> stars , sure , they are , whose motions rule desires <eos> and calm and tempest follow their aspects <eos> their sweet appearing still such power inspires <eos> that makes the world admire so strange effects <eos> yet whether fixed or wandering stars are they <eos> whose influence rules the orb of my poor heart <eos> fixed , sure , they are , but wandering make me stray <eos> in endless errors whence i cannot part <eos> stars , then , not eyes , move you with milder view <eos> your sweet aspect on him that honours you <eos>
a light wind , from the open casement , fanned <eos> my brow and helen 's , as we , hand in hand <eos> sat looking out upon the twilight scene <eos> in dreamy silence . helen 's dark blue eyes <eos> like two lost stars that wandered from the skies <eos> some night adown the meteor 's shining track <eos> and always had been grieving to go back <eos> now gazed up , wistfully , at heaven 's dome <eos> and seemed to recognise and long for home <eos> her sweet voice broke the silence : “ wish , maurine <eos> before you speak ! you know the moon is new <eos> and anything you wish for will come true <eos> before it wanes . i do believe the sign <eos> now tell me your wish , and i 'll tell you mine <eos>
i might have died before my life begun <eos> whenas my father for his country 's good <eos> the persian 's favor and the sophy won <eos> and yet with danger of his dearest blood <eos> thy father , sweet , whom danger did beset <eos> escap è d all , and for no other end <eos> but only this , that you he might beget <eos> whom heavens decreed into the world to send <eos> then father , thank thy daughter for thy life <eos> and neptune praise that yielded so to thee <eos> to calm the tempest when the storms were rife <eos> and that thy daughter should a venus be <eos> i call thee venus , sweet , but be not wroth <eos> thou art more chaste , yet seas did favor both <eos>

‘ twas a sweet time for nesace — for there <eos> her world lay lolling on the golden air <eos> near four bright suns — a temporary rest <eos> an oasis in desert of the blest <eos> away away — ‘ mid seas of rays that roll <eos> empyrean splendor o'er th ’ unchained soul <eos> the soul that scarce ( the billows are so dense <eos> can struggle to its destin 'd eminence <eos> to distant spheres , from time to time , she rode <eos> and late to ours , the favour 'd one of god <eos> but , now , the ruler of an anchor 'd realm <eos> she throws aside the sceptre — leaves the helm <eos> and , amid incense and high spiritual hymns <eos> laves in quadruple light her angel limbs <eos>
they swept up much , they shovelled up more <eos> there never was such a snow man before <eos> they built him bravely with might and main <eos> there never will be such a snow man again <eos> his legs were big , his body was bigger <eos> they made him a most imposing figure <eos> his eyes were large and as black as coal <eos> for a cinder was placed in each round hole <eos> and the sight of his teeth would have made yours ache <eos> being simply the teeth of an ancient rake <eos> they smoothed his forehead , they patted his back <eos> there was n't a single unsightly crack <eos> and when they had given the final pat <eos> they crowned his head with the scare crow 's hat <eos>
i said i splendidly loved you ; it 's not true <eos> such long swift tides stir not a land locked sea <eos> on gods or fools the high risk falls — on you <eos> the clean clear bitter sweet that 's not for me <eos> love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist <eos> love is flung lucifer like from heaven to hell <eos> but — there are wanderers in the middle mist <eos> who cry for shadows , clutch , and cannot tell <eos> whether they love at all , or , loving , whom <eos> an old song 's lady , a fool in fancy dress <eos> or phantoms , or their own face on the gloom <eos> for love of love , or from heart 's loneliness <eos> pleasure 's not theirs , nor pain . they doubt , and sigh <eos> and do not love at all . of these am i <eos>

the birds sung their sorrows the whole summer long <eos> and the robin first mixed up his ills with his song <eos> he sung of his griefs — how in love he 'd been crossed <eos> and gave up his heart as eternally lost <eos> ‘ t was burnt to a coal , as sly cupid let fall <eos> a spark that scorched through both the feathers and all <eos> to cure it time tried , but ne'er found out the way <eos> so the mark on his bosom he wears to this day <eos> and when birds are all silent , and not a leaf seen <eos> on the trees , but the ivy and holly so green <eos> in frost and in snow little robin will sing <eos> to put off the sorrow that ruffles his wing <eos> and that is the cause in our gardens we hear <eos> the robin 's sweet note at the close of the year <eos>
i 've called you father , praised your royal grace <eos> behind your back as well as to your face <eos> you 've owned i have a conscience : try me now <eos> if i can quit your gifts with cheerful brow <eos> that was a prudent answer which , we 're told <eos> the son of wise ulysses made of old <eos> “ our ithaca is scarce the place for steeds <eos> it has no level plains , no grassy meads <eos> atrides , if you 'll let me , i 'll decline <eos> a gift that better meets your wants than mine <eos> small things become small folks : imperial rome <eos> is all too large , too bustling for a home <eos> the empty heights of tibur , or the bay <eos> of soft tarentum , more are in my way <eos>
yet more than tropic 's soft abundance thralling <eos> my stormy north land wilderness is calling <eos> her snowflake flocks , her gleaming midnight frosts <eos> the glory of grim forests on her coasts <eos> green tinted steppes with distant bluish rim <eos> the trooping clouds in heaven 's spaces dim <eos> unto the heart how the familiar cries <eos> the village mean that in the valley lies <eos> the wealthy cities ’ towering majesty <eos> the empty snow fields ’ endless boundary <eos> the changeful moods that all unbridled throng <eos> spirit of russia and of russian song <eos> with joy now gushing forth ,— with pain now ringing <eos> unto the hearer 's heart resistless singing <eos>
adieu ! dear girl ! if we are doom 'd to part <eos> take with thee , take , the blessing of this heart <eos> due to thy gentle mind , and cultur 'd sense <eos> perhaps ‘ twill please , but , sure , can n't give offence <eos> tho ’ , when we met , the solar ray was gone <eos> and on our steps the moon beam only shone <eos> yet well i mark 'd thy form and native grace <eos> and all the sweet expression of thy face <eos> and pleas 'd i listen 'd as thy accents fell <eos> accents that spoke a feeling mind so well <eos> lo , when the birds repose at ev'ning hour <eos> the sweetest of them carols from her bow'r <eos> so , when the dews the garden 's fragrance close <eos> the night flow'r [ a ] blooms , the rival of the rose <eos>
whilst his redeemer on his canvass dies <eos> stabb ’ d at his feet his brother weltering lies <eos> the daring artist , cruelly serene <eos> views the pale cheek and the distorted mien <eos> he drains off life by drops , and , deaf to cries <eos> examines every spirit as it flies <eos> he studies torment , dives in mortal woe <eos> to rouse up every pang repeats his blow <eos> each rising agony , each dreadful grace <eos> yet warm transplanting to his saviour ’ s face <eos> oh glorious theft ! oh nobly wicked draught <eos> with its full charge of death each feature fraught <eos> such wondrous force the magic colours boast <eos> from his own skill he starts in horror lost <eos>
x . doubtless thine eyes have watched the sun aspire <eos> from that same olivet , when back on thee <eos> flushed upwards after some night agony <eos> thy proper godhead , with a purer fire <eos> purpling thy infinite , and in strong desire <eos> thou sattest in the dawn that was to be <eos> uplifted on our dark perplexity <eos> yea in thee lay thy soul , a living lyre <eos> and each wild beauty smote it , though the sound <eos> rung to the night winds oft and desert air <eos> beneath thine eyes the lily paled more fair <eos> and each still shadow slanting on the ground <eos> lay sweetly on thee as commissioned there <eos> so full wast thou of eyes all round and round <eos>
th ’ adventure charm 'd him , and next morning rose <eos> the sabbath , with its silence and repose <eos> the bells ceas 'd chiming , and the broad blue sky <eos> smil 'd on his peace , and met his tranquil eye <eos> inverted , from the foot bridge on his way <eos> to that still house where all his fathers lay <eos> there in his seat , each neighbour 's face he knew <eos> the stranger girl was just before his pew <eos> he saw her kneel , with meek , but cheerful air <eos> and whisper the response to every prayer <eos> and , when the humble roof with praises rung <eos> he caught the hallelujah from her tongue <eos> rememb'ring with delight the tears that fell <eos> when the poor father bade his child farewell <eos>
as the blind man behind his leader walks <eos> lest he should err , or stumble unawares <eos> on what might harm him , or perhaps destroy <eos> i journey 'd through that bitter air and foul <eos> still list'ning to my escort 's warning voice <eos> “ look that from me thou part not . ” straight i heard <eos> voices , and each one seem 'd to pray for peace <eos> and for compassion , to the lamb of god <eos> that taketh sins away . their prelude still <eos> was “ agnus dei , ” and through all the choir <eos> one voice , one measure ran , that perfect seem 'd <eos> the concord of their song . “ are these i hear <eos> spirits , o master ? ” i exclaim 'd ; and he <eos> “ thou aim'st aright : these loose the bonds of wrath <eos>
far out of bounds he 's figured — in a race <eos> of west end traffic pitching to his loss <eos> but if you 'd see him in his proper place <eos> making the browns for bub and grub and doss <eos> go east among the merchants and their men <eos> and where the press is noisiest , and the tides <eos> of trade run highest and widest , there and then <eos> you shall behold him , edging with equal strides <eos> along the kerb ; hawking in either hand <eos> some artful nothing made of twine and tin <eos> cardboard and foil and bits of rubber band <eos> some penn'orth of wit in fact that , with a grin <eos> the careful city marvels at , and buys <eos> for nurselings in the suburbs to despise <eos>
the other maidens raised their eyes to him <eos> who stumbled in before them when the fight <eos> had left him victor , with a victor 's right <eos> i think his eyes with quick hot tears grew dim <eos> he scarcely saw her swaying white and slim <eos> and trembling slightly , dreaming of his might <eos> nor knew he touched her hand , as strangely light <eos> as a wan wraith 's beside a river 's rim <eos> the other maidens raised their eyes to see <eos> and only she has hid her face away <eos> and yet i ween she loved him more than they <eos> and very fairly fashioned was her face <eos> yet for love 's shame and sweet humility <eos> she dared not meet him with their queenlike grace <eos>
if glorious visions , born for all mankind <eos> the bright auroras of our twilight mind <eos> if fancies , varying as the shapes that lie <eos> stained on the windows of the sunset sky <eos> if hopes , that beckon with delusive gleams <eos> till the eye dances in the void of dreams <eos> if passions , following with the winds that urge <eos> earth 's wildest wanderer to her farthest verge <eos> if these on all some transient hours bestow <eos> of rapture tingling with its hectic glow <eos> then all are poets ; and if earth had rolled <eos> her myriad centuries , and her doom were told <eos> each moaning billow of her shoreless wave <eos> would wail its requiem o'er a poet 's grave <eos>
in the chill silence of the winter eve <eos> thro ’ lichfield 's darken 'd streets i bend my way <eos> by that sad mansion , where nerina 's clay <eos> awaits the morning knell ;— and awed perceive <eos> in the late bridal chamber , the clear ray <eos> of numerous lights ; while o'er the ceiling stray <eos> shadows of those who frequent pass beneath <eos> round the pale dead .— what sounds my senses grieve <eos> for now the busy hammer 's stroke appals <eos> that , “ in dread note of preparation ,” falls <eos> closing the sable lid !— with sighs i bear <eos> these solemn warnings from the house of woes <eos> pondering how late , for young nerina , there <eos> joyous , the love illumin 'd morn arose <eos>
he eats ( a moment 's stoppage to his song <eos> the stolen turnip as he goes along <eos> and hops along and heeds with careless eye <eos> the passing crowded stage coach reeling bye <eos> he talks to none but wends his silent way <eos> and finds a hovel at the close of day <eos> or under any hedge his house is made <eos> he has no calling and he owns no trade <eos> an old smoaked blanket arches oer his head <eos> a whisp of straw or stubble makes his bed <eos> he knows a lawless law that claims no kin <eos> but meet and plunder on and feel no sin <eos> no matter where they go or where they dwell <eos> they dally with the winds and laugh at hell <eos>
pale are my looks , forsaken of my life <eos> cinders my bones , consum è d with thy flame <eos> floods are my tears , to end this burning strife <eos> and yet i sigh for to increase the same <eos> i mourn alone because alone i burn <eos> who doubts of this , then let him learn to love <eos> her looks cold ice into a flame can turn <eos> as i distress è d in myself do prove <eos> respect , fair licia , what my torments are <eos> count but the tithe both of my sighs and tears <eos> see how my love doth still increase my care <eos> and care 's increase my life to nothing wears <eos> send but a sigh my flame for to increase <eos> or lend a tear and cause it so to cease <eos>
“ so sang the nautch girl to the pipe and wires <eos> fluttering like some vain , painted butterfly <eos> from glade to glade along the forest path <eos> nor dreamed her light words echoed on the ear <eos> of him , that holy man , who sate so rapt <eos> under the fig tree by the path . but buddh <eos> lifted his great brow as the wantons passed <eos> and spake : ‘ the foolish ofttimes teach the wise <eos> i strain too much this string of life , belike <eos> meaning to make such music as shall save <eos> mine eyes are dim now that they see the truth <eos> my strength is waned now that my need is most <eos> would that i had such help as man must have <eos> for i shall die , whose life was all men 's hope <eos>

i never saw that you did painting need <eos> and therefore to your fair no painting set <eos> i found ( or thought i found ) you did exceed <eos> that barren tender of a poet 's debt <eos> and therefore have i slept in your report <eos> that you your self being extant well might show <eos> how far a modern quill doth come too short <eos> speaking of worth , what worth in you doth grow <eos> this silence for my sin you did impute <eos> which shall be most my glory being dumb <eos> for i impair not beauty being mute <eos> when others would give life , and bring a tomb <eos> there lives more life in one of your fair eyes <eos> than both your poets can in praise devise <eos>

my love was masked , and arm è d with a fan <eos> to see the sun so careless of his light <eos> which stood and gazed , and gazing wax è d wan <eos> to see a star himself that was more bright <eos> some did surmize she hid her from the sun <eos> of whom in pride she scorned for to be kissed <eos> or feared the harm by him to others done <eos> but these the reason of this wonder missed <eos> nor durst the sun , if that her face were bare <eos> in greatest pride , presume to take a kiss <eos> but she more kind did show she had more care <eos> than with her eyes eclipse him of his bliss <eos> unmask you , sweet , and spare not ; dim the sun <eos> your light 's enough , although that his were done <eos>
how oft when thou , my music , music play'st <eos> upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds <eos> with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st <eos> the wiry concord that mine ear confounds <eos> do i envy those jacks that nimble leap <eos> to kiss the tender inward of thy hand <eos> whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap <eos> at the wood 's boldness by thee blushing stand <eos> to be so tickled they would change their state <eos> and situation with those dancing chips <eos> o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait <eos> making dead wood more blest than living lips <eos> since saucy jacks so happy are in this <eos> give them thy fingers , me thy lips to kiss <eos>
oft let me range the gloomy aisles alone <eos> sad luxury ! to vulgar minds unknown <eos> along the walls where speaking marbles show <eos> what worthies form the hallowed mould belew <eos> proud names , who once the reins of empire held <eos> in arms who triumphed , or in arts excelled <eos> chiefs , graced with scars , and prodigal of blood <eos> stern patriots , who for sacred freedom stood <eos> just men , by whom impartial laws were given <eos> and saints , who taught and led the way to heaven <eos> ne'er to these chambers , where the mighty rest <eos> since their foundation came a nobler guest <eos> nor e'er was to the bowers of bliss conveyed <eos> a fairer spirit or more welcome shade <eos>
as by the west wind driv'n , the ocean waves <eos> dash forward on the far resounding shore <eos> wave upon wave ; first curls the ruffled sea <eos> with whit'ning crests ; anon with thund'ring roar <eos> it breaks upon the beach , and from the crags <eos> recoiling flings in giant curves its head <eos> aloft , and tosses high the wild sea spray <eos> column on column , so the hosts of greece <eos> pour 'd , ceaseless , to the war ; to each the chiefs <eos> their orders gave ; the rest in silence mov 'd <eos> nor would ye deem that mighty mass endued <eos> with power of speech , so silently they moved <eos> in awe of their great captains : far around <eos> flashed the bright armour they were girt withal <eos>
where dim the ethereal eye , no art , though clear <eos> as golden star in morning 's amber springs <eos> can pierce the fogs of low imaginings <eos> painting and sculpture are a mockery mere <eos> where dull to deafness is the hearing ear <eos> vain is the poet . nought but earthly things <eos> have credence . when the soaring skylark sings <eos> how shall the stony statue strain to hear <eos> open the deaf ear , wake the sleeping eye <eos> and lo , musicians , painters , poets — all <eos> trooping instinctive , come without a call <eos> as winds that where they list blow evermore <eos> as waves from silent deserts roll to die <eos> in mighty voices on the peopled shore <eos>
in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn <eos> but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing <eos> in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn <eos> in vowing new hate after new love bearing <eos> but why of two oaths ’ breach do i accuse thee <eos> when i break twenty ? i am perjured most <eos> for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee <eos> and all my honest faith in thee is lost <eos> for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness <eos> oaths of thy love , thy truth , thy constancy <eos> and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness <eos> or made them swear against the thing they see <eos> for i have sworn thee fair : more perjured i <eos> to swear against the truth so foul a be <eos>
o star of morning and of liberty <eos> o bringer of the light , whose splendor shines <eos> above the darkness of the apennines <eos> forerunner of the day that is to be <eos> the voices of the city and the sea <eos> the voices of the mountains and the pines <eos> repeat thy song , till the familiar lines <eos> are footpaths for the thought of italy <eos> thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights <eos> through all the nations , and a sound is heard <eos> as of a mighty wind , and men devout <eos> strangers of rome , and the new proselytes <eos> in their own language hear thy wondrous word <eos> and many are amazed and many doubt <eos>
through suffering and sorrow thou hast passed <eos> to show us what a woman true may be <eos> they have not taken sympathy from thee <eos> nor made thee any other than thou wast <eos> save as some tree , which , in a sudden blast <eos> sheddeth those blossoms , that are weakly grown <eos> upon the air , but keepeth every one <eos> whose strength gives warrant of good fruit at last <eos> so thou hast shed some blooms of gayety <eos> but never one of steadfast cheerfulness <eos> nor hath thy knowledge of adversity <eos> robbed thee of any faith in happiness <eos> but rather cleared thine inner eyes to see <eos> how many simple ways there are to bless <eos>
it hath been heretofore my chance to see <eos> horsemen with martial order shifting camp <eos> to onset sallying , or in muster rang 'd <eos> or in retreat sometimes outstretch 'd for flight <eos> light armed squadrons and fleet foragers <eos> scouring thy plains , arezzo ! have i seen <eos> and clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts <eos> now with the sound of trumpets , now of bells <eos> tabors , or signals made from castled heights <eos> and with inventions multiform , our own <eos> or introduc 'd from foreign land ; but ne'er <eos> to such a strange recorder i beheld <eos> in evolution moving , horse nor foot <eos> nor ship , that tack 'd by sign from land or star <eos>
if in this storm of joy and pompous throng <eos> this nymph ( great king ) doth come to thee so near <eos> that thy harmonious ears her accents hear <eos> give pardon to her hoarse and lowly song <eos> fain would she trophies to thy virtues rear <eos> but for this stately task she is not strong <eos> and her defects her high attempts do wrong <eos> yet as she could she makes thy worth appear <eos> so in a map is shown this flowery place <eos> so wrought in arras by a virgin 's hand <eos> with heaven and blazing stars doth atlas stand <eos> so drawn by charcoal is narcissus ’ face <eos> she like the morn may be to some bright sun <eos> the day to perfect that 's by her begun <eos>
again i follow it , throughout the day <eos> with anxious eyes i see it trip and fall <eos> and hurt itself in many a foolish way <eos> childlike , unheeding warning word or call <eos> i see it grasp , and grasping , break the toys <eos> it cried to own , then toss them on the floor <eos> and , breathless , hurry after fancied joys <eos> that cease to please , when added to its store <eos> i see the lacerations on its hands <eos> made by forbidden tools ; but when it weeps <eos> i also weep , as one who understands <eos> and having been a child , the memory keeps <eos> ah , my poor world , however wrong thy part <eos> still is there pity in my mother heart <eos>
sweet heart , forgive me for thine own sweet sake <eos> whose kind blithe soul such seas of sorrow swam <eos> and for my love 's sake , powerless as i am <eos> for love to praise thee , or like thee to make <eos> music of mirth where hearts less pure would break <eos> less pure than thine , our life unspotted lamb <eos> things hatefullest thou hadst not heart to damn <eos> nor wouldst have set thine heel on this dead snake <eos> let worms consume its memory with its tongue <eos> the fang that stabbed fair truth , the lip that stung <eos> men 's memories uncorroded with its breath <eos> forgive me , that with bitter words like his <eos> i mix the gentlest english name that is <eos> the tenderest held of all that know not death <eos>
o opulent life of ours , though dispossessed <eos> of treasure after treasure ! youth most fair <eos> went first , but left its priceless coil of hair <eos> moaned over sleepless nights , kissed and caressed <eos> through drip and blur of tears the tenderest <eos> and next went love — the ripe rose glowing there <eos> her very sister !... it is here ; but where <eos> is she , of all the world the first and best <eos> and yet how sweet the sweet earth after rain <eos> how sweet the sunlight on the garden wall <eos> across the roses — and how sweetly flows <eos> the limpid yodel of the brook again <eos> and yet — and yet how sweeter after all <eos> the smouldering sweetness of a dead red rose <eos>
i would i were that portly gentleman <eos> with gold laced hat and golden headed cane <eos> who hangs in delia 's parlor ! for whene'er <eos> from book or needlework her looks arise <eos> on him converge the sun beams of her eyes <eos> and he unblamed may gaze upon my fair <eos> and oft my fair his favored form surveys <eos> o happy picture ! still on her to gaze <eos> i envy him ! and jealous fear alarms <eos> lest the strong glance of those divinest charms <eos> warm him to life , as in the ancient days <eos> when marble melted in pygmalion 's arms <eos> i would i were that portly gentleman <eos> with gold laced hat and golden headed cane <eos>
it is not , y ’ are deceav 'd , it is not blisse <eos> what you conceave a happy living is <eos> to have your hands with rubies bright to glow <eos> then on your tortoise bed your body throw <eos> and sink your self in down , to drink in gold <eos> and have your looser self in purple roll 'd <eos> with royal fare to make the tables groan <eos> or else with what from lybick fields is mown <eos> nor in one vault hoard all your magazine <eos> but at no cowards fate t ’ have frighted bin <eos> nor with the peoples breath to be swol'n great <eos> nor at a drawn stiletto basely swear <eos> he that dares this , nothing to him 's unfit <eos> but proud o ’ th ’ top of fortunes wheel may sit <eos>
thus as he spoke , the shades of death o'erspread <eos> his eyes and nostrils ; then with foot firm set <eos> upon his chest , patroclus from the corpse <eos> drew , by main force , the fast adhering spear <eos> the life forth issuing with the weapon 's point <eos> loos 'd from the royal car , the snorting steeds <eos> eager for flight , the myrmidons detain 'd <eos> deep grieving , glaucus heard his voice : and chafed <eos> his spirit within him , that he lacked the power <eos> to aid his comrade ; with his hand he grasp 'd <eos> his wounded arm , in torture from the shaft <eos> by teucer shot , to save the greeks from death <eos> as on he pressed to scale the lofty wall <eos> then to apollo thus address 'd his pray'r <eos>
v. and love had not been prisoned in cold stone <eos> nor beauty smeared on the dead canvas so <eos> had not their worshipper been forced to go <eos> questful and restless through the world alone <eos> searching but finding not , till on him shone <eos> back from his own deep heart a chilly glow <eos> as of a frost nipped sunbeam , or of snow <eos> under a storm dodged crescent which hath grown <eos> wasted to mockery ; and beneath such gleam <eos> his wan conceits have found an utterance <eos> which , had they found a true and sunny beam <eos> had ripened into real touch and glance <eos> nay more , to real deed , the truth of all <eos> to some perfection high and personal <eos>
so take these kindly , even though there be <eos> some notes that unto other lyres belong <eos> stray echoes from the elder sons of song <eos> and think how from its neighbouring native sea <eos> the pensive shell doth borrow melody <eos> i would not do the lordly masters wrong <eos> by filching fair words from the shining throng <eos> whose music haunts me as the wind a tree <eos> lo , when a stranger in soft syrian glooms <eos> shot through with sunset , treads the cedar dells <eos> and hears the breezy ring of elfin bells <eos> far down be where the white haired cataract booms <eos> he , faint with sweetness caught from forest smells <eos> bears thence , unwitting , plunder of perfumes <eos>
surely the boy his sister 's secret guessed <eos> since only kindness dwells within his breast <eos> toward his ancestral foe . by friendly signs <eos> each comely youth the other 's thought divines <eos> then suddenly exclaims the dauntless sioux <eos> “ listen , my friend ! i must return with you <eos> to ask and win this maiden for my wife <eos> “ return with us ! not if you prize your life <eos> the startled blackfoot answers . “ you must know <eos> that all our tribe regard you as a foe <eos> my sister 's suitors are as many now <eos> as yonder leaves that twinkle on the bough <eos> should a dakota venture such a plea <eos> our jealous youth would slay him instantly <eos>
was it the worke of nature or of art <eos> which tempred so the feature of her face <eos> that pride and meeknesse , mist by equall part <eos> doe both appeare t'adorne her beauties grace <eos> for with mild pleasance , which doth pride displace <eos> she to her love doth lookers eyes allure <eos> and with stern countenance back again doth chace <eos> their looser lookes that stir up lustes impure <eos> with such strange termes * her eyes she doth inure <eos> that with one looke she doth my life dismay <eos> and with another doth it streight recure <eos> her smile me drawes ; her frowne me drives away <eos> thus doth she traine and teach me with her lookes <eos> such art of eyes i never read in bookes <eos>
whether he lurked in the oldtown fen <eos> or the gray earth flax of the devil 's den <eos> or swam in the wooded artichoke <eos> or coiled by the northman 's written rock <eos> nothing on record is left to show <eos> only the fact that he lived , we know <eos> and left the cast of a double head <eos> in the scaly mask which he yearly shed <eos> for he carried a head where his tail should be <eos> and the two , of course , could never agree <eos> but wriggled about with main and might <eos> now to the left and now to the right <eos> pulling and twisting this way and that <eos> neither knew what the other was at <eos>
great truths are portions of the soul of man <eos> great souls are portions of eternity <eos> each drop of blood that e'er through true heart ran <eos> with lofty message , ran for thee and me <eos> for god 's law , since the starry song began <eos> hath been , and still forevermore must be <eos> that every deed which shall outlast time 's span <eos> must spur the soul to be erect and free <eos> slave is no word of deathless lineage sprung <eos> too many noble souls have thought and died <eos> too many mighty poets lived and sung <eos> and our good saxon , from lips purified <eos> with martyr fire , throughout the world hath rung <eos> too long to have god 's holy cause denied <eos>
yet while they rode together down the plain <eos> their talk was all of training , terms of art <eos> diet and seeling , jesses , leash and lure <eos> ‘ she is too noble ’ he said ‘ to check at pies <eos> nor will she rake : there is no baseness in her <eos> here when the queen demanded as by chance <eos> ‘ know ye the stranger woman ? ’ ‘ let her be <eos> said lancelot and unhooded casting off <eos> the goodly falcon free ; she towered ; her bells <eos> tone under tone , shrilled ; and they lifted up <eos> their eager faces , wondering at the strength <eos> boldness and royal knighthood of the bird <eos> who pounced her quarry and slew it . many a time <eos> as once — of old — among the flowers — they rode <eos>
“ take this , and pour to jove ; that safe from harms <eos> his grace restore thee to our roof and arms <eos> since victor of thy fears , and slighting mine <eos> heaven , or thy soul , inspires this bold design <eos> pray to that god , who high on ida ’ s brow <eos> surveys thy desolated realms below <eos> his winged messenger to send from high <eos> and lead thy way with heavenly augury <eos> let the strong sovereign of the plumy race <eos> tower on the right of yon ethereal space <eos> that sign beheld , and strengthen ’ d from above <eos> boldly pursue the journey mark ’ d by jove <eos> but if the god his augury denies <eos> suppress thy impulse , nor reject advice <eos>
come walk with me along this willowed lane <eos> where , like lost coinage from some miser 's store <eos> the golden dandelions more and more <eos> glow , as the warm sun kisses them again <eos> for this is may ! who with a daisy chain <eos> leads on the laughing hours ; for now is o'er <eos> long winter 's trance . no longer rise and roar <eos> his forest wrenching blasts . the hopeful swain <eos> along the furrow , sings behind his team <eos> loud pipes the redbreast — troubadour of spring <eos> and vocal all the morning copses ring <eos> more blue the skies in lucent lakelets gleam <eos> and the glad earth , caressed by murmuring showers <eos> wakes like a bride , to deck herself with flowers <eos>
less bronze , more silver , mingles in the mould <eos> of him whom next my roving eyes behold <eos> his , more the scholar 's than the statesman 's face <eos> proclaims him born of academic race <eos> weary his look , as if an aching brain <eos> left on his brow the frozen prints of pain <eos> his voice far reaching , grave , sonorous , owns <eos> a shade of sadness in its plaintive tones <eos> yet when its breath some loftier thought inspires <eos> glows with a heat that every bosom fires <eos> such everett seems ; no chance sown wild flower knows <eos> the full blown charms of culture 's double rose <eos> alas , how soon , by death 's unsparing frost <eos> its bloom is faded and its fragrance lost <eos>
“ ye sons of atreus , and ye greeks , give ear <eos> the words of troy , and troy ’ s great monarch , hear <eos> pleased may ye hear ( so heaven succeed my prayers <eos> what paris , author of the war , declares <eos> the spoils and treasures he to ilion bore <eos> ( oh had he perish ’ d ere they touch ’ d our shore <eos> he proffers injured greece : with large increase <eos> of added trojan wealth to buy the peace <eos> but to restore the beauteous bride again <eos> this greece demands , and troy requests in vain <eos> next , o ye chiefs ! we ask a truce to burn <eos> our slaughter ’ d heroes , and their bones inurn <eos> that done , once more the fate of war be tried <eos> and whose the conquest , mighty jove decide <eos>
cromwell , our chief of men , who through a cloud <eos> not of war only , but detractions rude <eos> guided by faith and matchless fortitude <eos> to peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed <eos> and on the neck of crown è d fortune proud <eos> hast reared god 's trophies , and his work pursued <eos> while darwen stream , with blood of scots imbrued <eos> and dunbar field , resounds thy praises loud <eos> and worcester 's laureate wreath : yet much remains <eos> to conquer still ; peace hath her victories <eos> no less renowned than war : new foes arise <eos> threatening to bind our souls with secular chains <eos> help us to save free conscience from the paw <eos> of hireling wolves whose gospel is their maw <eos>
so saying , from the carven flower above <eos> to which it made a restless heart , he took <eos> and gave , the diamond : then from where he sat <eos> at arthur 's right , with smiling face arose <eos> with smiling face and frowning heart , a prince <eos> in the mid might and flourish of his may <eos> gawain , surnamed the courteous , fair and strong <eos> and after lancelot , tristram , and geraint <eos> and gareth , a good knight , but therewithal <eos> sir modred 's brother , and the child of lot <eos> nor often loyal to his word , and now <eos> wroth that the king 's command to sally forth <eos> in quest of whom he knew not , made him leave <eos> the banquet , and concourse of knights and kings <eos>
beyond the north wind lay the land of old <eos> where men dwelt blithe and blameless , clothed and fed <eos> with joy 's bright raiment and with love 's sweet bread <eos> the whitest flock of earth 's maternal fold <eos> none there might wear about his brows enrolled <eos> a light of lovelier fame than rings your head <eos> whose lovesome love of children and the dead <eos> all men give thanks for : i far off behold <eos> a dear dead hand that links us , and a light <eos> the blithest and benignest of the night <eos> the night of death 's sweet sleep , wherein may be <eos> a star to show your spirit in present sight <eos> some happier island in the elysian sea <eos> where rab may lick the hand of marjorie <eos>
not in such grief she left her country 's shores <eos> when caesar 's host drew near ; for now she leaves <eos> though faithful to her lord , his side in flight <eos> and flees her spouse . all that next night she waked <eos> then first what means a widowed couch she knew <eos> its cold , its solitude . when slumber found <eos> her eyelids , and forgetfulness her soul <eos> seeking with outstretched arms the form beloved <eos> she grasps but air . though tossed by restless love <eos> she leaves a place beside her as for him <eos> returning . yet she feared pompeius lost <eos> to her for ever . but the gods ordained <eos> worse than her fears , and in the hour of woe <eos> gave her to look upon his face again <eos>
say what you will , there is not in the world <eos> a nobler sight than from this upper down <eos> no rugged landscape here , no beauty hurled <eos> from its creator 's hand as with a frown <eos> but a green plain on which green hills look down <eos> trim as a garden plot . no other hue <eos> can hence be seen , save here and there the brown <eos> of a square fallow , and the horizon 's blue <eos> dear checker work of woods , the sussex weald <eos> if a name thrills me yet of things of earth <eos> that name is thine ! how often i have fled <eos> to thy deep hedgerows and embraced each field <eos> each lag , each pasture ,— fields which gave me birth <eos> and saw my youth , and which must hold me dead <eos>
o than the fairest day , thrice fairer night <eos> night to blest days in which a sun doth rise <eos> of which that golden age which clears the skies <eos> is but a sparkling ray , a shadow light <eos> and blessed ye , in silly pastors ’ sight <eos> mild creatures , in whose warm crib now lies <eos> that heaven sent youngling , holy maid born wight <eos> midst , end , beginning of our prophecies <eos> blest cottage that hath flowers in winter spread <eos> though withered — blessed grass that hath the grace <eos> to deck and be a carpet to that place <eos> thus sang , unto the sounds , of oaten reed <eos> before the babe , the shepherds bowed on knees <eos> and springs ran nectar , honey dropped from trees <eos>
once more upon the ocean 's heaving breast <eos> he lays his head , not like the lover bold <eos> who in the brave , chivalric days of old <eos> wooed from her lips the secret of the west <eos> but like a tired man going to his rest <eos> no hopes to thrill , no yearnings to inspire <eos> no tasks to burden , and no toil to tire <eos> no morn to waken to a day of quest <eos> again upon the trackless deep ,— again <eos> about him as of yore the wild winds play <eos> behind him lies the world he gave to men <eos> before a grave in old castile for aye <eos> peace , winds and tides ! be calm , thou guardian sky <eos> the lordliest dust of earth is passing by <eos>

and , as a savage boar , on mountains bred <eos> with forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed <eos> when once he sees himself in toils inclos 'd <eos> by huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd  <eos> he whets his tusks , and turns , and dares the war <eos> th ’ invaders dart their jav'lins from afar <eos> all keep aloof , and safely shout around <eos> but none presumes to give a nearer wound <eos> he frets and froths , erects his bristled hide <eos> and shakes a grove of lances from his side <eos> not otherwise the troops , with hate inspir 'd <eos> and just revenge against the tyrant fir 'd <eos> their darts with clamor at a distance drive <eos> and only keep the languish 'd war alive <eos>
and thou who fearest something that may come <eos> around whose house the storm of terror breaks <eos> all night ; to whose love sharpened ear , all day <eos> the invisible is calling at the door <eos> to render up a life thou canst not keep <eos> or love that will not stay ,— open thy door <eos> and carry out thy dying to the marge <eos> of the great sea ; yea , walk into the flood <eos> and lay thy dead upon the moaning waves <eos> give them to god to bury ; float them again <eos> with sighs and prayers to waft them through the gloom <eos> back to the spring of life . say — “ if they die <eos> thou , the one life of life , art still alive <eos> and thou canst make thy dead alive again <eos>
great men have been among us ; hands that penn 'd <eos> and tongues that utter 'd wisdom , better none <eos> the later sydney , marvel , harrington <eos> young vane , and others who call 'd milton friend <eos> these moralists could act and comprehend <eos> they knew how genuine glory was put on <eos> taught us how rightfully a nation shone <eos> in splendor : what strength was , that would not bend <eos> but in magnanimous meekness . france , ‘ tis strange <eos> hath brought forth no such souls as we had then <eos> perpetual emptiness ! unceasing change <eos> no single volume paramount , no code <eos> no master spirit , no determined road <eos> but equally a want of books and men <eos>
nor , in the trojan camp , did hector leave <eos> the chiefs to rest ; but all to conf'rence call 'd <eos> the leaders and the councillors of troy <eos> to whom his prudent speech he thus address 'd <eos> “ who is there here , that for a rich reward <eos> a noble work will undertake ? a car <eos> and two strong collar 'd horses , best of all <eos> that can be found within the grecian lines <eos> shall he receive , who , to his endless praise <eos> shall dare approach the ships ; and learn if still <eos> they keep their wonted watch , or , by our arms <eos> subdued and vanquished , meditate retreat <eos> and , worn with toil , the nightly watch neglect <eos> thus hector spoke ; but all in silence heard <eos>
beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan <eos> for that deep wound it gives my friend and me <eos> is't not enough to torture me alone <eos> but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be <eos> me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken <eos> and my next self thou harder hast engrossed <eos> of him , my self , and thee i am forsaken <eos> a torment thrice three fold thus to be crossed <eos> prison my heart in thy steel bosom 's ward <eos> but then my friend 's heart let my poor heart bail <eos> whoe'er keeps me , let my heart be his guard <eos> thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol <eos> and yet thou wilt , for i being pent in thee <eos> perforce am thine and all that is in me <eos>
could time , his flight reversed , restore the hours <eos> when , playing with thy vesture 's tissued flowers <eos> the violet , the pink , the jessamine <eos> i pricked them into paper with a pin <eos> ( and thou wast happier than myself the while <eos> wouldst softly speak , and stroke my head and smile <eos> could those few pleasant days again appear <eos> might one wish bring them , would i wish them here <eos> i would not trust my heart — the dear delight <eos> seems so to be desired , perhaps i might <eos> but no — what here we call our life is such <eos> so little to be loved , and thou so much <eos> that i should ill requite thee to constrain <eos> thy unbound spirit into bonds again <eos>
if matter changed and turned to fire acquires <eos> the movement of a lighter element <eos> rising aloft unto the highest heaven <eos> wherefore , ignited by the fire of love <eos> swifter than wind , dost thou not rise and flash <eos> into the sun and be incorporate there <eos> why rather stay a pilgrim here below <eos> than open through the air and us a way <eos> no spark of fire from that heart <eos> goes out through the wide atmosphere <eos> body of dust and ashes is not seen <eos> nor water laden smoke ascends on high <eos> all is contained entire within itself <eos> and not of flame , is reason , sense , or thought <eos>
i like the man who faces what he must <eos> with step triumphant and a heart of cheer <eos> who fights the daily battle without fear <eos> sees his hopes fail , yet keeps unfaltering trust <eos> that god is god ; that somehow , true and just <eos> his plans work out for mortals ; not a tear <eos> is shed when fortune , which the world holds dear <eos> falls from his grasp : better , with love , a crust <eos> than living in dishonor : envies not <eos> nor loses faith in man ; but does his best <eos> nor ever murmurs at his humbler lot <eos> but , with a smile and words of hope , gives zest <eos> to every toiler : he alone is great <eos> who by a life heroic conquers fate <eos>
‘ man is of soul and body , formed for deeds <eos> of high resolve , on fancy 's boldest wing <eos> to soar unwearied , fearlessly to turn <eos> the keenest pangs to peacefulness , and taste <eos> the joys which mingled sense and spirit yield <eos> or he is formed for abjectness and woe <eos> to grovel on the dunghill of his fears <eos> to shrink at every sound , to quench the flame <eos> of natural love in sensualism , to know <eos> that hour as blessed when on his worthless days <eos> the frozen hand of death shall set its seal <eos> yet fear the cure , though hating the disease <eos> the one is man that shall hereafter be <eos> the other , man as vice has made him now <eos>
on went the pair , until they reached the bound <eos> where the great linden stood , set deep in snow <eos> up to the lower branches . “ here we stop <eos> said eva , “ for my mother has my word <eos> that i will go no further than this tree <eos> then the snow maiden laughed : “ and what is this <eos> this fear of the pure snow , the innocent snow <eos> that never harmed aught living ? thou mayst roam <eos> for leagues beyond this garden , and return <eos> in safety ; here the grim wolf never prowls <eos> and here the eagle of our mountain crags <eos> preys not in winter . i will show the way <eos> and bring thee safely home . thy mother , sure <eos> counselled thee thus because thou hadst no guide <eos>
having this day my horse , my hand , my lance <eos> guided so well , that i obtain 'd the prize <eos> both by the judgment of the english eyes <eos> and of some sent from that sweet enemy france <eos> horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance <eos> townfolks my strength ; a daintier judge applies <eos> his praise to sleight which from good use doth rise <eos> some lucky wits impute it but to chance <eos> others , because of both sides i do take <eos> my blood from them who did excel in this <eos> think nature me a man of arms did make <eos> how far they shot awry ! the true cause is <eos> stella look 'd on , and from her heavenly face <eos> sent forth the beams which made so fair my race <eos>
the darkness in the loft is sweet and warm <eos> with the stored hay ... darkness intensified <eos> by one bright shaft that enters through the wide <eos> tall doors from under fringes of a storm <eos> which makes the doomed sun brighter . on the hay <eos> perched mountain high they sit , and silently <eos> watch the motes dance and look at the dark sky <eos> and mark how heartbreakingly far away <eos> and yet how close and clear the distance seems <eos> while all at hand is cloud — brightness of dreams <eos> unrealisable , yet seen so clear <eos> so only just beyond the dark . they wait <eos> scarce knowing what they wait for , half in fear <eos> expectance draws the curtain from their fate <eos>
there hung a calm and solemn sunshine round <eos> those mighty monuments , a hushing sound <eos> in the still air that circled them which stole <eos> like music of past times into my soul <eos> i thought what myriads of the wise and brave <eos> and beautiful had sunk into the grave <eos> since earth first saw these wonders — and i said <eos> “ are things eternal only for the dead <eos> “ hath man no loftier hope than this which dooms <eos> “ his only lasting trophies to be tombs <eos> “ but ‘ tis not so — earth , heaven , all nature shows <eos> “ he may become immortal — may unclose <eos> “ the wings within him wrapt , and proudly rise <eos> “ redeemed from earth , a creature of the skies <eos>
what i have instanced only in the best <eos> is , in proportion , true of all the rest <eos> take pains the genuine meaning to explore <eos> there sweat , there strain : tug the laborious oar <eos> search every comment that your care can find <eos> some here , some there , may hit the poet 's mind <eos> yet be not blindly guided by the throng <eos> the multitude is always in the wrong <eos> when things appear unnatural or hard <eos> consult your author , with himself compared <eos> who knows what blessing phoebus may bestow <eos> and future ages to your labour owe <eos> such secrets are not easily found out <eos> but , once discovered , leave no room for doubt <eos>
he scampered to the bushes far away <eos> the shepherd called the ploughman to the fray <eos> the ploughman wished he had a gun to shoot <eos> the old dog barked and followed the pursuit <eos> the shepherd threw his hook and tottered past <eos> the ploughman ran but none could go so fast <eos> the woodman threw his faggot from the way <eos> and ceased to chop and wondered at the fray <eos> but when he saw the dog and heard the cry <eos> he threw his hatchet — but the fox was bye <eos> the shepherd broke his hook and lost the skin <eos> he found a badger hole and bolted in <eos> they tried to dig , but , safe from danger 's way <eos> he lived to chase the hounds another day <eos>
under that foggy sunset london glowed <eos> like one huge cob webbed flagon of old wine <eos> and , as i walked down fleet street , the soft sky <eos> mowed thro ’ the roaring thoroughfares , transfused <eos> their hard sharp outlines , blurred the throngs of black <eos> on either pavement , blurred the rolling stream <eos> of red and yellow busses , till the town <eos> turned to a golden suburb of the clouds <eos> and , round that mighty bubble of st. paul 's <eos> over the up turned faces of the street <eos> an air ship slowly sailed , with whirring fans <eos> a voyager in the new found realms of gold <eos> a shadowy silken chrysalis whence should break <eos> what radiant wings in centuries to be <eos>
the monarch now ascends the sacred dome <eos> the sun 's fixt image there partakes the gloom <eos> thro all the shrines , where erst on new moon day <eos> swell 'd the full quires of consecrated praise <eos> a tomb like silence reigns ; till female cries <eos> burst forth at last , and these sad accents rise <eos> was it for this , my son to distant lands <eos> must trace the wilds , and tempt those lawless bands <eos> and does the god obscure his golden throne <eos> in mournful darkness for my slaughter 'd son <eos> oh , had his beam ; ere that disastrous day <eos> that call 'd the youth from these fond arms away <eos> received my spirit to its native sky <eos> that sad oella might have seen him die <eos>
these five kings said one to another <eos> ‘ king unto king o'er the world is brother <eos> seeing that now , for a sign and a wonder <eos> a red eclipse and a tongue of thunder <eos> a shape and a finger of desolation <eos> is come against us a kingless nation <eos> gibeon hath failed us : it were not good <eos> that a man remember where gibeon stood <eos> then gibeon sent to our captain , crying <eos> ‘ son of nun , let a shaft be flying <eos> for unclean birds are gathering greedily <eos> slack not thy hand , but come thou speedily <eos> yea , we are lost save thou maintain'st us <eos> for the kings of the mountains are gathered against us <eos>
thou splendid girl that seemest the mother of all <eos> dear ceres aphrodite , with every lure <eos> that draws the bee to honey , with the call <eos> of moth winged night to sinners , yet as pure <eos> as the white nun that counts the stars for beads <eos> thou blest madonna of all broken needs <eos> thou melusine , thou sister of sorrowing man <eos> thou wave like laughter , thou dear sob in the throat <eos> thou all enfolding mercy , and thou song <eos> that gathers up each wild and wandering note <eos> and takes and breaks and heals and breaks the heart <eos> with the omnipotent tenderness of art <eos> and thou intelligence of rose leaves made <eos> that makes that little thing the brain afraid <eos>

betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took <eos> and each doth good turns now unto the other <eos> when that mine eye is famished for a look <eos> or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother <eos> with my love 's picture then my eye doth feast <eos> and to the painted banquet bids my heart <eos> another time mine eye is my heart 's guest <eos> and in his thoughts of love doth share a part <eos> so either by thy picture or my love <eos> thy self away , art present still with me <eos> for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move <eos> and i am still with them , and they with thee <eos> or if they sleep , thy picture in my sight <eos> awakes my heart , to heart 's and eye 's delight <eos>

no rose that in a garden ever grew <eos> in homer 's or in omar 's or in mine <eos> though buried under centuries of fine <eos> dead dust of roses , shut from sun and dew <eos> forever , and forever lost from view <eos> but must again in fragrance rich as wine <eos> the grey aisles of the air incarnadine <eos> when the old summers surge into a new <eos> thus when i swear , “ i love with all my heart <eos> ‘ tis with the heart of lilith that i swear <eos> ‘ tis with the love of lesbia and lucrece <eos> and thus as well my love must lose some part <eos> of what it is , had helen been less fair <eos> or perished young , or stayed at home in greece <eos>

schonbergh , the ablest soldier of his age <eos> with great nassau did in our cause engage <eos> both join 'd for england 's rescue and defence <eos> the greatest captain and the greatest prince <eos> with what applause his stories did we tell <eos> stories which europe 's volumes largely swell <eos> we counted him an army in our aid <eos> where he commanded , no man was afraid <eos> his actions with a constant conquest shine <eos> from villa vitiosa to the rhine <eos> france , flanders , germany , his fame confess <eos> and all the world was fond of him but us <eos> our turn first served , we grudged him the command <eos> witness the grateful temper of the land <eos>
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes <eos> and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he <eos> remembered in what a haughtier guise <eos> he had flung an alms to leprosie <eos> when he girt his young life up in gilded mail <eos> and set forth in search of the holy grail <eos> the heart within him was ashes and dust <eos> he parted in twain his single crust <eos> he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink <eos> and gave the leper to eat and drink <eos> ‘ t was a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread <eos> ‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl <eos> yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed <eos> and ‘ t was red wine he drank with his thirsty soul <eos>
this the event ! here springs the temple grand <eos> whose mighty arches take in all the land <eos> its twilight aisles stretch far away and reach <eos> ‘ mid lights and shadows which defy my speech <eos> and near its portal which morn opened wide <eos> grey janitor !— to let in all this tide <eos> of prayerful men , most solemnly there stands <eos> one recollection , which , for pious hands <eos> is ready like the minster 's sculptured vase <eos> with holy water for each reverent face <eos> and mystic columns , which my fancy views <eos> glow in a thousand soft , subduing hues <eos> flung through the stained windows of the past in gloom <eos> of royal purple o'er our warrior 's tomb <eos>

rise from your gory ashes stern and pale <eos> ye martyred thousands ! and with dreadful ire <eos> a voice of doom , a front of gloomy fire <eos> rebuke those faithless souls , whose querulous wail <eos> disturbs your sacred sleep !— “ the withering hail <eos> of battle , hunger , pestilence , despair <eos> whatever of mortal anguish man may bear <eos> we bore unmurmuring ! strengthened by the mail <eos> of a most holy purpose !— then we died <eos> vex not our rest by cries of selfish pain <eos> but to the noblest measure of your powers <eos> endure the appointed trial ! griefs defied <eos> but launch their threatening thunderbolts in vain <eos> and angry storms pass by in gentlest showers <eos>
thank god , he saw you last in pomp of may <eos> ere any leaf had felt the year 's regret <eos> your latest image in his memory set <eos> was fair as when your landscape 's peaceful sway <eos> charmed dearer eyes with his to make delay <eos> on hope 's long prospect ,— as if they forget <eos> the happy , they , the unspeakable three , whose debt <eos> like the hawk 's shadow , blots our brightest day <eos> better it is that ye should look so fair <eos> slopes that he loved , and ever murmuring pines <eos> that make a music out of silent air <eos> and bloom heaped orchard trees in prosperous lines <eos> in you the heart some sweeter hints divines <eos> and wiser , than in winter 's dull despair <eos>

the soul 's rialto hath its merchandize <eos> i barter curl for curl upon that mart <eos> and from my poet 's forehead to my heart <eos> receive this lock which outweighs argosies <eos> as purply black , as erst to pindar 's eyes <eos> the dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart <eos> the nine white muse brows . for this counterpart <eos> the bay crown 's shade , beloved , i surmise <eos> still lingers on thy curl , it is so black <eos> thus , with a fillet of smooth kissing breath <eos> i tie the shadows safe from gliding back <eos> and lay the gift where nothing hindereth <eos> here on my heart , as on thy brow , to lack <eos> no natural heat till mine grows cold in death <eos>

“ lady , i swear your saad 's horse <eos> the prophet himself might have rode a worse <eos> like the knots of a serpent the play of his flesh <eos> as he tore to the quarry in allah 's mesh <eos> i forgot him , and mowed at the traitor weeds <eos> which fell before me like rushes and reeds <eos> or like the tall poppies that sudden drop low <eos> their heads to an urchin 's unstrung bow <eos> fled the giaour ; the faithful flew after to kill <eos> i turned to surrender : beneath me still <eos> was abdon unjaded , fresh in force <eos> faithful and fearless — a heavenly horse <eos> give him water , lady , and barley to eat <eos> then haste thee and fetter the wine bibber 's feet <eos>
i am older than nature and her time <eos> by all the timeless age of consciousness <eos> and my adult oblivion of the clime <eos> where i was born makes me not countryless <eos> ay , and dim through my daylight thoughts escape <eos> yearnings for that land where my childhood dreamed <eos> which i cannot recall in colour or shape <eos> but haunts my hours like something that hath gleamed <eos> and yet is not as light remembered <eos> nor to the left or to the right conceived <eos> and all round me tastes as if life were dead <eos> and the world made but to be disbelieved <eos> thus i my hope on unknown truth lay ; yet <eos> how but by hope do i the unknown truth get <eos>

hear from me , long armed lord ! the makings five <eos> which go to every act , in sankhya taught <eos> as necessary . first the force ; and then <eos> the agent ; next , the various instruments <eos> fourth , the especial effort ; fifth , the god <eos> what work soever any mortal doth <eos> of body , mind , or speech , evil or good <eos> by these five doth he that . which being thus <eos> whoso , for lack of knowledge , seeth himself <eos> as the sole actor , knoweth nought at all <eos> and seeth nought . therefore , i say , if one <eos> holding aloof from self — with unstained mind <eos> should slay all yonder host , being bid to slay <eos> he doth not slay ; he is not bound thereby <eos>

alaciel 's story 's of another kind <eos> and i 've a little altered it , you 'll find <eos> faults some may see , and others disbelieve <eos> ‘ tis all the same :— ‘ twill never make me grieve <eos> alaciel 's mem'ry , it is very clear <eos> can scarcely by it lose ; there 's naught to fear <eos> two facts important i have kept in view <eos> in which the author fully i pursue <eos> the one — no less than eight the belle possessed <eos> before a husband 's sight her eyes had blessed <eos> the other is , the prince she was to wed <eos> ne'er seemed to heed this trespass on his bed <eos> but thought , perhaps , the beauty she had got <eos> would prove to any one a happy lot <eos>
let the sublimer muse , who , wrapp 'd in night <eos> rides on the raven pennons of the storm <eos> or o'er the field , with purple havoc warm <eos> lashes her steeds , and sings along the fight <eos> let her , whom more ferocious strains delight <eos> disdain the plaintive sonnet 's little form <eos> and scorn to its wild cadence to conform <eos> the impetuous tenor of her hardy flight <eos> but me , far lowest of the sylvan train <eos> who wake the wood nymphs from the forest shade <eos> with wildest song ;— me , much behoves thy aid <eos> of mingled melody , to grace my strain <eos> and give it power to please , as soft it flows <eos> through the smooth murmurs of thy frequent close <eos>
why dost thou , delia , credit so thy glass <eos> gazing thy beauty deigned thee by the skies <eos> and dost not rather look on him , alas <eos> whose state best shows the force of murdering eyes <eos> the broken tops of lofty trees declare <eos> the fury of a mercy wanting storm <eos> and of what force thy wounding graces are <eos> upon myself , you best may find the form <eos> then leave thy glass , and gaze thyself on me <eos> that mirror shows what power is in thy face <eos> to view your form too much may danger be <eos> narcissus changed t'a flower in such a case <eos> and you are changed , but not t'a hyacinth <eos> i fear your eye hath turned your heart to flint <eos>
he 's gone — here rest , my soul , thy fainting wing <eos> here recollect thy dissipated pow'rs <eos> our distant int'rests , and our diff'rent passions <eos> now haste to mingle in one common centre <eos> and fate lies crowded in a narrow space <eos> yet , in that narrow space what dangers rise <eos> far more i dread abdalla 's fiery folly <eos> than all the wisdom of the grave divan <eos> reason with reason fights on equal terms <eos> the raging madman 's unconnected schemes <eos> we cannot obviate , for we cannot guess <eos> deep in my breast be treasur 'd this resolve <eos> when cali mounts the throne , abdalla dies <eos> too fierce , too faithless , for neglect or trust <eos>

among the lonely lakes i go no more <eos> for she who made their beauty is not there <eos> the paleface rears his tepee on the shore <eos> and says the vale is fairest of the fair <eos> full many years have vanished since , but still <eos> the voyageurs beside the campfire tell <eos> how , when the moonrise tips the distant hill <eos> they hear strange voices through the silence swell <eos> the paleface loves the haunted lakes they say <eos> and journeys far to watch their beauty spread <eos> before his vision ; but to me the day <eos> the night , the hour , the seasons are all dead <eos> i listen heartsick , while the hunters tell <eos> why white men named the valley the qu'appelle <eos>

though night approaching bids for rest prepare <eos> still the flail echoes through the frosty air <eos> nor stops till deepest shades of darkness come <eos> sending at length the weary laborer home <eos> from him , with bed and nightly food supplied <eos> throughout the yard , hous 'd round on every side <eos> deep plunging cows their rustling feast enjoy <eos> and snatch sweet mouthfuls from the passing boy <eos> who moves unseen beneath his trailing load <eos> fills the tall racks , and leaves a scatter 'd road <eos> where oft the swine from ambush warm and dry <eos> bolt out , and scamper headlong to their sty <eos> when giles with well known voice , already there <eos> deigns them a portion of his evening care <eos>

i know not why — but time , methinks , hath past <eos> more fleet than usual since we parted last <eos> it seems but like a dream of yesternight <eos> whose charm still hangs , with fond , delaying light <eos> and , ere the memory lose one glowing hue <eos> of former joy , we come to kindle new <eos> thus ever may the flying moments haste <eos> with trackless foot along life 's vulgar waste <eos> but deeply print and lingeringly move <eos> when thus they reach the sunny spots we love <eos> oh yes , whatever be our gay career <eos> let this be still the solstice of the year <eos> where pleasure 's sun shall at its height remain <eos> and slowly sink to level life again <eos>

on other shores , above their mouldering towns <eos> in sullen pomp the tall cathedral frowns <eos> pride in its aisles and paupers at the door <eos> which feeds the beggars whom it fleeced of yore <eos> simple and frail , our lowly temples throw <eos> their slender shadows on the paths below <eos> scarce steal the winds , that sweep his woodland tracks <eos> the larch 's perfume from the settler 's axe <eos> ere , like a vision of the morning air <eos> his slight — framed steeple marks the house of prayer <eos> its planks all reeking and its paint undried <eos> its rafters sprouting on the shady side <eos> it sheds the raindrops from its shingled eaves <eos> ere its green brothers once have changed their leaves <eos>
as to the roman that would free his land <eos> his error was his honour and renown <eos> and more the fame of his mistaking hand <eos> than if he had the tyrant overthrown <eos> so delia , hath mine error made me known <eos> and my deceived attempt deserved more fame <eos> than if had the victory mine own <eos> and thy hard heart had yielded up the same <eos> and so likewise renowned is thy blame <eos> thy cruelty , thy glory ; o strange case <eos> that errors should be graced that merit shame <eos> and sin of frowns bring honour to the face <eos> yet happy delia that thou wast unkind <eos> though happier far , if thou would'st change thy mind <eos>
the hope of truth grows stronger , day by day <eos> i hear the soul of man around me waking <eos> like a great sea , its frozen fetters breaking <eos> and flinging up to heaven its sunlit spray <eos> tossing huge continents in scornful play <eos> and crushing them , with din of grinding thunder <eos> that makes old emptinesses stare in wonder <eos> the memory of a glory passed away <eos> lingers in every heart , as , in the shell <eos> resounds the bygone freedom of the sea <eos> and every hour new signs of promise tell <eos> that the great soul shall once again be free <eos> for high , and yet more high , the murmurs swell <eos> of inward strife for truth and liberty <eos>
o , years and tides and leagues and all their billows <eos> can alter not man 's knowledge of men 's hearts <eos> while trees and rocks and clouds include our being <eos> we know the epics of atlantis still <eos> a hero gave himself to lesser men <eos> who first misunderstood and murdered him <eos> and then misunderstood and worshipped him <eos> a woman was lovely and men fought for her <eos> towns burnt for her , and men put men in bondage <eos> but she put lengthier bondage on them all <eos> a wanderer toiled among all the isles <eos> that fleck this turning star of shifting sea <eos> or lonely purgatories of the mind <eos> in longing for his home or his lost love <eos>
“ o soul of battles , and thy people ’ s guide <eos> ( to ajax thus the first of greeks replied <eos> well hast thou spoke ; but at the tyrant ’ s name <eos> my rage rekindles , and my soul ’ s on flame <eos> ’ tis just resentment , and becomes the brave <eos> disgraced , dishonour ’ d , like the vilest slave <eos> return , then , heroes ! and our answer bear <eos> the glorious combat is no more my care <eos> not till , amidst yon sinking navy slain <eos> the blood of greeks shall dye the sable main <eos> not till the flames , by hector ’ s fury thrown <eos> consume your vessels , and approach my own <eos> just there , the impetuous homicide shall stand <eos> there cease his battle , and there feel our hand <eos>
my heart mine eye accuseth of his death <eos> saying his wanton sight bred his unrest <eos> mine eye affirms my heart 's unconstant faith <eos> hath been his bane , and all his joys repressed <eos> my heart avows mine eye let in the fire <eos> which burns him with an everliving light <eos> mine eye replies my greedy heart 's desire <eos> let in those floods , which drown him day and night <eos> thus wars my heart which reason doth maintain <eos> and calls my eye to combat if he dare <eos> the whilst my soul impatient of disdain <eos> wrings from his bondage unto death more near <eos> save that my love still holdeth him in hand <eos> a kingdom thus divided cannot stand <eos>
“ we people that work , ” said the bee with a jerk <eos> “ find a benefit sometimes in stopping <eos> only insects like you , who have nothing to do <eos> can keep perpetually hopping <eos> the grasshopper paused on his way <eos> and thoughtfully hunched up his knees <eos> “ why trouble this sunshiny day <eos> quoth he , “ with reflections like these <eos> i follow the trade for which i was made <eos> we all can n't be wise bumble bees <eos> there 's a time to be sad and a time to be glad <eos> a time for both working and stopping <eos> for men to make money , for you to make honey <eos> and for me to keep constantly hopping <eos>

since last i saw that countenance so mild <eos> slow stealing age , and a faint line of care <eos> had gently touched , methought , some features there <eos> yet looked the man as placid as a child <eos> and the same voice ,— whilst mingled with the throng <eos> unknowing , and unknown , we passed along <eos> that voice , a share of the brief time beguiled <eos> that voice i ne'er may hear again , i sighed <eos> at parting ,— wheresoe'er our various way <eos> in this great world ,— but from the banks of tweed <eos> as slowly sink the shades of eventide <eos> oh ! i shall hear the music of his reed <eos> far off , and thinking of that voice , shall say <eos> a blessing rest upon thy locks of gray <eos>

poor soul the centre of my sinful earth <eos> my sinful earth these rebel powers array <eos> why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth <eos> painting thy outward walls so costly gay <eos> why so large cost having so short a lease <eos> dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend <eos> shall worms inheritors of this excess <eos> eat up thy charge ? is this thy body 's end <eos> then soul live thou upon thy servant 's loss <eos> and let that pine to aggravate thy store <eos> buy terms divine in selling hours of dross <eos> within be fed , without be rich no more <eos> so shall thou feed on death , that feeds on men <eos> and death once dead , there 's no more dying then <eos>
maids shout to breakfast in a merry strife <eos> and the cat runs to hear the whetted knife <eos> and dogs are ever in the way to watch <eos> the mouldy crust and falling bone to catch <eos> the wooden dishes round in haste are set <eos> and round the table all the boys are met <eos> all know their own save hodge who would be first <eos> but every one his master leaves the worst <eos> on every wooden dish , a humble claim <eos> two rude cut letters mark the owner 's name <eos> from every nook the smile of plenty calls <eos> and rusty flitches decorate the walls <eos> moore 's almanack where wonders never cease <eos> all smeared with candle snuff and bacon grease <eos>

meantime the train , proceeding on their way <eos> from far the town and lofty tow'rs survey <eos> at length approach the walls . without the gate <eos> they see the boys and latian youth debate <eos> the martial prizes on the dusty plain <eos> some drive the cars , and some the coursers rein <eos> some bend the stubborn bow for victory <eos> and some with darts their active sinews try <eos> a posting messenger , dispatch 'd from hence <eos> of this fair troop advis 'd their aged prince <eos> that foreign men of mighty stature came <eos> uncouth their habit , and unknown their name <eos> the king ordains their entrance , and ascends <eos> his regal seat , surrounded by his friends <eos>

thee i invoke , the lord of life and light <eos> beyond imagination pure and bright <eos> to thee , sufficing praise no tongue can give <eos> we are thy creatures , and in thee we live <eos> thou art the summit , depth , the all in all <eos> creator , guardian of this earthly ball <eos> whatever is , thou art — protector , king <eos> from thee all goodness , truth , and mercy spring <eos> o pardon the misdeeds of him who now <eos> bends in thy presence with a suppliant brow <eos> teach them to tread the path thy prophet trod <eos> to wash his heart from sin , to know his god <eos> and gently lead him to that home of rest <eos> where filled with holiest rapture dwell the blest <eos>
o melancholy bird , a winter 's day <eos> thou standest by the margin of the pool <eos> and , taught by god , dost thy whole being school <eos> to patience , which all evil can allay <eos> god has appointed thee the fish thy prey <eos> and given thyself a lesson to the fool <eos> unthrifty , to submit to moral rule <eos> and his unthinking course by thee to weigh <eos> there need not schools , nor the professor 's chair <eos> though these be good , true wisdom to impart <eos> he , who has not enough for these to spare <eos> of time , or gold , may yet amend his heart <eos> and teach his soul , by brooks and rivers fair <eos> nature is always wise in every part <eos>
as the lone , frighted user of a night road <eos> suddenly turns round , nothing to detect <eos> yet on his fear ’ s sense keepeth still the load <eos> of that brink nothing he doth but suspect <eos> and the cold terror moves to him more near <eos> of something that from nothing casts a spell <eos> that , when he moves , to fright more is not there <eos> and ’ s only visible when invisible <eos> so i upon the world turn round in thought <eos> and nothing viewing do no courage take <eos> but my more terror , from no seen cause got <eos> to that felt corporate emptiness forsake <eos> and draw my sense of mystery ’ s horror from <eos> seeing no mystery ’ s mystery alone <eos>
woe for thee , babylon !— thy men of might <eos> shall fall unhonoured in the sanguine fight <eos> like the chased roe thy hosts disordered fly <eos> and those who turn to strive but turn to die <eos> thy young men tremble and thy maids grow pale <eos> and swell with frantic grief thy funeral wail <eos> they kneel for mercy , but they sue in vain <eos> their beauty withers on the gore dyed plain <eos> with fathers , lovers , brothers , meet their doom <eos> and ‘ mid thy blackened ruins find a tomb <eos> of fear unconscious , in soft slumbers blest <eos> the infant dies upon its mother 's breast <eos> unpitied e'en by her — the hand that gave <eos> the blow has sent the parent to the grave <eos>
the breed 's described : now , satire , if you can <eos> their temper show , for manners make the man <eos> fierce as the briton , as the roman brave <eos> and less inclined to conquer than to save <eos> eager to fight , and lavish of their blood <eos> and equally of fear and forecast void <eos> the pict has made them sour , the dane morose <eos> false from the scot , and from the norman worse <eos> what honesty they have , the saxon gave them <eos> and that , now they grow old , begins to leave them <eos> the climate makes them terrible and bold <eos> and english beef their courage does uphold <eos> no danger can their daring spirit dull <eos> always provided when their belly 's full <eos>
sweet summer queen , with trailing robe of green <eos> what spell has thou to bind the heart to thee <eos> thy throne is built upon the sun lit sea <eos> where break the waves in clouds of silver sheen <eos> and oft at dawn like some resplendent queen <eos> thou sittest on the hills in majesty <eos> and all the flowers wake at thy decree <eos> but now farewell to all thy joys serene <eos> the autumn comes with swift winged , silent flight <eos> and he will woo thee with his fiery breath <eos> in crimson robes and hues of flashing gold <eos> he 'll clothe thee , and thy beauty in the night <eos> will take a richer glow . but wintry death <eos> will come and wrap thee in his fold <eos>
beloved moment ! then ‘ twas first i caught <eos> the first foundation of romantic thought <eos> then first i shed bold fancy 's thrilling tear <eos> then first that poesy charm 'd mine infant ear <eos> soon stored with much of legendary lore <eos> the sports of childhood charm 'd my soul no more <eos> far from the scene of gaiety and noise <eos> far , far from turbulent and empty joys <eos> i hied me to the thick overarching shade <eos> and there , on mossy carpet , listless laid <eos> while at my feet the rippling runnel ran <eos> the days of wild romance antique i 'd scan <eos> soar on the wings of fancy through the air <eos> to realms of light , and pierce the radiance there <eos>
the rolling wheele that runneth often round <eos> the hardest steele , in tract of time doth teare <eos> and drizling drops , that often doe redound <eos> the firmest flint doth in continuance weare <eos> yet cannot i , with many a drooping teare <eos> and long intreaty , soften her hard hart <eos> that she will once vouchsafe my plaint to heare <eos> or looke with pitty on my payneful smart <eos> but when i pleade , she bids me play my part <eos> and when i weep , she sayes , teares are but water <eos> and when i sigh , she sayes , i know the art <eos> and when i waile , she turnes hir selfe to laughter <eos> so do i weepe , and wayle , and pleade in vaine <eos> whiles she as steele and flint doth still remayne <eos>

o true , they have a cause , and woe for us <eos> while still they have a cause too piteous <eos> yet , happy for us when , their cause defined <eos> they walk no longer with a stumbler blind <eos> and quicken in the virtue of their cause <eos> to think me a poor mouther of old saws <eos> i wait the issue of a battling age <eos> the toilers with your “ troughsters ” now engage <eos> instructing them through their acutest sense <eos> how close the dangers of indifference <eos> already have my people shown their worth <eos> more love they light , which folds the love of earth <eos> that love to love of labour leads : thence love <eos> of humankind — earth 's incense flung above <eos>

then all the lords and ladies rubbed their eyes <eos> and slowly roused themselves from dumb surprise <eos> the great hall echoed once more with the clatter <eos> of laughing men 's and frightened women 's chatter <eos> but gawayne , with the axe in hand , stood still <eos> heedless of what was passing , with no will <eos> for life or death , for all that made life dear <eos> was fled like summer when the leaves fall sere <eos> and arthur spoke , misreading gawayne 's thought <eos> “ heaven send we have not all too dearly bought <eos> our evening 's pastime , gawayne . you have done <eos> as fits a fearless knight , and nobly won <eos> our thanks in equal measure with our praise <eos> be both remembered in the after days <eos>

as when it happ'neth that some lovely town <eos> unto a barbarous besieger falls <eos> who both by sword and flame himself installs <eos> and , shameless , it in tears and blood doth drown <eos> her beauty spoil 'd , her citizens made thralls <eos> his spite yet cannot so her all throw down <eos> but that some statue , pillar of renown <eos> yet lurks unmaim 'd within her weeping walls <eos> so , after all the spoil , disgrace , and wreck <eos> that time , the world , and death , could bring combined <eos> amidst that mass of ruins they did make <eos> safe and all scarless yet remains my mind <eos> from this so high transcending rapture springs <eos> that i , all else defaced , not envy kings <eos>
that you were once unkind befriends me now <eos> and for that sorrow , which i then did feel <eos> needs must i under my transgression bow <eos> unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel <eos> for if you were by my unkindness shaken <eos> as i by yours , y'have passed a hell of time <eos> and i a tyrant have no leisure taken <eos> to weigh how once i suffered in your crime <eos> o that our night of woe might have remembered <eos> my deepest sense , how hard true sorrow hits <eos> and soon to you , as you to me then tendered <eos> the humble salve , which wounded bosoms fits <eos> but that your trespass now becomes a fee <eos> mine ransoms yours , and yours must ransom me <eos>
she stood before her traitors bound and bare <eos> clothed with her wounds and with her naked shame <eos> as with a weed of fiery tears and flame <eos> their mother land , their common weal and care <eos> and they turned from her and denied , and sware <eos> they did not know this woman nor her name <eos> and they took truce with tyrants and grew tame <eos> and gathered up cast crowns and creeds to wear <eos> and rags and shards regilded . then she took <eos> in her bruised hands their broken pledge , and eyed <eos> these men so late so loud upon her side <eos> with one inevitable and tearless look <eos> that they might see her face whom they forsook <eos> and they beheld what they had left , and died <eos>
the peasant ‘ gan to turn things in his mind <eos> said he , to take the heads i 'm not inclined <eos> no drink , you say , between ; that makes it worse <eos> to eat the garlick thus , would prove a curse <eos> nor can i suffer on my tender back <eos> that , with a cudgel , thirty blows you thwack <eos> still harder thirty pounds to pay appeared <eos> uncertain how to act , he hanging feared <eos> the noble peer he begged , upon his knees <eos> his penitence to hear , and sentence ease <eos> but mercy dwelled not with the angry lord <eos> is this , cried he , the answer ?— bring a cord <eos> the peasant , trembling lest his life was sought <eos> the garlick chose , which presently was brought <eos>
how like a winter hath my absence been <eos> from thee , the pleasure of the fleeting year <eos> what freezings have i felt , what dark days seen <eos> what old december 's bareness everywhere <eos> and yet this time removed was summer 's time <eos> the teeming autumn big with rich increase <eos> bearing the wanton burden of the prime <eos> like widowed wombs after their lords ’ decease <eos> yet this abundant issue seemed to me <eos> but hope of orphans , and unfathered fruit <eos> for summer and his pleasures wait on thee <eos> and thou away , the very birds are mute <eos> or if they sing , ‘ tis with so dull a cheer <eos> that leaves look pale , dreading the winter 's near <eos>
who will believe my verse in time to come <eos> if it were filled with your most high deserts <eos> though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb <eos> which hides your life , and shows not half your parts <eos> if i could write the beauty of your eyes <eos> and in fresh numbers number all your graces <eos> the age to come would say this poet lies <eos> such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces <eos> so should my papers ( yellowed with their age <eos> be scorned , like old men of less truth than tongue <eos> and your true rights be termed a poet 's rage <eos> and stretched metre of an antique song <eos> but were some child of yours alive that time <eos> you should live twice in it , and in my rhyme <eos>

timid and smiling , beautiful and shy <eos> she drops her head at every passer bye <eos> afraid of praise she hurries down the streets <eos> and turns away from every smile she meets <eos> the forward clown has many things to say <eos> and holds her by the gown to make her stay <eos> the picture of good health she goes along <eos> hale as the morn and happy as her song <eos> yet there is one who never feels a fear <eos> to whisper pleasing fancies in her ear <eos> yet een from him she shuns a rude embrace <eos> and stooping holds her hands before her face <eos> she even shuns and fears the bolder wind <eos> and holds her shawl , and often looks behind <eos>
“ smooth roll 'd my vernal years , while on my head <eos> fate 's early smiles a meteor lustre shed <eos> no painful fear , no troubles , then had power <eos> to break the current of one peaceful hour <eos> oft as i trod the meadow 's verdant round <eos> or pierced the echoing forest 's gloomy bound <eos> or traced the willowy margin of the stream <eos> lost in the wildering maze of fancy 's dream <eos> before me life 's long years in prospect rose <eos> by fears unbroken , undisturb 'd by woes <eos> yes ! i remember well ,— my dizzy brain <eos> feels those bright hours not yet effaced by pain <eos> still on my soul they cast a distant light <eos> and gild with transitory gleams the night <eos>
friend of my peaceful days ! substantial friend <eos> whom wealth can never change , nor int'rest bend <eos> i love thee like a child . thou wert to me <eos> the dumb companion of my misery <eos> and oftner of my joys ;— then as i spoke <eos> i shar 'd thy sympathy , old heart of oak <eos> for surely when my labour ceas 'd at night <eos> with trembling , feverish hands , and aching sight <eos> the draught that cheer 'd me and subdu 'd my care <eos> on thy broad shoulders thou wert proud to bear <eos> o'er thee , with expectation 's fire elate <eos> i 've sat and ponder 'd on my future fate <eos> on thee , with winter muffins for thy store <eos> i 've lean 'd , and quite forgot that i was poor <eos>
i say unto all hearts that cannot rest <eos> for want of love , for beating loud and lonely <eos> pray the great mercy god to give you only <eos> love that is passionless within the breast <eos> pray that it may not be a haunting fire <eos> a vision that shall steal insatiably <eos> all beauteous content , all sweet desire <eos> from faith and dream , star , flower , and song , and sea <eos> but seek that soul and soul may meet together <eos> knowing they have forever been but one <eos> meet and be surest when ill 's chartless weather <eos> drives blinding gales of doubt across their sun <eos> pray — pray ! lost love uptorn shall seem as nether <eos> hell hate and rage beyond oblivion <eos>
there valor fronts us with her storied shield <eos> brave in devices won on many a field <eos> a splendid wreath snatched from the carnage grim <eos> is twined around that buckler 's burnished rim <eos> and as we gaze , the brazen trumpets blare <eos> with shrill vibration shakes the frightened air <eos> the roll of musketry — the clash of steel <eos> the clang of hoofs as charging squadrons wheel <eos> the hoarse command — the imprecative cry <eos> swell loud and long , while fancy 's eager eye <eos> sees the stern van move on with crimson strides <eos> where freedom 's warrior on his war horse rides <eos> sees the great cannon flash out red and fast <eos> through battle mists which canopy the past <eos>
“ an upstart multitude and sudden gains <eos> pride and excess , o florence ! have in thee <eos> engender 'd , so that now in tears thou mourn'st <eos> thus cried i with my face uprais 'd , and they <eos> all three , who for an answer took my words <eos> look 'd at each other , as men look when truth <eos> comes to their ear . “ if thou at other times <eos> they all at once rejoin 'd , “ so easily <eos> satisfy those , who question , happy thou <eos> gifted with words , so apt to speak thy thought <eos> wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime <eos> returning to behold the radiant stars <eos> when thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past <eos> see that of us thou speak among mankind <eos>
to one who has been long in city pent <eos> ‘ tis very sweet to look into the fair <eos> and open face of heaven ,— to breathe a prayer <eos> full in the smile of the blue firmament <eos> who is more happy , when , with hearts content <eos> fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair <eos> of wavy grass , and reads a debonair <eos> and gentle tale of love and languishment <eos> returning home at evening , with an ear <eos> catching the notes of philomel ,— an eye <eos> watching the sailing cloudlet 's bright career <eos> he mourns that day so soon has glided by <eos> e'en like the passage of an angel 's tear <eos> that falls through the clear ether silently <eos>

a rose , as fair as ever saw the north <eos> grew in a little garden all alone <eos> a sweeter flower did nature ne'er put forth <eos> nor fairer garden yet was never known <eos> the maidens danced about it morn and noon <eos> and learned bards of it their ditties made <eos> the nimble fairies by the pale faced moon <eos> watered the root and kissed her pretty shade <eos> but well a day !— the gardener careless grew <eos> the maids and fairies both were kept away <eos> and in a drought the caterpillars threw <eos> themselves upon the bud and every spray <eos> god shield the stock ! if heaven send no supplies <eos> the fairest blossom of the garden dies <eos>
straight from the sun 's grave in the deep clear west <eos> a sweet strong wind blows , glad of life : and i <eos> under the soft keen stardawn whence the sky <eos> takes life renewed , and all night 's godlike breast <eos> palpitates , gradually revealed at rest <eos> by growth and change of ardours felt on high <eos> make onward , till the last flame fall and die <eos> and all the world by night 's broad hand lie blest <eos> haply , meseems , as from that edge of death <eos> whereon the day lies dark , a brightening breath <eos> blows more of benediction than the morn <eos> so from the graves whereon grief gazing saith <eos> that half our heart of life there lies forlorn <eos> may light or breath at least of hope be born <eos>
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes <eos> and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he <eos> remembered in what a haughtier guise <eos> he had flung an alms to leprosie <eos> when he girt his young life up in gilded mail <eos> and set forth in search of the holy grail <eos> the heart within him was ashes and dust <eos> he parted in twain his single crust <eos> he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink <eos> and gave the leper to eat and drink <eos> ‘ twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread <eos> ‘ twas water out of a wooden bowl <eos> yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed <eos> and ‘ twas red wine he drank with his thirsty soul <eos>
‘ tis best sometimes your censure to restrain <eos> and charitably let the dull be vain <eos> your silence there is better than your spite <eos> for who can rail so long as they can write <eos> still humming on , their drowsy course they keep <eos> and lashed so long like tops are lashed asleep <eos> false steps but help them to renew the race <eos> as after stumbling , jades will mend their pace <eos> what crowds of these , impenitently bold <eos> in sounds and jingling syllables grown old <eos> still run on poets in a raging vein <eos> even to the dregs and squeezing of the brain <eos> strain out the last dull droppings of their sense <eos> and rhyme with all the rage of impotence <eos>
lear and cordelia ! ‘ twas an ancient tale <eos> before thy shakespeare gave it deathless fame <eos> the times have changed , the moral is the same <eos> so like an outcast , dowerless and pale <eos> thy daughter went ; and in a foreign gale <eos> spread her young banner , till its sway became <eos> a wonder to the nations . days of shame <eos> are close upon thee ; prophets raise their wail <eos> when the rude cossack with an outstretched hand <eos> points his long spear across the narrow sea <eos> “ lo ! there is england ! ” when thy destiny <eos> storms on thy straw crowned head , and thou dost stand <eos> weak , helpless , mad , a by word in the land <eos> god grant thy daughter a cordelia be <eos>
or dost thou mourn that the house of god <eos> has ceased to be a divine abode <eos> that the holy spirit , which erst did brood <eos> o'er the son of man by jordan 's flood <eos> in thine own pure form to the eye of sense <eos> from its resting place has departed hence <eos> and twitters the swallow , and wheels the bat <eos> o'er the mercy seat where its presence sat <eos> i have marked thy trembling breast , and heard <eos> with a heart responsive thy tones , sweet bird <eos> and have mourned , like thee , of earth 's fairest things <eos> the blight and the loss — oh ! had i thy wings <eos> from a world of woe to the realms of the blest <eos> i would flee away , and would be at rest <eos>
guard thou , my son , the helpless and the poor <eos> nor in the chains of thine own indolence <eos> slumber enervate , while the joys of sense <eos> engross thee ; and thou say'st , “ i ask no more <eos> wise men the shepherd 's slumber will deplore <eos> when the rapacious wolf has leapt the fence <eos> and ranges thro ’ the fold .— my son , dispense <eos> those laws , that justice to the wrong 'd restore <eos> the common weal shou 'd be the first pursuit <eos> of the crown 'd warrior , for the royal brows <eos> the people first enwreath 'd .— they are the root <eos> the king the tree . aloft he spreads his boughs <eos> glorious ; but learn , impetuous youth , at length <eos> trees from the root alone derive their strength <eos>
low mourned the oread round the arcadian hills <eos> the naiad murmured and the dryad moaned <eos> the meadow maiden left her daffodils <eos> to join the hamadryades who groaned <eos> over a sister newly fallen dead <eos> that life might perish out of arcady <eos> from immemorial times was never said <eos> yet here one lay dead by her dead oak tree <eos> “ who made our hamadryad cold and mute <eos> the others cried in sorrow and in wonder <eos> “ i , ” answered death , close by in ashen suit <eos> “ yet fear not me for this , nor start asunder <eos> arcadian life shall keep its ancient zest <eos> though i be here . my name ?— is it not rest <eos>
around her grew a stillness unto death <eos> the waves their ever restless motion stayed <eos> all living nature seemed to hold its breath <eos> as if by some stupendous power o'erweighed <eos> and right athwart the sunset 's fading glow <eos> a great black cloud , like some huge monstrous thing <eos> threw round and round the sun 's last dipping ring <eos> the impress of its shadow drooping low <eos> and lower , lower fell that mighty cloud <eos> with menacing shape as in defiance proud <eos> until at last all sky and earth and sea <eos> seemed filled with shadows from its darkening wings <eos> that dreadful spell cast over waves once free <eos> hushed into silence deep all living things <eos>
one day , whiles that my daylie cares did sleepe <eos> my spirit , shaking off her earthly prison <eos> began to enter into meditation deepe <eos> of things exceeding reach of common reason <eos> such as this age , in which all good is geason <eos> and all that humble is and meane ** debaced <eos> hath brought forth in her last declining season <eos> griefe of good mindes , to see goodnesse disgraced <eos> on which when as my thought was throghly @ placed <eos> unto my eyes strange showes presented were <eos> picturing that which i in minde embraced <eos> that yet those sights empassion $ me full nere <eos> such as they were , faire ladie %, take in worth <eos> that when time serves may bring things better forth <eos>
rend hearts and rend not garments for our sins <eos> gird sackcloth not on body but on soul <eos> grovel in dust with faces toward the goal <eos> nor won , nor neared : he only laughs who wins <eos> not neared the goal , the race too late begins <eos> or left undone , we have yet to do the whole <eos> the sun is hurrying west and toward the pole <eos> where darkness waits for earth with all her kins <eos> let us to day , while it is called to day <eos> set out , if utmost speed may yet avail <eos> the shadows lengthen and the light grows pale <eos> for who through darkness and the shadow of death <eos> darkness that may be felt , shall find a way <eos> blind eyed , deaf eared , and choked with failing breath <eos>
so , silence reconciles life 's jarring phrases <eos> far in the future , austere and august <eos> meanwhile , the buds of the poplars are falling <eos> spring 's on the lawn , and a little voice calling <eos> “ daddy , come out ! daddy darling , you must <eos> daddy come out and help molly pick daisies <eos> and , since one 's here , and the spring 's in the garden <eos> ( how many lives hence will that thought earn pardon <eos> since one 's a man and man 's heart is insistent <eos> and , since nirvana is doubtful and distant <eos> though life 's a hard road and thorny to travel <eos> stones in the borders and grass on the gravel <eos> still there 's the wisdom that wise men call folly <eos> still one can go and pick daisies with molly <eos>
not that thy hand is soft , is sweet , is white <eos> thy lips sweet roses , breast sweet lily is <eos> that love esteems these three the chiefest bliss <eos> which nature ever made for lips ’ delight <eos> but when these three to show their heavenly might <eos> such wonders do , devotion then for this <eos> commandeth us with humble zeal to kiss <eos> such things as work miracles in our sight <eos> a lute of senseless wood , by nature dumb <eos> touched by thy hand doth speak divinely well <eos> and from thy lips and breast sweet tunes do come <eos> to my dead heart , the which new life do give <eos> of greater wonders heard we never tell <eos> than for the dumb to speak , the dead to live <eos>
shout , for a mighty victory is won <eos> on british ground the invaders are laid low <eos> the breath of heaven has drifted them like snow <eos> and left them lying in the silent sun <eos> never to rise again !— the work is done <eos> come forth , ye old men , now in peaceful show <eos> and greet your sons ! drums beat , and trumpets blow <eos> make merry , wives ! ye little children stun <eos> your grandame 's ears with pleasure of your noise <eos> clap , infants , clap your hands ! divine must be <eos> that triumph , when the very worst , the pain <eos> and even the prospect of our brethren slain <eos> hath something in it which the heart enjoys <eos> in glory will they sleep and endless sanctity <eos>
did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye <eos> ‘ gainst whom the world could not hold argument <eos> persuade my heart to this false perjury <eos> vows for thee broke deserve not punishment <eos> a woman i forswore ; but i will prove <eos> thou being a goddess , i forswore not thee <eos> my vow was earthly , thou a heavenly love <eos> thy grace being gain 'd cures all disgrace in me <eos> my vow was breath , and breath a vapour is <eos> then , thou fair sun , that on this earth doth shine <eos> exhale this vapour vow ; in thee it is <eos> if broken , then it is no fault of mine <eos> if by me broke , what fool is not so wise <eos> to break an oath , to win a paradise <eos>
one looks into the sun lawn , and the steep <eos> curved slopes of hills , set sharp against the sky <eos> with tufted woods encinctured , waving high <eos> o'er vales below , where broken shadows sleep <eos> here , looking forth before the first faint cry <eos> of mother bird , fluttering a drowsy wing <eos> above her brood , awakes the full voiced choir <eos> ere yet the morning tips the hills with fire <eos> and turns the drapery of the east to gold <eos> my wondering eyes the opening heavens behold <eos> where far within deep calleth unto deep <eos> and the whole world stands hushed and worshipping <eos> even thus ,— i muse ,— shall heaven 's gates unfold <eos> when earth beholds the coming of her king <eos>
the weary old year is dead at last <eos> his corpse ‘ mid the ruins of time is cast <eos> where the mouldering wrecks of lost thought lie <eos> and the rich hued blossoms of passion die <eos> to a withering grass that droops o'er his grave <eos> the shadowy titan 's refuge cave <eos> strange lights from pale moony memory lie <eos> on the weedy columns beneath its eye <eos> and strange is the sound of the ghostlike breeze <eos> in the lingering leaves on the skeleton trees <eos> and strange is the sound of the falling shower <eos> when the clouds of dead pain o'er the spirit lower <eos> unheard in the home he inhabiteth <eos> the land where all lost things are gathered by death <eos>
with fierce regard achilles answer 'd thus <eos> “ hector , thou object of my deadly hate <eos> talk not to me of compacts ; as ‘ tween men <eos> and lions no firm concord can exist <eos> nor wolves and lambs in harmony unite <eos> but ceaseless enmity between them dwells <eos> so not in friendly terms , nor compact firm <eos> can thou and i unite , till one of us <eos> glut with his blood the mail clad warrior mars <eos> mind thee of all thy fence ; behoves thee now <eos> to prove a spearman skill 'd , and warrior brave <eos> for thee escape is none ; now , by my spear <eos> hath pallas doom 'd thy death ; my comrades ’ blood <eos> which thou hast shed , shall all be now aveng 'd <eos>

mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled <eos> thy beauty 's form in table of my heart <eos> my body is the frame wherein ‘ tis held <eos> and perspective it is best painter 's art <eos> for through the painter must you see his skill <eos> to find where your true image pictured lies <eos> which in my bosom 's shop is hanging still <eos> that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes <eos> now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done <eos> mine eyes have drawn thy shape , and thine for me <eos> are windows to my breast , where through the sun <eos> delights to peep , to gaze therein on thee <eos> yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art <eos> they draw but what they see , know not the heart <eos>
i hate the very noise of troublous man <eos> who did and does me all the harm he can <eos> free from the world i would a prisoner be <eos> and my own shadow all my company <eos> and lonely see the shooting stars appear <eos> worlds rushing into judgment all the year <eos> o lead me onward to the loneliest shade <eos> the darkest place that quiet ever made <eos> where kingcups grow most beauteous to behold <eos> and shut up green and open into gold <eos> farewell to poesy — and leave the will <eos> take all the world away — and leave me still <eos> the mirth and music of a woman 's voice <eos> that bids the heart be happy and rejoice <eos>
thus vulcan spoke : and rising with a bound <eos> the double bowl with sparkling nectar crown ’ d <eos> which held to juno in a cheerful way <eos> “ goddess ( he cried ) , be patient and obey <eos> dear as you are , if jove his arm extend <eos> i can but grieve , unable to defend <eos> what god so daring in your aid to move <eos> or lift his hand against the force of jove <eos> once in your cause i felt his matchless might <eos> hurl ’ d headlong down from the ethereal height <eos> toss ’ d all the day in rapid circles round <eos> nor till the sun descended touch ’ d the ground <eos> breathless i fell , in giddy motion lost <eos> the sinthians raised me on the lemnian coast <eos>
the combat ceased , the thunder birds had won <eos> the water demon with one favorite son <eos> fled from the carnage and escaped our wrath <eos> the vapors , thinly curling from the shore <eos> faint musky odors to our nostrils bore <eos> the air was stilled , the silence of the dead <eos> the sun , just starting on his downward path <eos> a rosy mantle o'er the prairie shed <eos> save where , like vultures , ominous and still <eos> we clustered close , on sullen wings outspread <eos> and sometimes , with a momentary chill <eos> a giant shadow swept o'er plain and hill <eos> a thunder bird careering overhead <eos> seeking the track by which the foe had fled <eos>
them virgil answer 'd . “ ye suppose perchance <eos> us well acquainted with this place : but here <eos> we , as yourselves , are strangers . not long erst <eos> we came , before you but a little space <eos> by other road so rough and hard , that now <eos> the ’ ascent will seem to us as play . ” the spirits <eos> who from my breathing had perceiv 'd i liv 'd <eos> grew pale with wonder . as the multitude <eos> flock round a herald , sent with olive branch <eos> to hear what news he brings , and in their haste <eos> tread one another down , e'en so at sight <eos> of me those happy spirits were fix 'd , each one <eos> forgetful of its errand , to depart <eos> where cleans 'd from sin , it might be made all fair <eos>
beloved , thou hast brought me many flowers <eos> plucked in the garden , all the summer through <eos> and winter , and it seemed as if they grew <eos> in this close room , nor missed the sun and showers <eos> so , in the like name of that love of ours <eos> take back these thoughts which here unfolded too <eos> and which on warm and cold days i withdrew <eos> from my heart 's ground . indeed , those beds and bowers <eos> be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue <eos> and wait thy weeding ; yet here 's eglantine <eos> here 's ivy !— take them , as i used to do <eos> thy flowers , and keep them where they shall not pine <eos> instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true <eos> and tell thy soul , their roots are left in mine <eos>
and lest , by length of time , it be pretended <eos> the climate may this modern breed have mended <eos> wise providence , to keep us where we are <eos> mixes us daily with exceeding care <eos> we have been europe 's sink , the jakes , where she <eos> voids all her offal out cast progeny <eos> from our fifth henry 's time the strolling bands <eos> of banish 'd fugitives from neighb'ring lands <eos> have here a certain sanctuary found <eos> the eternal refuge of the vagabond <eos> where in but half a common age of time <eos> borrowing new blood and manners from the clime <eos> proudly they learn all mankind to contemn <eos> and all their race are true born englishmen <eos>
the shivering wind sits in the oaks , whose limbs <eos> twisted and tortured , nevermore are still <eos> grief and decay sit with it ; they , whose chill <eos> autumnal touch makes hectic red the rims <eos> of all the oak leaves ; desolating , dims <eos> the ageratum 's blue that banks the rill <eos> and splits the milkweed 's pod upon the hill <eos> and shakes it free of the last seed that swims <eos> down goes the day despondent to its close <eos> and now the sunset 's hands of copper build <eos> a tower of brass , behind whose burning bars <eos> the day , in fierce , barbarian repose <eos> like some imprisoned inca sits , hate filled <eos> crowned with the gold corymbus of the stars <eos>
and thou , my village ! as again i tread <eos> amidst thy living and above thy dead <eos> though some fair playmates guard with charter fears <eos> their cheeks , grown holy with the lapse of years <eos> though with the dust some reverend locks may blend <eos> where life 's last mile stone marks the journey 's end <eos> on every bud the changing year recalls <eos> the brightening glance of morning memory falls <eos> still following onward as the months unclose <eos> the balmy lilac or the bridal rose <eos> and still shall follow , till they sink once more <eos> beneath the snow drifts of the frozen shore <eos> as when my bark , long tossing in the gale <eos> furled in her port her tempest rended sail <eos>
what matters it to me , whose countenance <eos> is like the laocoon 's , full of pain ; whose forehead <eos> is a ploughed harvest field , where three score years <eos> have sown in sorrow and have reaped in anguish <eos> to me , the artisan , to whom all women <eos> have been as if they were not , or at most <eos> a sudden rush of pigeons in the air <eos> a flutter of wings , a sound , and then a silence <eos> i am too old for love ; i am too old <eos> to flatter and delude myself with visions <eos> of never ending friendship with fair women <eos> imaginations , fantasies , illusions <eos> in which the things that cannot be take shape <eos> and seem to be , and for the moment are <eos>
on a swift sailing vessel 's stern , that bore <eos> protesilaus to the coast of troy <eos> but to his native country bore not thence <eos> hector had laid his hand ; around that ship <eos> trojans and greeks in mutual slaughter join 'd <eos> the arrow 's or the jav'lin ' s distant flight <eos> they waited not , but , fir 'd with equal rage <eos> fought hand to hand , with axe and hatchet keen <eos> and mighty swords , and double pointed spears <eos> many a fair hilted blade , with iron bound <eos> dropp 'd from the hands , or from the sever 'd arms <eos> of warrior chiefs ; the dark earth ran with blood <eos> yet loos 'd not hector of the stern his hold <eos> but grasp 'd the poop , and on the trojans call 'd <eos>
feronde , a rich , but awkward , vulgar clown <eos> a ninny was believed throughout the town <eos> he had the charge of revenues not slight <eos> which he collected for a friar white <eos> of these i 've known as good as any black <eos> when husbands some assistance seemed to lack <eos> and had so much to do , they monks might need <eos> or other friends , their work at home to speed <eos> this friar for to morrow never thought <eos> but squandered ev'ry thing as soon as brought <eos> no saint apostle less of wealth retained <eos> good cheer o'er ev'ry wish triumphant reigned <eos> save now and then to have a little fun <eos> ( unknown to others ) with a pretty nun <eos>
because a steadfast flame of clear intent <eos> gave force and beauty to full actioned life <eos> because his way was one of firm ascent <eos> whose stepping stones were hewn of change and strife <eos> because as husband loveth noble wife <eos> he loved fair truth ; because the thing he meant <eos> to do , that thing he did , nor paused , nor bent <eos> in face of poor and pale conclusions ; yea <eos> because of this , how fares the leader dead <eos> what kind of mourners weep for him to day <eos> what golden shroud is at his funeral spread <eos> upon his brow what leaves of laurel , say <eos> about his breast is tied a sackcloth grey <eos> and knots of thorns deface his lordly head <eos>
three men lived yet when this dead man was young <eos> whose names and words endure for ever : one <eos> whose eyes grew dim with straining toward the sun <eos> and his wings weakened , and his angel 's tongue <eos> lost half the sweetest song was ever sung <eos> but like the strain half uttered earth hears none <eos> nor shall man hear till all men 's songs are done <eos> one whose clear spirit like an eagle hung <eos> between the mountains hallowed by his love <eos> and the sky stainless as his soul above <eos> and one the sweetest heart that ever spake <eos> the brightest words wherein sweet wisdom smiled <eos> these deathless names by this dead snake defiled <eos> bid memory spit upon him for their sake <eos>
what do we see ? is cato then become <eos> a greater name in britain than in rome <eos> does mankind now admire his virtues more <eos> though lucan , horace , virgil , wrote before <eos> how will posterity this truth explain <eos> “ cato begins to live in anna ’ s reign <eos> the world ’ s great chiefs , in council or in arms <eos> rise in your lines with more exalted charms <eos> illustrious deeds in distant nations wrought <eos> and virtues by departed heroes taught <eos> raise in your soul a pure immortal flame <eos> adorn your life , and consecrate your fame <eos> to your renown all ages you subdue <eos> and c æ sar fought , and cato bled for you <eos>
my god , my god , how much i love my goddess <eos> whose virtues rare , unto the heavens arise <eos> my god , my god , how much i love her eyes <eos> one shining bright , the other full of hardness <eos> my god , my god , how much i love her wisdom <eos> whose works may ravish heaven 's richest maker <eos> of whose eyes ’ joys if i might be partaker <eos> then to my soul a holy rest would come <eos> my god , how much i love to hear her speak <eos> whose hands i kiss and ravished oft rekisseth <eos> when she stands wotless whom so much she blesseth <eos> say then , what mind this honest love would break <eos> since her perfections pure , withouten blot <eos> makes her beloved of thee , she knoweth not <eos>
ah , woe is me for pleasure that is vain <eos> ah , woe is me for glory that is past <eos> pleasure that bringeth sorrow at the last <eos> glory that at the last bringeth no gain <eos> so saith the sinking heart ; and so again <eos> it shall say till the mighty angel blast <eos> is blown , making the sun and moon aghast <eos> and showering down the stars like sudden rain <eos> and evermore men shall go fearfully <eos> bending beneath their weight of heaviness <eos> and ancient men shall lie down wearily <eos> and strong men shall rise up in weariness <eos> yea , even the young shall answer sighingly <eos> saying one to another : how vain it is <eos>
meanwhile , however , while thus the lady sought <eos> by ev'ry charm to please , a note was brought <eos> a page conveyed it , by the marquis sent <eos> to say his coming business would prevent <eos> the disappointment doubtless was severe <eos> but consolation certainly was near <eos> it proved to reynold wonderfully kind <eos> for scarcely had our traveller resigned <eos> and groaned aloud , but , tender as her dame <eos> in haste the confidential servant came <eos> and to the widow said :— i hear below <eos> some poor unfortunate o'ercome with woe <eos> ‘ tis piercing cold , and he perhaps will die <eos> some place , pray grant , where he to night may lie <eos>
i thank all who have loved me in their hearts <eos> with thanks and love from mine . deep thanks to all <eos> who paused a little near the prison wall <eos> to hear my music in its louder parts <eos> ere they went onward , each one to the mart 's <eos> or temple 's occupation , beyond call <eos> but thou , who , in my voice 's sink and fall <eos> when the sob took it , thy divinest art 's <eos> own instrument didst drop down at thy foot <eos> to harken what i said between my tears <eos> instruct me how to thank thee ! oh , to shoot <eos> my soul 's full meaning into future years <eos> that they should lend it utterance , and salute <eos> love that endures , from life that disappears <eos>
so long as ioves great bird did make his flight <eos> bearing the fire with which heaven doth us fray <eos> heaven had not feare of that presumptuous might <eos> with which the giaunts did the gods assay <eos> but all so soone as scortching sunne had brent <eos> his wings which wont the earth to overspredd <eos> the earth out of her massie wombe forth sent <eos> that antique horror which made heaven adredd <eos> then was the germane raven in disguise <eos> that romane eagle seene to cleave asunder <eos> and towards heaven freshly to arise <eos> out of these mountaines , now consum 'd to pouder <eos> in which the foule that serves to beare the lightning <eos> is now no more seen flying nor alighting <eos>
in wiser days , my darling rosebud , blown <eos> to beauty proud as was your mother 's prime <eos> in that desired , delayed , incredible time <eos> you 'll ask why i abandoned you , my own <eos> and the dear heart that was your baby throne <eos> to dice with death . and oh ! they 'll give you rhyme <eos> and reason : some will call the thing sublime <eos> and some decry it in a knowing tone <eos> so here , while the mad guns curse overhead <eos> and tired men sigh with mud for couch and floor <eos> know that we fools , now with the foolish dead <eos> died not for flag , nor king , nor emperor <eos> but for a dream , born in a herdsman 's shed <eos> and for the secret scripture of the poor <eos>
when men shall find thy flower , thy glory pass <eos> and thou with careful brow sitting alone <eos> receiv è d hast this message from thy glass <eos> that tells the truth , and says that all is gone <eos> fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou mad'st <eos> though spent thy flame , in me the heat remaining <eos> i that have loved thee thus before thou fad'st <eos> my faith shall wax when thou art in thy waning <eos> the world shall find this miracle in me <eos> that fire can burn when all the matter 's spent <eos> then what my faith hath been thyself shalt see <eos> and that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent <eos> thou mayst repent that thou hast scorned my tears <eos> when winter snows upon thy sable hairs <eos>
a remnant from the pitiless strife escaped <eos> entered their stronghold , scarce eluding doom <eos> children and wives from their limbs blood besprent <eos> received their arms bedabbled with foul gore <eos> and baths for all were heated . leeches ran <eos> through all the town in hot haste to the homes <eos> of wounded men to minister to their hurts <eos> here wives and daughters moaned round men come back <eos> from war , there cried on many who came not <eos> here , men stung to the soul by bitter pangs <eos> groaned upon beds of pain ; there , toil spent men <eos> turned them to supper . whinnied the swift steeds <eos> and neighed o'er mangers heaped . by tent and ship <eos> far off the greeks did even as they of troy <eos>
oilean ajax first the voice obey ’ d <eos> swift was his pace , and ready was his aid <eos> next him idomeneus , more slow with age <eos> and merion , burning with a hero ’ s rage <eos> the long succeeding numbers who can name <eos> but all were greeks , and eager all for fame <eos> fierce to the charge great hector led the throng <eos> whole troy embodied rush ’ d with shouts along <eos> thus , when a mountain billow foams and raves <eos> where some swoln river disembogues his waves <eos> full in the mouth is stopp ’ d the rushing tide <eos> the boiling ocean works from side to side <eos> the river trembles to his utmost shore <eos> and distant rocks re bellow to the roar <eos>
pensive within the coliseum 's walls <eos> i stood with thee , o poet of the west <eos> the day when each had been a welcome guest <eos> in san clemente 's venerable halls <eos> with what delight my memory now recalls <eos> that hour of hours , that flower of all the rest <eos> when , with thy white beard falling on thy breast <eos> that noble head , that well might serve as paul 's <eos> in some divinest vision of the saint <eos> by raffael dreamed — i heard thee mourn the dead <eos> the martyred host who fearless there , though faint <eos> walked the rough road that up to heaven 's gate led <eos> these were the pictures calderon loved to paint <eos> in golden hues that here perchance have fled <eos>
i wage the combat with two mighty foes <eos> which are more strong than i ten thousand fold <eos> the one is when thy pleasure i do lose <eos> the other , when thy person i behold <eos> in seeing thee a swarm of loves confound me <eos> and cause my death in spite of my resist <eos> and if i see thee not , thy want doth wound me <eos> for in thy sight my comfort doth consist <eos> the one in me continual care createth <eos> the other doth occasion my desire <eos> the one the edge of all my joy rebateth <eos> the other makes me a phoenix in love 's fire <eos> so that i grieve when i enjoy your presence <eos> and die for grief by reason of your absence <eos>
great soul , thou sittest with me in my room <eos> uplifting me with thy vast , quiet eyes <eos> on whose full orbs , with kindly lustre , lies <eos> the twilight warmth of ruddy ember gloom <eos> thy clear , strong tones will oft bring sudden bloom <eos> of hope secure , to him who lonely cries <eos> wrestling with the young poet 's agonies <eos> neglect and scorn , which seem a certain doom <eos> yes ! the few words which , like great thunder drops <eos> thy large heart down to earth shook doubtfully <eos> thrilled by the inward lightning of its might <eos> serene and pure , like gushing joy of light <eos> shall track the eternal chords of destiny <eos> after the moon led pulse of ocean stops <eos>
while with false pride , and narrow jealousy <eos> numbers reject each new expression , won <eos> perchance , from language richer than our own <eos> o ! with glad welcome may the poet see <eos> extension 's golden vantage ! the decree <eos> each way exclusive , scorn , and re enthrone <eos> the obsolete , if strength , or grace of tone <eos> or imagery await it , with a free <eos> and liberal daring !— for the critic train <eos> whose eyes severe our verbal stores review <eos> let the firm bard require that they explain <eos> their cause of censure ; then in balance true <eos> weigh it ; but smile at the objections vain <eos> of sickly spirits , hating for they do <eos>
we mourn not for our martyrs !— for they perish <eos> as the good perish , for a deathless faith <eos> their glorious memories men will fondly cherish <eos> in terms and signs that shall ennoble death <eos> their blood becomes a principle , to guide <eos> onward , forever onward , in proud flow <eos> restless , resistless , as the ocean tide <eos> the spirit heaven yields freedom here below <eos> how should we mourn the martyrs , who arise <eos> even from the stake and scaffold , to the skies <eos> and take their thrones , as slars ; and o'er the night <eos> shed a new glory ; and to other souls <eos> shine out with blessed guidance , and true light <eos> which leads successive races to their goals <eos>
a little garden on a bleak hillside <eos> where deep the heavy , dazzling mountain snow <eos> lies far into the spring . the sun 's pale glow <eos> is scarcely able to melt patches wide <eos> about the single rose bush . all denied <eos> of nature 's tender ministries . but no <eos> for wonder working faith has made it blow <eos> with flowers many hued and starry eyed <eos> here sleeps the sun long , idle summer hours <eos> here butterflies and bees fare far to rove <eos> amid the crumpled leaves of poppy flowers <eos> here four o'clocks , to the passionate night above <eos> fling whiffs of perfume , like pale incense showers <eos> a little garden , loved with a great love <eos>
led by the dark dominicans of spain <eos> a newborn fury walks the wide domain <eos> gaunt inquisition ; mark her giant stride <eos> her blood nursed vulture screaming at her side <eos> her priestly train the tools of torment brings <eos> racks , wheels and crosses , faggots , stakes and strings <eos> scaffolds and cages round her altar stand <eos> and , tipt with sulphur , waves her flaming brand <eos> her imps of inquest round the fiend advance <eos> suspectors grave , and spies with eye askance <eos> pretended heretics who worm the soul <eos> and sly confessors with their secret scroll <eos> accusers hired , for each conviction paid <eos> judges retain 'd and witnesses by trade <eos>
love , you did give all i asked , i think <eos> more than i merit , yes , by many times <eos> and perfect eyes , and more than perfect mouth <eos> but had you — oh , with the same perfect brow <eos> and the low voice my soul hears , as a bird <eos> the fowler 's pipe , and follows to the snare <eos> had you , with these the same , but brought a mind <eos> some women do so . had the mouth there urged <eos> “ god and the glory ! never care for gain <eos> the present by the future , what is that <eos> live for fame , side by side with agnolo <eos> rafael is waiting : up to god , all three <eos> i might have done it for you . so it seems <eos> perhaps not . all is as god overrules <eos>
as men in summer fearles passe the foord <eos> which is in winter lord of all the plaine <eos> and with his tumbling streames doth beare aboord <eos> the ploughmans hope and shepheards labour vaine <eos> and as the coward beasts use to despise <eos> the noble lion after his lives end <eos> whetting their teeth , and with vaine foolhardise <eos> daring the foe that cannot him defend <eos> and as at troy most dastards of the greekes <eos> did brave about the corpes of hector colde <eos> so those which whilome wont with pallid cheekes <eos> the romane triumphs glorie to behold <eos> now on these ashie tombes shew boldnesse vaine <eos> and , conquer 'd , dare the conquerour disdaine <eos>
“ may'st thou achieve , ” she said , with earnest eyes <eos> bent on her babe , who reached its tender hands <eos> to buddh — knowing , belike , as children know <eos> more than we deem , and reverencing our lord <eos> but he arose — made strong with that pure meat <eos> and bent his footsteps where a great tree grew <eos> the bodhi tree ( thenceforward in all years <eos> never to fade , and ever to be kept <eos> in homage of the world ) , beneath whose leaves <eos> it was ordained that truth should come to buddh <eos> which now the master knew ; wherefore he went <eos> with measured pace , steadfast , majestical <eos> unto the tree of wisdom . oh , ye worlds <eos> rejoice ! our lord wended unto the tree <eos>
three sliding years , with slowly blended change <eos> drew round their winter , summer , autumn , spring <eos> fulfilled of work by hands , and brain , and heart <eos> he laboured as before ; though when he would <eos> and nature urged not , he , with privilege <eos> would spare from hours of toil — read in his room <eos> or wander through the moorland to the hills <eos> there on the apex of the world would stand <eos> as on an altar , burning , soul and heart <eos> himself the sacrifice of faith and prayer <eos> gaze in the face of the inviting blue <eos> that domed him round ; ask why it should be blue <eos> pray yet again ; and with love strengthened heart <eos> go down to lower things with lofty cares <eos>
“ great perils , father ! wait the unequal fight <eos> these younger champions will oppress thy might <eos> thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow <eos> weak is thy servant , and thy coursers slow <eos> then haste , ascend my seat , and from the car <eos> observe the steeds of tros , renown ’ d in war <eos> practised alike to turn , to stop , to chase <eos> to dare the fight , or urge the rapid race <eos> these late obey ’ d æ neas ’ guiding rein <eos> leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train <eos> with these against yon trojans will we go <eos> nor shall great hector want an equal foe <eos> fierce as he is , even he may learn to fear <eos> the thirsty fury of my flying spear <eos>
the worldly prince doth in his sceptre hold <eos> a kind of heaven in his authorities <eos> the wealthy miser , in his mass of gold <eos> makes to his soul a kind of paradise <eos> the epicure that eats and drinks all day <eos> accounts no heaven , but in his hellish routs <eos> and she , whose beauty seems a sunny day <eos> makes up her heaven but in her baby 's clouts <eos> but , my sweet god , i seek no prince 's power <eos> no miser 's wealth , nor beauty 's fading gloss <eos> which pamper sin , whose sweets are inward sour <eos> and sorry gains that breed the spirit 's loss <eos> no , my dear lord , let my heaven only be <eos> in my love 's service , but to live to thee <eos>
i have heard the pigeons of the seven woods <eos> make their faint thunder , and the garden bees <eos> hum in the lime tree flowers ; and put away <eos> the unavailing outcries and the old bitterness <eos> that empty the heart . i have forgot awhile <eos> tara uprooted , and new commonness <eos> upon the throne and crying about the streets <eos> and hanging its paper flowers from post to post <eos> because it is alone of all things happy <eos> i am contented for i know that quiet <eos> wanders laughing and eating her wild heart <eos> among pigeons and bees , while that great archer <eos> who but awaits his hour to shoot , still hangs <eos> a cloudy quiver over parc na lee <eos>
take any station , pavement , circus , corner <eos> where men their styles of print may call or choose <eos> and there — ten times more on it than jack horner <eos> there shall you find him swathed in sheets of news <eos> nothing can stay the placing of his wares <eos> not bus , nor cab , nor dray ! the very slop <eos> that imp of power , is powerless ! ever he dares <eos> and , daring , lands his public neck and crop <eos> even the many tortured london ear <eos> the much enduring , loathes his speeshul yell <eos> his shriek of winnur ! but his dart and leer <eos> and poise are irresistible . pall mall <eos> joys in him , and mile end ; for his vocation <eos> is to purvey the stuff of conversation <eos>
like as whilome the children of the earth <eos> heapt hils on hils to scale the starrie skie <eos> and fight against the gods of heavenly berth <eos> whiles iove at them his thunderbolts let flie <eos> all suddenly with lightning overthrowne <eos> the furious squadrons downe to ground did fall <eos> that th'earth under her childrens weight did grone <eos> and th'heavens in glorie triumpht over all <eos> so did that haughtie front , which heaped was <eos> on these seven romane hils , it selfe upreare <eos> over the world , and lift her loftie face <eos> against the heaven , that gan her force to feare <eos> but now these scorned fields bemone her fall <eos> and gods secure feare not her force at all <eos>
be it not mine to steal the cultured flower <eos> from any garden of the rich and great <eos> nor seek with care , through many a weary hour <eos> some novel form of wonder to create <eos> enough for me the leafy woods to rove <eos> and gather simple cups of morning dew <eos> or , in the fields and meadows that i love <eos> find beauty in their bells of every hue <eos> thus round my cottage floats a fragrant air <eos> and though the rustic plot be humbly laid <eos> yet , like the lilies gladly growing there <eos> i have not toiled , but take what god has made <eos> my lord ambition passed , and smiled in scorn <eos> i plucked a rose , and , lo ! it had no thorn <eos>
when winds that move not its calm surface sweep <eos> the azure sea , i love the land no more <eos> the smiles of the serene and tranquil deep <eos> tempt my unquiet mind .— but when the roar <eos> of ocean 's gray abyss resounds , and foam <eos> gathers upon the sea , and vast waves burst <eos> i turn from the drear aspect to the home <eos> of earth and its deep woods , where , interspersed <eos> when winds blow loud , pines make sweet melody <eos> whose house is some lone bark , whose toil the sea <eos> whose prey the wandering fish , an evil lot <eos> has chosen .— but i my languid limbs will fling <eos> beneath the plane , where the brook 's murmuring <eos> moves the calm spirit , but disturbs it not <eos>
dame fortune often loves a laugh to raise <eos> and , playing off her tricks and roguish ways <eos> instead of giving us what we desire <eos> mere quid pro quo permits us to acquire <eos> i 've found her gambols such from first to last <eos> and judge the future by experience past <eos> fair cloris and myself felt mutual flame <eos> and , when a year had run , the sprightly dame <eos> prepared to grant me , if i may be plain <eos> some slight concessions that would ease my pain <eos> this was her aim ; but whatsoe'er in view <eos> ‘ tis opportunity we should pursue <eos> the lover , who 's discreet , will moments seize <eos> and ev'ry effort then will tend to please <eos>
oh let us never leave that happy throng <eos> from that low attitude of love not cease <eos> in all the world there is no other peace <eos> in all the world no other shield from wrong <eos> but chiefly , saviour , for thy feet we long <eos> for no vain quiet , for no pride 's increase <eos> but that , being weak , and thou divinely strong <eos> us from our hateful selves thou mayst release <eos> we wander from thy fold 's free holy air <eos> forget thy looks , and take our fill of sin <eos> but if thou keep us evermore within <eos> we never surely can forget thee there <eos> breathing thy breath , thy white robe given to wear <eos> and loving thee for all thou diedst to win <eos>
i cannot think that thou shouldst pass away <eos> whose life to mine is an eternal law <eos> a piece of nature that can have no flaw <eos> a new and certain sunrise every day <eos> but , if thou art to be another ray <eos> about the sun of life , and art to live <eos> free from what part of thee was fugitive <eos> the debt of love i will more fully pay <eos> not downcast with the thought of thee so high <eos> but rather raised to be a nobler man <eos> and more divine in my humanity <eos> as knowing that the waiting eyes which scan <eos> my life are lighted by a purer being <eos> and ask high , calm browed deeds , with it agreeing <eos>
lyre of the sonnet , that full many a time <eos> amus 'd my lassitude , and sooth 'd my pains <eos> when graver cares forbade the lengthen 'd strains <eos> to thy brief bound , and oft returning chime <eos> a long farewell !— the splendid forms of rhyme <eos> when grief in lonely orphanism reigns <eos> oppress the drooping soul .— death 's dark domains <eos> throw mournful shadows o'er the aonian clime <eos> for in their silent bourne my filial bands <eos> lie all dissolv 'd ;— and swiftly wasting pour <eos> from my frail glass of life , health 's sparkling sands <eos> sleep then , my lyre , thy tuneful tasks are o'er <eos> sleep ! for my heart bereav 'd , and listless hands <eos> wake with rapt touch thy glowing strings no more <eos>
the air of the valley has felt the chill <eos> the workers pause at the door of the mill <eos> the housewife , keen to the shivering air <eos> arrests her foot on the cottage stair <eos> instinctive taught by the mother love <eos> and thinks of the sleeping ones above <eos> why start the listeners ? why does the course <eos> of the mill stream widen ? is it a horse <eos> hark to the sound of his hoofs , they say <eos> that gallops so wildly williamsburg way <eos> god ! what was that , like a human shriek <eos> from the winding valley ? will nobody speak <eos> will nobody answer those women who cry <eos> as the awful warnings thunder by <eos>
because i feel that , in the heavens above <eos> the angels , whispering to one another <eos> can find , among their burning terms of love <eos> none so devotional as that of “ mother <eos> therefore by that dear name i long have called you <eos> you who are more than mother unto me <eos> and fill my heart of hearts , where death installed you <eos> in setting my virginia 's spirit free <eos> my mother — my own mother , who died early <eos> was but the mother of myself ; but you <eos> are mother to the one i loved so dearly <eos> and thus are dearer than the mother i knew <eos> by that infinity with which my wife <eos> was dearer to my soul than its soul life <eos>
needs must i leave and yet needs must i love <eos> in vain my wit doth tell in verse my woe <eos> despair in me , disdain in thee , doth show <eos> how by my wit i do my folly prove <eos> all this my heart from love can never move <eos> love is not in my heart . no , lady , no <eos> my heart is love itself . till i forego <eos> my heart i never can my love remove <eos> how can i then leave love ? i do intend <eos> not to crave grace , but yet to wish it still <eos> not to praise thee , but beauty to commend <eos> and so , by beauty 's praise , praise thee i will <eos> for as my heart is love , love not in me <eos> so beauty thou , beauty is not in thee <eos>
the world was in its day of peril dark <eos> wont to believe the dotage of fond love <eos> from the fair cyprian deity , who rolls <eos> in her third epicycle , shed on men <eos> by stream of potent radiance : therefore they <eos> of elder time , in their old error blind <eos> not her alone with sacrifice ador 'd <eos> and invocation , but like honours paid <eos> to cupid and dione , deem 'd of them <eos> her mother , and her son , him whom they feign 'd <eos> to sit in dido 's bosom : and from her <eos> whom i have sung preluding , borrow 'd they <eos> the appellation of that star , which views <eos> now obvious and now averse , the sun <eos>
ah wherefore with infection should he live <eos> and with his presence grace impiety <eos> that sin by him advantage should achieve <eos> and lace it self with his society <eos> why should false painting imitate his cheek <eos> and steal dead seeming of his living hue <eos> why should poor beauty indirectly seek <eos> roses of shadow , since his rose is true <eos> why should he live , now nature bankrupt is <eos> beggared of blood to blush through lively veins <eos> for she hath no exchequer now but his <eos> and proud of many , lives upon his gains <eos> o him she stores , to show what wealth she had <eos> in days long since , before these last so bad <eos>
homes of our sires , where learning 's temple rose <eos> while vet they struggled with their banded foes <eos> as in the west thy century 's sun descends <eos> one parting gleam its dying radiance lends <eos> darker and deeper though the shadows fall <eos> from the gray towers on doubting castle 's wall <eos> though pope and pagan re array their hosts <eos> and her new armor youthful science boasts <eos> truth , for whose altar rose this holy shrine <eos> shall fly for refuge to these bowers of thine <eos> no past shall chain her with its rusted vow <eos> no jew 's phylactery bind her christian brow <eos> but faith shall smile to find her sister free <eos> and nobler manhood draw its life from thee <eos>
thus prayed the sage : the eternal gave consent <eos> and peals of thunder shook the firmament <eos> presumptuous troy mistook the accepting sign <eos> and catch ’ d new fury at the voice divine <eos> as , when black tempests mix the seas and skies <eos> the roaring deeps in watery mountains rise <eos> above the sides of some tall ship ascend <eos> its womb they deluge , and its ribs they rend <eos> thus loudly roaring , and o ’ erpowering all <eos> mount the thick trojans up the grecian wall <eos> legions on legions from each side arise <eos> thick sound the keels ; the storm of arrows flies <eos> fierce on the ships above , the cars below <eos> these wield the mace , and those the javelin throw <eos>
i would in rich and golden coloured rain <eos> with tempting showers in pleasant sort descend <eos> into fair phillis ’ lap , my lovely friend <eos> when sleep her sense with slumber doth restrain <eos> i would be chang è d to a milk white bull <eos> when midst the gladsome fields she should appear <eos> by pleasant fineness to surprise my dear <eos> whilst from their stalks , she pleasant flowers did pull <eos> i were content to weary out my pain <eos> to be narsissus so she were a spring <eos> to drown in her those woes my heart do wring <eos> and more ; i wish transform è d to remain <eos> that whilst i thus in pleasure 's lap did lie <eos> i might refresh desire , which else would die <eos>
then said bisesa to the priests at dusk <eos> when the white mist rose up breast high , and choked <eos> the voices in the houses of the dead <eos> “ yabosh and kysh avail not . if the horse <eos> reach the unlighted shrine we surely die <eos> ye have forgotten of all gods the chief <eos> taman ! ” here rolled the thunder through the hills <eos> and yabosh shook upon his pedestal <eos> “ ye have forgotten of all gods the chief <eos> too long . ” and all were dumb save one , who cried <eos> on yabosh with the sapphire ‘ twixt his knees <eos> but found no answer in the smoky roof <eos> and , being smitten of the sickness , died <eos> before the altar of the sapphire shrine <eos>
to gasperin 's so often went our wight <eos> the wife at length became his sole delight <eos> whose youth and beauty were by all confessed <eos> but , ‘ midst these charms , such av'rice she possessed <eos> the warmest love was checked — a thing not rare <eos> in modern times at least , among the fair <eos> ‘ tis true , as i 've already said , with such <eos> sighs naught avail , and promises not much <eos> without a purse , who wishes should express <eos> would vainly hope to gain a soft caress <eos> the god of love no other charm employs <eos> then cards , and dress , and pleasure 's cheering joys <eos> from whose gay shops more cuckolds we behold <eos> than heroes sallied from troy 's horse of old <eos>
vanity of vanities , the preacher saith <eos> all things are vanity . the eye and ear <eos> cannot be filled with what they see and hear <eos> like early dew , or like the sudden breath <eos> of wind , or like the grass that withereth <eos> is man , tossed to and fro by hope and fear <eos> so little joy hath he , so little cheer <eos> till all things end in the long dust of death <eos> to day is still the same as yesterday <eos> to morrow also even as one of them <eos> and there is nothing new under the sun <eos> until the ancient race of time be run <eos> the old thorns shall grow out of the old stem <eos> and morning shall be cold and twilight grey <eos>
there never yet was flower fair in vain <eos> let classic poets rhyme it as they will <eos> the seasons toil that it may blow again <eos> and summer 's heart doth feel its every ill <eos> nor is a true soul ever born for naught <eos> wherever any such hath lived and died <eos> there hath been something for true freedom wrought <eos> some bulwark levelled on the evil side <eos> toil on , then , greatness ! thou art in the right <eos> however narrow souls may call thee wrong <eos> be as thou wouldst be in thine own clear sight <eos> and so thou shalt be in the world 's erelong <eos> for worldlings cannot , struggle as they may <eos> from man 's great soul one great thought hide away <eos>
fair art thou , phillis , ay , so fair , sweet maid <eos> as nor the sun , nor i have seen more fair <eos> for in thy cheeks sweet roses are embayed <eos> and gold more pure than gold doth gild thy hair <eos> sweet bees have hived their honey on thy tongue <eos> and hebe spiced her nectar with thy breath <eos> about thy neck do all the graces throng <eos> and lay such baits as might entangle death <eos> in such a breast what heart would not be thrall <eos> from such sweet arms who would not wish embraces <eos> at thy fair hands who wonders not at all <eos> wonder itself through ignorance embases <eos> yet natheless though wondrous gifts you call these <eos> my faith is far more wonderful than all these <eos>
here from this summit where i often roam <eos> i can behold my cot , my humble home <eos> there i was born , and when this life is o'er <eos> i hope to sleep upon the river 's shore <eos> there is the orchard which i helped to rear <eos> it well repays my labor year by year <eos> one apple tree towers high above the rest <eos> where every spring a blackbird has its nest <eos> sweet lily used to stand beneath the bough <eos> and smiling listen — but she comes not now <eos> a fairer bird ne'er charmed the rising day <eos> than she we loved thus early called away <eos> but she is gone to sing her holy strains <eos> in lovelier gardens and on greener plains <eos>
for mahomet may dream of heavenly stews <eos> where virgin rose , soon as it 's lost , renews <eos> and shake with every breath of air serene <eos> as trembling for the rapes they 've daily seen <eos> when if those past can shake their height profound <eos> ridotto sure will fell them to the ground <eos> here art to nature join 'd makes it compleat <eos> and pyramids and trees together meet <eos> statues amidst the thickest grove arise <eos> and lofty columns tow'ring to the skies <eos> then next an obelisk its shade displays <eos> and rustic rockwork fills each empty space <eos> each joins to make it noble , and excells <eos> beaufets for food , grotto 's for something else <eos>
she said . with awe divine , the queen of love <eos> obey ’ d the sister and the wife of jove <eos> and from her fragrant breast the zone embraced <eos> with various skill and high embroidery graced <eos> in this was every art , and every charm <eos> to win the wisest , and the coldest warm <eos> fond love , the gentle vow , the gay desire <eos> the kind deceit , the still reviving fire <eos> persuasive speech , and the more persuasive sighs <eos> silence that spoke , and eloquence of eyes <eos> this on her hand the cyprian goddess laid <eos> “ take this , and with it all thy wish ; ” she said <eos> with smiles she took the charm ; and smiling press ’ d <eos> the powerful cestus to her snowy breast <eos>
what though his feet were shod with sharp , fierce flame <eos> and death and ruin were his daily squires <eos> the scythian , helped by heaven 's thunders , came <eos> the time was ripe for god 's avenging fires <eos> lo ! loose , lewd trulls , and lean , luxurious liars <eos> had brought the fair , fine face of rome to shame <eos> and made her one with sins beyond a name <eos> that queenly daughter of imperial sires <eos> the blood of elders like the blood of sheep <eos> was dashed across the circus . once while din <eos> and dust and lightnings , and a draggled heap <eos> of beast slain men made lords with laughter leap <eos> night fell , with rain . the earth , so sick of sin <eos> had turned her face into the dark to weep <eos>
the winds have grown articulate in thee <eos> and voiced again the wail of ancient woe <eos> that smote upon the winds of long ago <eos> the cries of trojan women as they flee <eos> the quivering moan of pale andromache <eos> now lifted loud with pain and now brought low <eos> it is the soul of sorrow that we know <eos> as in a shell the soul of all the sea <eos> so sometimes in the compass of a song <eos> unknown to him who sings , thro ’ lips that live <eos> the voiceless dead of long forgotten lands <eos> proclaim to us their heaviness and wrong <eos> in sweeping sadness of the winds that give <eos> thy strings no rest from weariless wild hands <eos>
then as a bride in all her glory decked <eos> approaches with a gladdened heart t ’ embrace <eos> th ’ expectant bridegroom on the nuptial bed <eos> e'en so ascended this fair queen the pyre <eos> and there embracing lay by her dear lord <eos> the fire was lighted and the pyre was closed <eos> and speedily to ashes were reduced <eos> the lifeless husband and the living wife <eos> the moslem came — heard of the death she died <eos> amid the flames , repented of his deed <eos> and , it is said , he built a lordly town <eos> in honour of the queen , who counted it <eos> a sin her noble husband to survive <eos> and in a moment flung her life away <eos>
birds sing and build , and nature scorns alone <eos> on may 's young festival to be a widow <eos> the children , too , have pleasures all their own <eos> in gathering lady smocks along the meadow <eos> the little brook sings loud among the pebbles <eos> so very loud , that water flowers , which lie <eos> where many a silver curdle boils and dribbles <eos> dance too with joy as it goes singing by <eos> among the pasture mole hills maidens stoop <eos> to pluck the luscious marjoram for their bosoms <eos> the greensward 's littered o'er with buttercups <eos> and whitethorns , they are breaking down with blossoms <eos> ‘ t is nature 's livery for the bonny may <eos> who keeps her court , and all have holiday <eos>
beloved , my beloved , when i think <eos> that thou wast in the world a year ago <eos> what time i sat alone here in the snow <eos> and saw no footprint , heard the silence sink <eos> no moment at thy voice , but , link by link <eos> went counting all my chains as if that so <eos> they never could fall off at any blow <eos> struck by thy possible hand ,— why , thus i drink <eos> of life 's great cup of wonder ! wonderful <eos> never to feel thee thrill the day or night <eos> with personal act or speech ,— nor ever cull <eos> some prescience of thee with the blossoms white <eos> thou sawest growing ! atheists are as dull <eos> who cannot guess god 's presence out of sight <eos>

“ from these dire shores our rapid course we held <eos> auspicious gales the flying canvas swell 'd <eos> and joy 's faint sunshine kindled in my eyes <eos> as the last mountain mingled with the skies <eos> when , by conflicting winds together driven <eos> a night of clouds involved the starless heaven <eos> fierce and more fierce th ’ increasing tempest blew <eos> the thunder rattled , and the lightning flew <eos> soon , borne at random o'er the watery way <eos> the yawning rocks our guideless ship betray <eos> my shrieking comrades sink .— some power unseen <eos> preserved me , trembling , thro ’ the deathful scene <eos> i rode th ’ opposing waves , and from the steep <eos> beheld the vessel plunge into the flashing deep <eos>
while i gazed at that fair one 's cheek , a shade <eos> of thought or care stole softly over <eos> like that by a cloud in a summer 's day made <eos> looking down on a field of blossoming clover <eos> the rose yet lay on her cheek , but its flush <eos> had something lost of its brilliant blush <eos> and the light in her eye , and the light on the wheels <eos> that marched so calmly round above her <eos> was a little dimmed ,— as when evening steals <eos> upon noon 's hot face . yet one could n't but love her <eos> for she looked like a mother whose first babe lay <eos> rocked on her breast , as she swung all day <eos> and she seemed , in the same silver tone , to say <eos> “ passing away ! passing away <eos>
yes , call me by my pet name ! let me hear <eos> the name i used to run at , when a child <eos> from innocent play , and leave the cowslips plied <eos> to glance up in some face that proved me dear <eos> with the look of its eyes . i miss the clear <eos> fond voices which , being drawn and reconciled <eos> into the music of heaven 's undefiled <eos> call me no longer . silence on the bier <eos> while i call god — call god !— so let thy mouth <eos> be heir to those who are now exanimate <eos> gather the north flowers to complete the south <eos> and catch the early love up in the late <eos> yes , call me by that name ,— and i , in truth <eos> with the same heart , will answer and not wait <eos>
calm is all nature as a resting wheel <eos> the kine are couch 'd upon the dewy grass <eos> the horse alone , seen dimly as i pass <eos> is up , and cropping yet his later meal <eos> dark is the ground ; a slumber seems to steal <eos> o'er vale , and mountain , and the starless sky <eos> now , in this blank of things , a harmony <eos> home felt , and home created seems to heal <eos> that grief for which the senses still supply <eos> fresh food ; for only then , when memory <eos> is hush 'd , am i at rest . my friends , restrain <eos> those busy cares that would allay my pain <eos> oh ! leave me to myself ; nor let me feel <eos> the officious touch that makes me droop again <eos>
who shall invoke her , who shall be her priest <eos> with single rites the common debt to pay <eos> on some green headland fronting to the east <eos> our fairest boy shall kneel at break of day <eos> naked , uplifting in a laden tray <eos> new milk and honey and sweet tinctured wine <eos> not without twigs of clustering apple spray <eos> to wreath a garland for our lady 's shrine <eos> the morning planet poised above the sea <eos> shall drop sweet influence through her drowsing lid <eos> dew drenched , his delicate virginity <eos> shall scarce disturb the flowers he kneels amid <eos> that , waked so lightly , shall lift up their eyes <eos> cushion his knees , and nod between his thighs <eos>
in sunday school engaged twice each lord 's day <eos> and hearing three discourses , some would say <eos> no time could then remain for aught beside <eos> but this , my friends , has only to be tried <eos> for cooper , in reserve , two hours still kept <eos> an elder 's invitation to accept <eos> him to accompany to his home , and there <eos> join in sweet conversation , hymn or prayer <eos> thus mostly passed his sabbaths for two years <eos> which kept him free from many doubts and fears <eos> enabled him to work at business still <eos> with easy mind , and with right hearty will <eos> and find that wisdom 's ways are pleasantness <eos> while all her paths are peace and heart felt bliss <eos>
sweet , i protest , and seal it with an oath <eos> i never saw that so my thoughts did please <eos> and yet content displeased i see them wroth <eos> to love so much and cannot have their ease <eos> i told my thoughts , my sovereign made a pause <eos> disposed to grant , but willing to delay <eos> they then repined , for that they knew no cause <eos> and swore they wished she flatly would say nay <eos> thus hath my love , my thoughts with treason filled <eos> and ‘ gainst my sovereign taught them to repine <eos> so thus my treason all my thoughts hath killed <eos> and made fair licia say she is not mine <eos> but thoughts too rash my heart doth now repent <eos> and as you please , they swear , they are content <eos>
scarce had the voices ceased , when forth there came <eos> another candidate for village fame <eos> by gratitude to heaven , by honest pride <eos> impell 'd to rise and cast his doubts aside <eos> a sturdy yeoman , button 'd to the throat <eos> faced the whole ring , and shook his leathern coat <eos> “ i have a tale of private life to tell <eos> “ ‘ tis all of self and home , i know it well <eos> “ in love and honour 's cause i would be strong <eos> “ mine is a father 's tale , perhaps too long <eos> “ for fathers , when a duteous child 's the theme <eos> “ can talk a summer 's sun down , and then dream <eos> “ of retrospective joys with hearts that glow <eos> “ with feelings such as parents only know <eos>
the poetry of earth is never dead <eos> when all the birds are faint with the hot sun <eos> and hide in cooling trees , a voice will run <eos> from hedge to hedge about the new mown mead <eos> that is the grasshopper 's — he takes the lead <eos> in summer luxury ,— he has never done <eos> with his delights ; for when tired out with fun <eos> he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed <eos> the poetry of earth is ceasing never <eos> on a lone winter evening , when the frost <eos> has wrought a silence , from the stove there shrills <eos> the cricket 's song , in warmth increasing ever <eos> and seems to one in drowsiness half lost <eos> the grasshopper 's among some grassy hills <eos>
much have i travelled in the realms of gold <eos> and many goodly states and kingdoms seen <eos> round many western islands have i been <eos> which bards in fealty to apollo hold <eos> oft of one wide expanse had i been told <eos> that deep browed homer ruled as his demesne <eos> yet never did i breathe its pure serene <eos> till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold <eos> then felt i like some watcher of the skies <eos> when a new planet swims into his ken <eos> or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes <eos> he stared at the pacific — and all his men <eos> looked at each other with a wild surmise <eos> silent , upon a peak in darien <eos>
if there be any one can take my place <eos> and make you happy whom i grieve to grieve <eos> think not that i can grudge it , but believe <eos> i do commend you to that nobler grace <eos> that readier wit than mine , that sweeter face <eos> yea , since your riches make me rich , conceive <eos> i too am crowned , while bridal crowns i weave <eos> and thread the bridal dance with jocund pace <eos> for if i did not love you , it might be <eos> that i should grudge you some one dear delight <eos> but since the heart is yours that was mine own <eos> your pleasure is my pleasure , right my right <eos> your honorable freedom makes me free <eos> and you companioned i am not alone <eos>
if light of life outlive the set of sun <eos> that men call death and end of all things , then <eos> how should not that which life held best for men <eos> and proved most precious , though it seem undone <eos> by force of death and woful victory won <eos> be first and surest of revival , when <eos> death shall bow down to life arisen again <eos> so shall the soul seen be the self same one <eos> that looked and spake with even such lips and eyes <eos> as love shall doubt not then to recognise <eos> and all bright thoughts and smiles of all time past <eos> revive , transfigured , but in spirit and sense <eos> none other than we knew , for evidence <eos> that love 's last mortal word was not his last <eos>
the silent room , the heavy creeping shade <eos> the dead that travel fast , the opening door <eos> the murdered brother rising through the floor <eos> the ghost 's white fingers on thy shoulders laid <eos> and then the lonely duel in the glade <eos> the broken swords , the stifled scream , the gore <eos> thy grand revengeful eyes when all is o'er <eos> these things are well enough ,— but thou wert made <eos> for more august creation ! frenzied lear <eos> should at thy bidding wander on the heath <eos> with the shrill fool to mock him , romeo <eos> for thee should lure his love , and desperate fear <eos> pluck richard 's recreant dagger from its sheath <eos> thou trumpet set for shakespeare 's lips to blow <eos>
“ inglorious sons of an unhappy sire <eos> why did not all in hector ’ s cause expire <eos> wretch that i am ! my bravest offspring slain <eos> you , the disgrace of priam ’ s house , remain <eos> mestor the brave , renown ’ d in ranks of war <eos> with troilus , dreadful on his rushing car <eos> and last great hector , more than man divine <eos> for sure he seem ’ d not of terrestrial line <eos> all those relentless mars untimely slew <eos> and left me these , a soft and servile crew <eos> whose days the feast and wanton dance employ <eos> gluttons and flatterers , the contempt of troy <eos> why teach ye not my rapid wheels to run <eos> and speed my journey to redeem my son <eos>
an only son he had — a noble prince <eos> the terror of his foes , the poor man 's friend <eos> he mastered all the arts of peace and war <eos> and was a worthy father 's worthy son <eos> what gifts and graces men as beauties deem <eos> these nature freely lavished on the youth <eos> and people loved in wonder to behold <eos> the face that kindled pleasure in their minds <eos> the courage of a warrior in the field <eos> a woman 's tender pity to the weak <eos> all these were centred in the royal youth <eos> his arrows killed full many a beast that wrought <eos> dread havoc on the cattle of the poor <eos> such was the famous prince of panchala <eos>
retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting <eos> delaying and straying and playing and spraying <eos> advancing and prancing and glancing and dancing <eos> recoiling , turmoiling and toiling and boiling <eos> and gleaming and streaming and steaming and beaming <eos> and rushing and flushing and brushing and gushing <eos> and flapping and rapping and clapping and slapping <eos> and curling and whirling and purling and twirling <eos> and thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping <eos> and dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing <eos> and so never ending , but always descending <eos> sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending <eos> all at once and all o'er , with a mighty uproar <eos> and this way the water comes down at lodore <eos>
if e'er again return those awful days <eos> whose clouds were crimsoned with the beacon 's blaze <eos> whose grass was trampled by the soldier 's heel <eos> whose tides were reddened round the rushing keel <eos> god grant some lyre may wake a nobler strain <eos> to rend the silence of our tented plain <eos> when gallia 's flag its triple fold displays <eos> her marshalled legions peal the marseillaise <eos> when round the german close the war clouds dim <eos> far through their shadows floats his battle hymn <eos> when , crowned with joy , the camps ’ of england ring <eos> a thousand voices shout , “ god save the king <eos> when victory follows with our eagle 's glance <eos> our nation 's anthem pipes a country dance <eos>
already the rutulians deem their man <eos> o'ermatch ' d in arms , before the fight began <eos> first rising fears are whisper 'd thro ’ the crowd <eos> then , gath'ring sound , they murmur more aloud <eos> now , side to side , they measure with their eyes <eos> the champions ’ bulk , their sinews , and their size <eos> the nearer they approach , the more is known <eos> th ’ apparent disadvantage of their own <eos> turnus himself appears in public sight <eos> conscious of fate , desponding of the fight <eos> slowly he moves , and at his altar stands <eos> with eyes dejected , and with trembling hands <eos> and , while he mutters undistinguish 'd pray'rs <eos> a livid deadness in his cheeks appears <eos>
