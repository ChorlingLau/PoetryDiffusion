o truant muse what shall be thy amends <eos> for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed <eos> both truth and beauty on my love depends <eos> so dost thou too , and therein dignified <eos> make answer muse , wilt thou not haply say <eos> ‘ truth needs no colour with his colour fixed <eos> beauty no pencil , beauty 's truth to lay <eos> but best is best , if never intermixed <eos> because he needs no praise , wilt thou be dumb <eos> excuse not silence so , for't lies in thee <eos> to make him much outlive a gilded tomb <eos> and to be praised of ages yet to be <eos> then do thy office muse , i teach thee how <eos> to make him seem long hence , as he shows now <eos>
then still abiding in that ensign rang 'd <eos> wherewith the romans over awed the world <eos> those burning splendours of the holy spirit <eos> took up the strain ; and thus it spake again <eos> “ none ever hath ascended to this realm <eos> who hath not a believer been in christ <eos> either before or after the blest limbs <eos> were nail 'd upon the wood . but lo ! of those <eos> who call ‘ christ , christ , ’ there shall be many found <eos> in judgment , further off from him by far <eos> than such , to whom his name was never known <eos> christians like these the ethiop shall condemn <eos> when that the two assemblages shall part <eos> one rich eternally , the other poor <eos>
oh ! death will find me , long before i tire <eos> of watching you ; and swing me suddenly <eos> into the shade and loneliness and mire <eos> of the last land ! there , waiting patiently <eos> one day , i think , i 'll feel a cool wind blowing <eos> see a slow light across the stygian tide <eos> and hear the dead about me stir , unknowing <eos> and tremble . and i shall know that you have died <eos> and watch you , a broad browed and smiling dream <eos> pass , light as ever , through the lightless host <eos> quietly ponder , start , and sway , and gleam <eos> most individual and bewildering ghost <eos> and turn , and toss your brown delightful head <eos> amusedly , among the ancient dead <eos>
is there a man on earth , who , every night <eos> when the day hath exhausted each strong limb <eos> lays him upon his bed in chamber dim <eos> and his heart straightway trembling with delight <eos> begins to burn up towards the vaulted height <eos> of the great peace that overshadows him <eos> like flakes of fire his thoughts within him swim <eos> till all his soul is radiant , blazing bright <eos> the great earth under him an altar is <eos> upon whose top a sacrifice he lies <eos> burning to god up through the nightly skies <eos> whose love , warm brooding o'er him , kindled his <eos> until his flaming thoughts , consumed , expire <eos> sleep 's ashes covering the yet glowing fire <eos>
a heavy heart , beloved , have i borne <eos> from year to year until i saw thy face <eos> and sorrow after sorrow took the place <eos> of all those natural joys as lightly worn <eos> as the stringed pearls , each lifted in its turn <eos> by a beating heart at dance time . hopes apace <eos> were changed to long despairs , till god 's own grace <eos> could scarcely lift above the world forlorn <eos> my heavy heart . then thou didst bid me bring <eos> and let it drop adown thy calmly great <eos> deep being ! fast it sinketh , as a thing <eos> which its own nature does precipitate <eos> while thine doth close above it , mediating <eos> betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate <eos>
a little upright , pert , tart , tripping wight <eos> and still his precious self his dear delight <eos> who loves his own smart shadow in the streets <eos> better than e'er the fairest she he meets <eos> much specious lore , but little understood <eos> ( veneering oft outshines the solid wood <eos> his solid sense , by inches you must tell <eos> but mete his cunning by the scottish ell <eos> a man of fashion too , he made his tour <eos> learn 'd “ vive la bagatelle et vive l'amour <eos> so travell 'd monkeys their grimace improve <eos> polish their grin — nay , sigh for ladies ’ love <eos> his meddling vanity , a busy fiend <eos> still making work his selfish craft must mend <eos>
this said , to sage piraeus sped the seer <eos> his honour 'd host , a welcome inmate there <eos> o'er the protracted feast the suitors sit <eos> and aim to wound the prince with pointless wit <eos> cries one , with scornful leer and mimic voice <eos> “ thy charity we praise , but not thy choice <eos> why such profusion of indulgence shown <eos> to this poor , timorous , toil detesting drone <eos> that others feeds on planetary schemes <eos> and pays his host with hideous noon day dreams <eos> but , prince ! for once at least believe a friend <eos> to some sicilian mart these courtiers send <eos> where , if they yield their freight across the main <eos> dear sell the slaves ! demand no greater gain <eos>
mine eye with all the deadly sins is fraught <eos> first proud , sith it presumed to look so high <eos> a watchman being made , stood gazing by <eos> and idle , took no heed till i was caught <eos> and envious , bears envy that by thought <eos> should in his absence be to her so nigh <eos> to kill my heart , mine eye let in her eye <eos> and so consent gave to a murder wrought <eos> and covetous , it never would remove <eos> from her fair hair , gold so doth please his sight <eos> unchaste , a baud between my heart and love <eos> a glutton eye , with tears drunk every night <eos> these sins procur è d have a goddess ’ ire <eos> wherefore my heart is damned in love 's sweet fire <eos>
and little dagonet mincing with his feet <eos> ‘ knight , an ye fling those rubies round my neck <eos> in lieu of hers , i 'll hold thou hast some touch <eos> of music , since i care not for thy pearls <eos> swine ? i have wallowed , i have washed — the world <eos> is flesh and shadow — i have had my day <eos> the dirty nurse , experience , in her kind <eos> hath fouled me — an i wallowed , then i washed <eos> i have had my day and my philosophies <eos> and thank the lord i am king arthur 's fool <eos> swine , say ye ? swine , goats , asses , rams and geese <eos> trooped round a paynim harper once , who thrummed <eos> on such a wire as musically as thou <eos> some such fine song — but never a king 's fool <eos>
she loves me ! from her own bliss breathing lips <eos> the live confession came , like rich perfume <eos> from crimson petals bursting into bloom <eos> and still my heart at the remembrance skips <eos> like a young lion , and my tongue , too , trips <eos> as drunk with joy ! while every object seen <eos> in life 's diurnal round wears in its mien <eos> a clear assurance that no doubts eclipse <eos> and if the common things of nature now <eos> are like old faces flushed with new delight <eos> much more the consciousness of that rich vow <eos> deepens the beauteous , and refines the bright <eos> while throned i seem on love 's divinest height <eos> ‘ mid all the glories glowing round its brow <eos>
but not the less for lack of wind went she <eos> the flying pinnace , o'er that silent sea <eos> till those dull waters of enchantment lay <eos> behind her many a league . and now her way <eos> was toward a shining tract of ocean , where <eos> low winds with bland breath flattered the mild air <eos> and low waves did together clasp and close <eos> and skyward yearning from the sea there rose <eos> and seaward yearning from the sky there fell <eos> a spirit of deep content unspeakable <eos> so midway meeting betwixt sky and sea <eos> these twain are married for eternity <eos> and rule the spirits of that deep , and share <eos> the lordship of the legions of the air <eos>
friends of the stage ! to whom both players and plays <eos> must sue alike for pardon or for praise <eos> whose judging voice and eye alone direct <eos> the boundless power to cherish or reject <eos> if e'er frivolity has led to fame <eos> and made us blush that you forbore to blame <eos> if e'er the sinking stage could condescend <eos> to soothe the sickly taste it dare not mend <eos> all past reproach may present scenes refute <eos> and censure , wisely loud , be justly mute <eos> oh ! since your fiat stamps the drama 's laws <eos> forbear to mock us with misplaced applause <eos> so pride shall doubly nerve the actor 's powers <eos> and reason 's voice be echoed back by ours <eos>
retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting <eos> delaying and straying and playing and spraying <eos> advancing and prancing and glancing and dancing <eos> recoiling , turmoiling and toiling and boiling <eos> and gleaming and streaming and steaming and beaming <eos> and rushing and flushing and brushing and gushing <eos> and flapping and rapping and clapping and slapping <eos> and curling and whirling and purling and twirling <eos> and thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping <eos> and dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing <eos> and so never ending , but always descending <eos> sounds and motions forever and ever are blending <eos> all at once and all o'er , with a mighty uproar <eos> and this way the water comes down at lodore <eos>
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes <eos> and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he <eos> remembered in what a haughtier guise <eos> he had flung an alms to leprosie <eos> “ when he caged his young life up in gilded mail <eos> and set forth in search of the holy grail <eos> the heart within him was ashes and dust <eos> he parted in twain his single crust <eos> he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink <eos> and gave the leper to eat and drink <eos> ‘ t was a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread <eos> ‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl <eos> yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed <eos> and ‘ t was red wine he drank with his thirsty soul <eos>
though thou art now a ruin bare and cold <eos> thou wert sometime the garden of a king <eos> the birds have sought a lovelier place to sing <eos> the flowers are few . it was not so of old <eos> it was not thus when hand in hand there strolled <eos> through arbors perfumed with undying spring <eos> bare bodies beautiful , brown , glistening <eos> decked with green plumes and rings of yellow gold <eos> do you suppose the herdsman sometimes hears <eos> vague echoes borne beneath the moon 's pale ray <eos> from those old , old , far off , forgotten years <eos> who knows ? here where his ancient kings held sway <eos> he stands . their names are strangers to his ears <eos> even their memory has passed away <eos>
go , then , and join the murmuring city 's throng <eos> me thou dost leave to solitude and tears <eos> to busy phantasies , and boding fears <eos> lest ill betide thee ; but ‘ twill not be long <eos> ere the hard season shall be past ; till then <eos> live happy ; sometimes the forsaken shade <eos> remembering , and these trees now left to fade <eos> nor , ‘ mid the busy scenes and hum of men <eos> wilt thou my cares forget : in heaviness <eos> to me the hours shall roll , weary and slow <eos> till mournful autumn past , and all the snow <eos> of winter pale , the glad hour i shall bless <eos> that shall restore thee from the crowd again <eos> to the green hamlet on the peaceful plain <eos>
the battle quickly raged ; alike they erred <eos> the pirates slaughter loved , and blood preferred <eos> and , long accustomed to the stormy tide <eos> were most expert , and on their skill relied <eos> in numbers , too , superior they were found <eos> but hisipal 's valour greatly shone around <eos> and kept the combat undecided long <eos> at length grifonio , wond'rous large and strong <eos> with twenty sturdy , pirates got on board <eos> and many soon lay gasping by the sword <eos> where'er he trod , grim death and horrour reigned <eos> at length , the round the noble hispal gained <eos> his nervous arm laid many wretches low <eos> rage marked his eyes , whene'er he dealt a blow <eos>
how empty seems the town now you are gone <eos> a wilderness of sad streets , where gaunt walls <eos> hide nothing to desire ; sunshine falls <eos> eery , distorted , as it long had shone <eos> on white , dead faces tombed in halls of stone <eos> the whir of motors , stricken through with calls <eos> of playing boys , floats up at intervals <eos> but all these noises blur to one long moan <eos> what quest is worth pursuing ? and how strange <eos> that other men still go accustomed ways <eos> i hate their interest in the things they do <eos> a spectre horde repeating without change <eos> an old routine . alone i know the days <eos> are still born , and the world stopped , lacking you <eos>
the castle gate stands open now <eos> and the wanderer is welcome to the hall <eos> as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough <eos> no longer scowl the turrets tall <eos> the summer 's long siege at last is o'er <eos> when the first poor outcast went in at the door <eos> she entered with him in disguise <eos> and mastered the fortress by surprise <eos> there is no spot she loves so well on ground <eos> she lingers and smiles there the whole year round <eos> the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land <eos> has hall and bower at his command <eos> and there 's no poor man in the north countree <eos> but is lord of the earldom as much as he <eos>
much sorrow in itself my love doth move <eos> more my despair to love a hopeless bliss <eos> my folly most to love whom sure to miss <eos> o help me , but this last grief to remove <eos> all pains , if you command , it joy shall prove <eos> and wisdom to seek joy . then say but this <eos> “ because my pleasure in thy torment is <eos> i do command thee without hope to love <eos> so when this thought my sorrow shall augment <eos> that my own folly did procure my pain <eos> then shall i say to give myself content <eos> “ obedience only made me love in vain <eos> it was your will , and not my want of wit <eos> i have the pain , bear you the blame of it <eos>
i sit within my room and joy to find <eos> that thou who always lov'st art with me here <eos> that i am never left by thee behind <eos> but by thyself thou keep'st me ever near <eos> the fire burns brighter when with thee i look <eos> and seems a kindlier servant sent to me <eos> with gladder heart i read thy holy book <eos> because thou art the eyes with which i see <eos> this aged chair , that table , watch , and door <eos> around in ready service ever wait <eos> nor can i ask of thee a menial more <eos> to fill the measure of my large estate <eos> for thou thyself , with all a father 's care <eos> where'er i turn art ever with me there <eos>

these words were thunder to belphegor 's ears <eos> who instantly took flight , so great his fears <eos> to hell 's abyss he fled without delay <eos> to tell adventures through the realms of day <eos> sire , said the demon , it is clearly true <eos> damnation does the marriage knot pursue <eos> your highness often hither sees arrive <eos> not squads , but regiments , who , when alive <eos> by hymen were indissolubly tied <eos> in person i the fact have fully tried <eos> th ’ institution , perhaps , most just could be <eos> past ages far more happiness might see <eos> but ev'ry thing , with time , corruption shows <eos> no jewel in your crown more lustre throws <eos>

thou hast made me , and shall thy work decay <eos> repair me now , for now mine end doth haste <eos> i run to death , and death meets me as fast <eos> and all my pleasures are like yesterday <eos> i dare not move my dim eyes any way <eos> despair behind , and death before , doth cast <eos> such terror , and my feeble flesh doth waste <eos> by sin in it , which it towards hell doth weigh <eos> only thou art above , and when towards thee <eos> by thy leave i can look , i rise again <eos> but our old subtle foe so tempteth me <eos> that not one hour myself i can sustain <eos> thy grace may wing me to prevent his art <eos> and thou , like adamant , draw mine iron heart <eos>

the stars had fled before the growing morn <eos> when eager voices ( as the fates drew on <eos> the world to ruin ) round pompeius ’ tent <eos> demand the battle signal . what ! by those <eos> so soon to perish , shall the sign be asked <eos> their own , their country 's doom ? ah ! fatal rage <eos> that hastens on the hour ; no other sun <eos> upon this living host shall rise again <eos> “ pompeius fears ! ” they cry . “ he 's slow to act <eos> too ‘ kind to caesar ; and he fondly rules <eos> a world of subject peoples ; but with peace <eos> such rule were ended . ” eastern kings no less <eos> and peoples , eager for their distant homes <eos> already murmured at the lengthy war <eos>
but thou , my country , though no fault be thine <eos> for that red horror far across the sea <eos> though not a tortured wretch can point to thee <eos> and curse thee for the selfishness supine <eos> of those great powers that cowardly combine <eos> to shield the turk in his iniquity <eos> yet , since thy hand is innocent and free <eos> arise , and show the world the way divine <eos> thou canst not break the oppressor 's iron rod <eos> but thou canst help and comfort the oppressed <eos> thou canst not loose the captive 's heavy chain <eos> but thou canst bind his wounds and soothe his pain <eos> armenia calls thee , sovereign of the west <eos> to play the good samaritan for god <eos>
watchword sublime of rome 's imperial sage <eos> tersest of synonyms for self control <eos> paramount precept of the stoic 's age <eos> noblest of mottoes for the lofty soul <eos> would thou wert writ in characters of light <eos> at every turn to greet my reverent gaze <eos> and bid me face life 's evils , calm , upright <eos> unspoiled alike by calumny or praise <eos> with all our science we are slaves of fate <eos> what is to come we know not , cannot know <eos> grief , suffering , death ,— all touch us soon or late <eos> the master question , how to meet the blow <eos> grant me , ye gods , through life a steadfast eye <eos> and then , with equanimity , to die <eos>
ah ! might i range each hallow 'd bower and glade <eos> mus æ us cultur 'd , many a raptur 'd sigh <eos> wou 'd that dear , local consciousness supply <eos> beneath his willow , in the grotto 's shade <eos> whose roof his hand with ores and shells inlaid <eos> how sweet to watch , with reverential eye <eos> thro ’ the sparr 'd arch , the streams he oft survey 'd <eos> thine , blue tham é sis , gently wandering by <eos> this is the poet 's triumph , and it towers <eos> o'er life 's pale ills , his consciousness of powers <eos> that lift his memory from oblivion 's gloom <eos> secure a train of these heart thrilling hours <eos> by his idea deck 'd in rapture 's bloom <eos> for spirits rightly touch 'd , thro ’ ages yet to come <eos>
yet , yet forgive me , oh ye sacred few <eos> whom late by delaware 's green banks i knew <eos> whom , known and loved through many a social eve <eos> ‘ twas bliss to live with , and ‘ twas pain to leave <eos> not with more joy the lonely exile scanned <eos> the writing traced upon the desert 's sand <eos> where his lone heart but little hoped to find <eos> one trace of life , one stamp of human kind <eos> than did i hail the pure , the enlightened zeal <eos> the strength to reason and the warmth to feel <eos> the manly polish and the illumined taste <eos> which ,— mid the melancholy , heartless waste <eos> my foot has traversed ,— oh you sacred few <eos> i found by delaware 's green banks with you <eos>
i view that oak , the fancied glades among <eos> by which as milton lay , his evening ear <eos> from many a cloud that dropped ethereal dew <eos> nigh sphered in heaven , its native strains could hear <eos> on which that ancient trump he reached was hung <eos> thither oft , his glory greeting <eos> from waller 's myrtle shades retreating <eos> with many a vow from hope 's aspiring tongue <eos> my trembling feet his guiding steps pursue <eos> in vain — such bliss to one alone <eos> of all the sons of soul was known <eos> and heaven and fancy , kindred powers <eos> have now o'erturned th ’ inspiring bowers <eos> or curtained close such scene from every future view <eos>
“ god bless the darling eva ! ” was my prayer <eos> a pure , unconscious depth of earnestness <eos> was in her eyes , so indescribable <eos> you might as well the color of the air <eos> seek to daguerreotype , or to impress <eos> a stain upon the river , whose first swell <eos> would swirl it to the deep . a calm , sweet soul <eos> where love 's celestial saints and ministers <eos> did hold the earthly under such control <eos> virtue sprung up like daisies from the sod <eos> oh , for one hour 's sweet excellence like hers <eos> one hour of sinlessness , that never more <eos> can visit me this side the silent shore <eos> to stand , like her , serene , unblushing before god <eos>
if beauty thus be clouded with a frown <eos> that pity shines no comfort to my bliss <eos> and vapours of disdain so overgrown <eos> that my life 's light wholly indarkened is <eos> why should i more molest the world with cries <eos> the air with sighs , the earth below with tears <eos> since i live hateful to those ruthful eyes <eos> vexing with untuned moan her dainty ears <eos> if i have loved her dearer than my breath <eos> my breath that calls the heaven to witness it <eos> and still hold her most dear until my death <eos> and if that all this cannot move one whit <eos> yet sure she cannot but must think apart <eos> she doth me wrong to grieve so true a heart <eos>
by such smooth words was eva won to break <eos> her promise , and went on with her new friend <eos> over the glistening snow and down a bank <eos> where a white shelf , wrought by the eddying wind <eos> like to a billow 's crest in the great sea <eos> curtained an opening . “ look , we enter here <eos> and straight , beneath the fair o'erhanging fold <eos> entered the little pair that hill of snow <eos> walking along a passage with white walls <eos> and a white vault above where snow stars shed <eos> a wintry twilight . eva moved in awe <eos> and held her peace , but the snow maiden smiled <eos> and talked and tripped along , as , down the way <eos> deeper they went into that mountainous drift <eos>
by holy motives led , and not chagrin <eos> the hermit never spoke of what he 'd seen <eos> but , from the youth 's discernment , strove to hide <eos> whate'er regarded love , and much beside <eos> the softer sex , with all their magick charms <eos> that fill the feeling bosom with alarms <eos> as years advanced , the boy with care he taught <eos> what suited best his age before him brought <eos> at five he showed him animals and flow'rs <eos> the birds of air , the beasts , their sev'ral pow'rs <eos> and now and then of hell he gave a hint <eos> old satan 's wrath , and what might awe imprint <eos> how formed , and doomed to infamy below <eos> in childhood fear ‘ s the lesson first we know <eos>
sudden his forehead he lifted high <eos> a faint sound strayed like a moth wing by <eos> like beacons his eyes burst blazing forth <eos> a dust cloud he spied in the distant north <eos> a noise and a smoke on the plain afar <eos> ‘ tis the cloud and the clang of the moslem war <eos> he leapt aloft like a tiger snared <eos> the wine in his veins through his visage flared <eos> he tore at his fetters in bootless ire <eos> he called the prophet , he named his sire <eos> from his lips , with wild shout , the techir burst <eos> he danced in his irons ; the giaours he cursed <eos> and his eyes they flamed like a beacon dun <eos> or like wine in the crystal twixt eye and sun <eos>
at which the boy with sudden childish rage <eos> “ my mother dead ! and sent a grace by thee <eos> thou liest , woman ! take thy false words back <eos> and still impetuous and unreasoning <eos> fighting the facts of life in rebel mood <eos> ( a child of sudden temper , guileless heart <eos> he seized her , struggling with a furious might <eos> to make her unsay what her lips had told <eos> perhaps he might have harmed her in his wrath <eos> had not the ag è d gurnemanz come near <eos> and drawn him back , with the sharp spoken words <eos> “ impetuous child , restrain thy violence <eos> this woman harms thee not . she speaks the truth <eos> kundry has seen it , for she never lies <eos>

fair is my love , and cruel as she 's fair <eos> her brow shades frowns although her eyes are sunny <eos> her smiles are lightning though her pride despair <eos> and her disdains are gall , her favours honey <eos> a modest maid , decked with a blush of honour <eos> whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love <eos> the wonder of all eyes that look upon her <eos> sacred on earth , designed a saint above <eos> chastity and beauty , which were deadly foes <eos> live reconcil è d friends within her brow <eos> and had she pity to conjoin with those <eos> then who had heard the plaints i utter now <eos> o had she not been fair and thus unkind <eos> my muse had slept and none had known my mind <eos>
land of our fathers , in thine hour of need <eos> god help thee , guarded by the passive creed <eos> as the lone pilgrim trusts to beads and cowl <eos> when through the forest rings the gray wolf 's howl <eos> as the deep galleon trusts her gilded prow <eos> when the black corsair slants athwart her bow <eos> as the poor pheasant , with his peaceful mien <eos> trusts to his feathers , shining golden green <eos> when the dark plumage with the crimson beak <eos> has rustled shadowy from its splintered peak <eos> so trust thy friends , whose babbling tongues would charm <eos> the lifted sabre from thy foeman 's arm <eos> thy torches ready for the answering peal <eos> from bellowing fort and thunder freighted keel <eos>
tumultuous rushing o'er the outstretched plains <eos> a wildered maze of comets and of suns <eos> the blood of changeless god that ever runs <eos> with quick diastole up the immortal veins <eos> a phantom host that moves and works in chains <eos> a monstrous fiction , which , collapsing , stuns <eos> the mind to stupor and amaze at once <eos> a tragedy which that man best explains <eos> who rushes blindly on his wild career <eos> with trampling hoofs and sound of mailed war <eos> who will not nurse a life to win a tear <eos> but is extinguished like a falling star <eos> such will at times this life appear to me <eos> until i learn to read more perfectly <eos>
run , shepherds , run where bethlehem blest appears <eos> we bring the best of news ; be not dismayed <eos> a saviour there is born more old than years <eos> amidst heaven 's rolling height this earth who stayed <eos> in a poor cottage inned , a virgin maid <eos> a weakling did him bear , who all upbears <eos> there is he poorly swaddled , in manger laid <eos> to whom too narrow swaddlings are our spheres <eos> run , shepherds , run , and solemnize his birth <eos> this is that night — no , day , grown great with bliss <eos> in which the power of satan broken is <eos> in heaven be glory , peace unto the earth <eos> thus singing , through the air the angels swam <eos> and cope of stars re echo é d the same <eos>
i wish sometimes , although a worthless thing <eos> spurred by ambition , glad to aspire <eos> myself a monarch , or some mighty king <eos> and then my thoughts do wish for to be higher <eos> but when i view what winds the cedars toss <eos> what storms men feels that covet for renown <eos> i blame myself that i have wished my loss <eos> and scorn a kingdom , though it give a crown <eos> ah licia , though the wonder of my thought <eos> my heart 's content , procurer of my bliss <eos> for whom a crown i do esteem as naught <eos> as asia 's wealth , too mean to buy a kiss <eos> kiss me , sweet love , this favor do for me <eos> then crowns and kingdoms shall i scorn for thee <eos>
if this were true , england indeed were dead <eos> if the wild fashion of that poisonous hour <eos> wherein the new salome , clothed with power <eos> wriggled and hissed , with hands and feet so red <eos> should even now demand that glorious head <eos> whose every word was like an english flower <eos> whose every song an english april shower <eos> whose every thought immortal wine and bread <eos> if this were true , if england should prefer <eos> darkness , corruption , and the adulterous crew <eos> shakespeare and browning would cry shame on her <eos> and milton would deny the land he knew <eos> and those who died in flanders yesterday <eos> would thank their god they sleep in cleaner clay <eos>
he that goes back does , since he goes , advance <eos> though he doth not advance who goeth back <eos> and he that seeks , though he on nothing chance <eos> may still by words be said to find a lack <eos> this paradox of having , that is nought <eos> in the world ’ s meaning of the things it screens <eos> is yet true of the substance of pure thought <eos> and there means something by the nought it means <eos> for thinking nought does on nought being confer <eos> as giving not is acting not to give <eos> and , to the same unbribed true thought , to err <eos> is to find truth , though by its negative <eos> so why call this world false , if false to be <eos> be to be aught , and being aught being to be <eos>
oh , yes ! they love through all this world of ours <eos> i will not gainsay love , called love forsooth <eos> i have heard love talked in my early youth <eos> and since , not so long back but that the flowers <eos> then gathered , smell still . mussulmans and giaours <eos> throw kerchiefs at a smile , and have no ruth <eos> for any weeping . polypheme 's white tooth <eos> slips on the nut if , after frequent showers <eos> the shell is over smooth ,— and not so much <eos> will turn the thing called love , aside to hate <eos> or else to oblivion . but thou art not such <eos> a lover , my beloved ! thou canst wait <eos> through sorrow and sickness , to bring souls to touch <eos> and think it soon when others cry “ too late <eos>
when i have seen by time 's fell hand defaced <eos> the rich proud cost of outworn buried age <eos> when sometime lofty towers i see down rased <eos> and brass eternal slave to mortal rage <eos> when i have seen the hungry ocean gain <eos> advantage on the kingdom of the shore <eos> and the firm soil win of the watery main <eos> increasing store with loss , and loss with store <eos> when i have seen such interchange of state <eos> or state it self confounded , to decay <eos> ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate <eos> that time will come and take my love away <eos> this thought is as a death which cannot choose <eos> but weep to have , that which it fears to lose <eos>
she gave up beauty in her tender youth <eos> gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways <eos> she covered up her eyes lest they should gaze <eos> on vanity , and chose the bitter truth <eos> harsh towards herself , towards others full of ruth <eos> servant of servants , little known to praise <eos> long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days <eos> she schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth <eos> that with the poor and stricken she might make <eos> a home , until the least of all sufficed <eos> her wants ; her own self learned she to forsake <eos> counting all earthly gain but hurt and loss <eos> so with calm will she chose and bore the cross <eos> and hated all for love of jesus christ <eos>
i had withdrawn in forest , and my song <eos> was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway <eos> and to the forest edge you came one day <eos> ( this was my dream ) and looked and pondered long <eos> but did not enter , though the wish was strong <eos> you shook your pensive head as who should say <eos> ‘ i dare not — too far in his footsteps stray <eos> he must seek me would he undo the wrong <eos> not far , but near , i stood and saw it all <eos> behind low boughs the trees let down outside <eos> and the sweet pang it cost me not to call <eos> and tell you that i saw does still abide <eos> but ‘ tis not true that thus i dwelt aloof <eos> for the wood wakes , and you are here for proof <eos>
whither fled lamia , now a lady bright <eos> a full born beauty new and exquisite <eos> she fled into that valley they pass o'er <eos> who go to corinth from cenchreas ’ shore <eos> and rested at the foot of those wild hills <eos> the rugged founts of the peraean rills <eos> and of that other ridge whose barren back <eos> stretches , with all its mist and cloudy rack <eos> south westward to cleone . there she stood <eos> about a young bird 's flutter from a wood <eos> fair , on a sloping green of mossy tread <eos> by a clear pool , wherein she passioned <eos> to see herself escap 'd from so sore ills <eos> while her robes flaunted with the daffodils <eos>
thou comest ! all is said without a word <eos> i sit beneath thy looks , as children do <eos> in the noon sun , with souls that tremble through <eos> their happy eyelids from an unaverred <eos> yet prodigal inward joy . behold , i erred <eos> in that last doubt ! and yet i cannot rue <eos> the sin most , but the occasion — that we two <eos> should for a moment stand unministered <eos> by a mutual presence . ah , keep near and close <eos> thou dove like help ! and when my fears would rise <eos> with thy broad heart serenely interpose <eos> brood down with thy divine sufficiencies <eos> these thoughts which tremble when bereft of those <eos> like callow birds left desert to the skies <eos>
‘ tis better to be vile than vile esteemed <eos> when not to be , receives reproach of being <eos> and the just pleasure lost , which is so deemed <eos> not by our feeling , but by others ’ seeing <eos> for why should others ’ false adulterate eyes <eos> give salutation to my sportive blood <eos> or on my frailties why are frailer spies <eos> which in their wills count bad what i think good <eos> no , i am that i am , and they that level <eos> at my abuses , reckon up their own <eos> i may be straight though they themselves be bevel <eos> by their rank thoughts , my deeds must not be shown <eos> unless this general evil they maintain <eos> all men are bad and in their badness reign <eos>
pride of the sister realm so long our own <eos> we claim with her that spotless fame of thine <eos> white as her snow and fragrant as her pine <eos> ours was thy birthplace , but in every zone <eos> some wreath of song thy liberal hand has thrown <eos> breathes perfume from its blossoms , that entwine <eos> where'er the dewdrops fall , the sunbeams shine <eos> on life 's long path with tangled cares o'ergrown <eos> can art thy truthful counterfeit command <eos> the silver haloed features , tranquil , mild <eos> soften the lips of bronze as when they smiled <eos> give warmth and pressure to the marble hand <eos> seek the lost rainbow in the sky it spanned <eos> farewell , sweet singer ! heaven reclaims its child <eos>
immortal singer , in whose glorious brain <eos> unearthly melodies were born to make <eos> a nocturn for the blessed master 's sake <eos> i see thee pass through heaven 's gates again <eos> i hear thee singing that majestic strain <eos> which soothed the heart affliction could not break <eos> and proved the faith no worldly ills could shake <eos> and then i see thee join god 's holy train <eos> but , wonder of all wonders ! where the light <eos> breaks from a thousand suns , the seraphs , shod <eos> with flaming sandals , lead thee ; and my sight <eos> dims with the vision , till fresh from his rod <eos> i see thee lift those orbs , once quenched in night <eos> and gaze into the steadfast eyes of god <eos>
a cup of wine , under the flowering trees <eos> i drink alone , for no friend is near <eos> raising my cup i beckon the bright moon <eos> for he , with my shadow , will make three men <eos> the moon , alas , is no drinker of wine <eos> listless , my shadow creeps about at my side <eos> yet with the moon as friend and the shadow as slave <eos> i must make merry before the spring is spent <eos> to the songs i sing the moon flickers her beams <eos> in the dance i weave my shadow tangles and breaks <eos> while we were sober , three shared the fun <eos> now we are drunk , each goes his way <eos> may we long share our odd , inanimate feast <eos> and meet at last on the cloudy river of the sky <eos>

when i had chosen on the river 's edge <eos> such station , that the distance of the stream <eos> alone did separate me ; there i stay 'd <eos> my steps for clearer prospect , and beheld <eos> the flames go onward , leaving , as they went <eos> the air behind them painted as with trail <eos> of liveliest pencils ! so distinct were mark 'd <eos> all those sev'n listed colours , whence the sun <eos> maketh his bow , and cynthia her zone <eos> these streaming gonfalons did flow beyond <eos> my vision ; and ten paces , as i guess <eos> parted the outermost . beneath a sky <eos> so beautiful , came foul and twenty elders <eos> by two and two , with flower de luces crown 'd <eos>
the stainless soul that smiled through glorious eyes <eos> the bright grave brow whereon dark fortune 's blast <eos> might blow , but might not bend it , nor o'ercast <eos> save for one fierce fleet hour of shame , the skies <eos> thrilled with warm dreams of worthier days to rise <eos> and end the whole world 's winter ; here at last <eos> if death be death , have passed into the past <eos> if death be life , live , though their semblance dies <eos> hope and high faith inviolate of distrust <eos> shone strong as life inviolate of the grave <eos> through each bright word and lineament serene <eos> most loving righteousness and love most just <eos> crowned , as day crowns the dawn enkindled wave <eos> with visible aureole thine unfaltering mien <eos>
the lady has agreed , you will remark <eos> that in a room where ev'ry part is dark <eos> ( perhaps to ‘ scape the keeper 's prying sight <eos> or shame directs exclusion of the light <eos> she will receive your gay inconstant spouse <eos> now , take her place ; the case deceit allows <eos> make jack your friend ; nor haggle at the price <eos> a hundred ducats give , is my advice <eos> he 'll place you in the room where darkness reigns <eos> think not too fast , nor suffer heavy chains <eos> do what you wish , and utter not a word <eos> to speak , assuredly would be absurd <eos> ‘ twould spoil the whole ; destroy the project quite <eos> attend , and see if all things be not right <eos>
i know myself . not servile for applause <eos> my muse permits no deprecating clause <eos> modest or vain , she will not be denied <eos> one bold confession due to honest pride <eos> and well she knows the drooping veil of song <eos> shall save her boldness from the caviller 's wrong <eos> her sweeter voice the heavenly maid imparts <eos> to tell the secrets of our aching hearts <eos> for this , a suppliant , captive , prostrate , bound <eos> she kneels imploring at the feet of sound <eos> for this , convulsed in thought 's maternal pains <eos> she loads her arms with rhyme 's resounding chains <eos> faint though the music of her fetters be <eos> it lends one charm ,— her lips are ever free <eos>
robert of sicily , brother of pope urbane <eos> and valmond , emperor of allemaine <eos> despoiled of his magnificent attire <eos> bareheaded , breathless , and besprent with mire <eos> with sense of wrong and outrage desperate <eos> strode on and thundered at the palace gate <eos> rushed through the courtyard , thrusting in his rage <eos> to right and left each seneschal and page <eos> and hurried up the broad and sounding stair <eos> his white face ghastly in the torches ’ glare <eos> from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed <eos> voices and cries he heard , but did not heed <eos> until at last he reached the banquet room <eos> blazing with light and breathing with perfume <eos>
henry ! i greet thine entrance into life <eos> sure presage that the myrmidons of fate <eos> the fool 's unmeaning laugh , the critic 's hate <eos> will dire assail thee ; and the envious strife <eos> of bookish schoolmen , beings over rife <eos> whose pia mater studious is fill 'd <eos> with unconnected matter , half distill 'd <eos> from letter 'd page , shall bare for thee the knife <eos> beneath whose edge the poet ofttimes sinks <eos> but fear not ! for thy modest work contains <eos> the germ of worth ; thy wild poetic strains <eos> how sweet to him , untutor 'd bard , who thinks <eos> thy verse “ has power to please , as soft it flows <eos> through the smooth murmurs of the frequent close <eos>
these empty accents mingled with the wind <eos> nor moved great jove ’ s unalterable mind <eos> to godlike hector and his matchless might <eos> was owed the glory of the destined fight <eos> like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried <eos> and all the gates sustain ’ d an equal tide <eos> through the long walls the stony showers were heard <eos> the blaze of flames , the flash of arms appear ’ d <eos> the spirit of a god my breast inspire <eos> to raise each act to life , and sing with fire <eos> while greece unconquer ’ d kept alive the war <eos> secure of death , confiding in despair <eos> and all her guardian gods , in deep dismay <eos> with unassisting arms deplored the day <eos>
whence came it that i knew in others ’ case <eos> how bitter sweet and tyrant slave is love <eos> how quick to jealous doubt it yieldeth place <eos> if mine own self did ne'er his power prove <eos> whence knew i the deep sense that in the soul <eos> is thrill 'd and thrall 'd by perfect beauty 's sight <eos> if never beauty did myself control <eos> with all the mastery of sovran might <eos> since so my heart laid bare what it contain 'd <eos> of understanding of love 's mysteries <eos> and nought of thine or mine our loving stain 'd <eos> that i should hide it from misprising eyes <eos> no shame or scruple might my judgement see <eos> to tell of that true love i bore to thee <eos>
there is a spell by which the panting soul <eos> shakes from its stainless pinions all the gyves <eos> wherewith our frail mortality still strives <eos> to bind it downward ‘ neath its stern controul <eos> when springing from the earth like the sweet lark <eos> that wings its flight in music to the sky <eos> amid the spheres it wanders , where the eye <eos> trembles to blindness , and the last faint spark <eos> of earth 's far gleaming flickers and expires <eos> thine is the charm , dear poesy , which sets <eos> the cag ë d spirit on its heavenward flight <eos> and fills its being with those pure desires <eos> and holy aspirations , which like light <eos> shower on the world in distillations bright <eos>
heralds at arms do three perfections quote <eos> to wit , most fair , most rich , most glittering <eos> so when those three concur within one thing <eos> needs must that thing of honour be a note <eos> lately i did behold a rich fair coat <eos> which wish è d fortune to mine eyes did bring <eos> a lordly coat , yet worthy of a king <eos> in which one might all these perfections note <eos> a field of lilies , roses proper bare <eos> two stars in chief ; the crest was waves of gold <eos> how glittering ‘ twas , might by the stars appear <eos> the lilies made it fair for to behold <eos> and rich it was as by the gold appeareth <eos> but happy he that in his arms it weareth <eos>
but while this softer art their bliss supplies <eos> it gives their follies also room to rise <eos> for praise , too dearly loved or warmly sought <eos> enfeebles all internal strength of thought <eos> and the weak soul , within itself unblessed <eos> leans for all pleasure on another 's breast <eos> hence ostentation here , with tawdry art <eos> pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart <eos> here vanity assumes her pert grimace <eos> and trims her robes of frieze with copper lace <eos> here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer <eos> to boast one splendid banquet once a year <eos> the mind still turns where shifting fashion draws <eos> nor weighs the solid worth of self applause <eos>
greece , conquered greece , her conqueror subdued <eos> and rome grew polished , who till then was rude <eos> the rough saturnian measure had its day <eos> and gentler arts made savagery give way <eos> yet traces of the uncouth past lived on <eos> for many a year , nor are they wholly gone <eos> for ‘ twas not till the punic wars were o'er <eos> that rome found time greek authors to explore <eos> and try , by digging in that virgin field <eos> what sophocles and aeschylus could yield <eos> nay , she essayed a venture of her own <eos> and liked to think she 'd caught the tragic tone <eos> and so she has :— the afflatus comes on hot <eos> but out , alas ! she deems it shame to blot <eos>
fair sun , if you would have me praise your light <eos> when night approacheth wherefore do you fly <eos> time is so short , beauties so many be <eos> as i have need to see them day and night <eos> that by continual view my verses might <eos> tell all the beams of your divinity <eos> which praise to you and joy should be to me <eos> you living by my verse , i by your sight <eos> i by your sight , and not you by my verse <eos> need mortal skill immortal praise rehearse <eos> no , no , though eyes were blind , and verse were dumb <eos> your beauty should be seen and your fame known <eos> for by the wind which from my sighs do come <eos> your praises round about the world are blown <eos>
weigh but the cause , and give me leave to plain me <eos> for all my hurt , that my heart 's queen hath wrought it <eos> she whom i love so dear , the more to pain me <eos> withholds my right where i have dearly bought it <eos> dearly i bought that was so slightly rated <eos> even with the price of blood and body 's wasting <eos> she would not yield that ought might be abated <eos> for all she saw my love was pure and lasting <eos> and yet now scorns performance of the passion <eos> and with her presence justice overruleth <eos> she tells me flat her beauty bears no action <eos> and so my plea and process she excludeth <eos> what wrong she doth , the world may well perceive it <eos> to accept my faith at first , and then to leave it <eos>
what guyle is this , that those her golden tresses <eos> she doth attyre under a net of gold <eos> and with sly skill so cunningly them dresses <eos> that which is gold or haire may scarse be told <eos> is it that mens frayle eyes , which gaze too bold <eos> she may entangle in that golden snare <eos> and , being caught , may craftily enfold <eos> their weaker harts , which are not wel aware <eos> take heed therefore , myne eyes , how ye doe stare <eos> henceforth too rashly on that guilefull net <eos> in which if ever ye entrapped are <eos> out of her bands ye by no meanes shall get <eos> fondnesse it were for any , being free <eos> to covet fetters , though they golden bee <eos>
then asmiel touched his hand and broke the thread <eos> of fine spun thought , and very gently said <eos> “ the one of whom thou thinkest bids thee go <eos> alone to spiran 's huts , across the snow <eos> to serve him there . ” with sorrow and surprise <eos> malvin looked up , reluctance in his eyes <eos> the broken thought , the strangeness of the call <eos> the perilous passage of the mountain wall <eos> the solitary journey , and the length <eos> of ways unknown , too great for his frail strength <eos> appalled him . with a doubtful brow <eos> he scanned the doubtful task , and muttered , “ how <eos> but asmiel answered , as he turned to go <eos> with cold disheartened voice , “ i do not know <eos>
we live by faith ; but faith is not the slave <eos> of text and legend . reason 's voice and god 's <eos> nature 's and duty 's , never are at odds <eos> what asks our father of his children , save <eos> justice and mercy and humility <eos> a reasonable service of good deeds <eos> pure living , tenderness to human needs <eos> reverence and trust , and prayer for light to see <eos> the master 's footprints in our daily ways <eos> no knotted scourge nor sacrificial knife <eos> but the calm beauty of an ordered life <eos> whose very breathing is unworded praise <eos> a life that stands as all true lives have stood <eos> firm rooted in the faith that god is good <eos>
then spake king arthur to sir bedivere <eos> “ far other is this battle in the west <eos> whereto we move , than when we strove in youth <eos> and brake the petty kings , and fought with rome <eos> or thrust the heathen from the roman wall <eos> and shook him thro ’ the north . ill doom is mine <eos> to war against my people and my knights <eos> the king who fights his people fights himself <eos> and they my knights , who loved me once , the stroke <eos> that strikes them dead is as my death to me <eos> yet let us hence , and find or feel a way <eos> thro ’ this blind haze , which ever since i saw <eos> one lying in the dust at almesbury <eos> hath folded in the passes of the world <eos>
“ say thou , whose praises all our host proclaim <eos> thou living glory of the grecian name <eos> say whence these coursers ? by what chance bestow ’ d <eos> the spoil of foes , or present of a god <eos> not those fair steeds , so radiant and so gay <eos> that draw the burning chariot of the day <eos> old as i am , to age i scorn to yield <eos> and daily mingle in the martial field <eos> but sure till now no coursers struck my sight <eos> like these , conspicuous through the ranks of fight <eos> some god , i deem , conferred the glorious prize <eos> bless ’ d as ye are , and favourites of the skies <eos> the care of him who bids the thunder roar <eos> and her , whose fury bathes the world with gore <eos>
he 's called the general from the brazen craft <eos> and dash with which he sneaks a bit of road <eos> and all its fares ; challenged , or chafed , or chaffed <eos> back answers of the newest he 'll explode <eos> he reins his horses with an air ; he treats <eos> with scoffing calm whatever powers there be <eos> he gets it straight , puts a bit on , and meets <eos> his losses with both lip and pounds s. d <eos> he arrogates a special taste in short <eos> is loftily grateful for a flagrant smoke <eos> at all the smarter housemaids winks his court <eos> and taps them for half crowns ; being stoney broke <eos> lives lustily ; is ever on the make <eos> and hath , i fear , none other gods but fake <eos>
frost views his brilliant foe with scornful eye <eos> and whirls a tenfold tempest thro the sky <eos> where each fine atom of the immense of air <eos> steel 'd , pointed , barb 'd for unexampled war <eos> sings o'er the shuddering ground ; when thus he broke <eos> contemptuous silence , and to hesper spoke <eos> thou comest in time to share their last disgrace <eos> to change to crystal with thy rebel race <eos> stretch thy huge corse o'er delaware 's bank afar <eos> and learn the force of elemental war <eos> or if undying life thy lamp inspire <eos> take that one blast and to thy sky retire <eos> there , roll 'd eternal round the heavens , proclaim <eos> thy own disaster and my deathless fame <eos>
“ love me , for i love you ” — and answer me <eos> “ love me , for i love you ” — so shall we stand <eos> as happy equals in the flowering land <eos> of love , that knows not a dividing sea <eos> love builds the house on rock and not on sand <eos> love laughs what while the winds rave desperately <eos> and who hath found love 's citadel unmanned <eos> and who hath held in bonds love 's liberty <eos> my heart 's a coward though my words are brave <eos> we meet so seldom , yet we surely part <eos> so often ; there 's a problem for your art <eos> still i find comfort in his book , who saith <eos> though jealousy be cruel as the grave <eos> and death be strong , yet love is strong as death <eos>
master so early of the various lyre <eos> energic , pure , sublime !— thus art thou gone <eos> in its bright dawn of fame that spirit flown <eos> which breathed such sweetness , tenderness , and fire <eos> wert thou but shown to win us to admire <eos> and veil in death thy splendour ?— but unknown <eos> their destination who least time have shone <eos> and brightest beamed .— when these the eternal sire <eos> — righteous , and wise , and good are all his ways <eos> eclipses as their sun begins to rise <eos> can mortal judge , for their diminish 'd days <eos> what blest equivalent in changeless skies <eos> what sacred glory waits them ?— his the praise <eos> gracious , whate'er he gives , whate'er denies <eos>
they knelt in silent anguish by her bed <eos> and could not weep ; but calmly there she lay <eos> all pain had left her ; and the sun 's last ray <eos> shone through upon her , warming into red <eos> the shady curtains . in her heart she said <eos> ‘ heaven opens ; i leave these and go away <eos> the bridegroom calls ,— shall the bride seek to stay <eos> then low upon her breast she bowed her head <eos> o lily flower , o gem of priceless worth <eos> o dove with patient voice and patient eyes <eos> o fruitful vine amid a land of dearth <eos> o maid replete with loving purities <eos> thou bowedst down thy head with friends on earth <eos> to raise it with the saints in paradise <eos>
full happy is the man who comes at last <eos> into the safe completion of his year <eos> weathered the perils of his spring , that blast <eos> how many blossoms promising and dear <eos> and of his summer , with dread passions fraught <eos> that oft , like fire through the ripening corn <eos> blight all with mocking death and leave distraught <eos> loved ones to mourn the ruined waste forlorn <eos> but now , though autumn gave but harvest slight <eos> oh , grateful is he to the powers above <eos> for winter 's sunshine , and the lengthened night <eos> by hearth side genial with the warmth of love <eos> through silvered days of vistas gold and green <eos> contentedly he glides away , serene <eos>
though night hath climbed her peak of highest noon <eos> and bitter blasts the screaming autumn whirl <eos> all night through archways of the bridg è d pearl <eos> and portals of pure silver walks the moon <eos> wake on , my soul , nor crouch to agony <eos> turn cloud to light , and bitterness to joy <eos> and dross to gold with glorious alchemy <eos> basing thy throne above the world 's annoy <eos> reign thou above the storms of sorrow and ruth <eos> that roar beneath ; unshaken peace hath won thee <eos> so shall thou pierce the woven glooms of truth <eos> so shall the blessing of the meek be on thee <eos> so in thine hour of dawn , the body 's youth <eos> an honourable eld shall come upon thee <eos>

beyond the sphere which spreads to widest space <eos> now soars the sigh that my heart sends above <eos> a new perception born of grieving love <eos> guideth it upward the untrodden ways <eos> when it hath reached unto the end and stays <eos> it sees a lady round whom splendors move <eos> in homage ; till , by the great light thereof <eos> abashed , the pilgrim spirit stands at gaze <eos> it sees her such , that when it tells me this <eos> which it hath seen , i understand it not <eos> it hath a speech so subtile and so fine <eos> and yet i know its voice within my thought <eos> often remembereth me of beatrice <eos> so that i understand it , ladies mine <eos>
yet the sweet simple , by misordered use <eos> death or some dangerous sickness may produce <eos> should we not for our sustentation eat <eos> because a surfeit comes from too much meat <eos> so our fair plant — that doth as needful stand <eos> as heaven , or fire , or air , or sea , or land <eos> as moon , or stars that rule the gloomy night <eos> or sacred friendship , or the sunny light <eos> her treasured virtue in herself enrolls <eos> and leaves the evil to vainglorious souls <eos> and yet , who dies with this celestial breath <eos> shall live immortal in a joyful death <eos> all goods , all pleasures it in one can link <eos> ‘ tis physic , clothing , music , meat , and drink <eos>
sebald . aye , thus it used to be <eos> ever your house was , i remember , shut <eos> till midday ; i observed that , as i strolled <eos> on mornings through the vale here ; country girls <eos> were noisy , washing garments in the brook <eos> hinds drove the slow white oxen up the hills <eos> but no , your house was mute , would ope no eye <eos> and wisely ; you were plotting one thing there <eos> nature , another outside . i looked up <eos> rough white wood shutters , rusty iron bars <eos> silent as death , blind in a flood of light <eos> oh , i remember !— and the peasants laughed <eos> and said , “ the old man sleeps with the young wife <eos> this house was his , this chair , this window — his <eos>
last i woke sane , but well nigh close to death <eos> for weakness : it was evening : silent light <eos> slept on the painted walls , wherein were wrought <eos> two grand designs ; for on one side arose <eos> the women up in wild revolt , and stormed <eos> at the oppian law . titanic shapes , they crammed <eos> the forum , and half crushed among the rest <eos> a dwarf like cato cowered . on the other side <eos> hortensia spoke against the tax ; behind <eos> a train of dames : by axe and eagle sat <eos> with all their foreheads drawn in roman scowls <eos> and half the wolf'shyppphenmilk curdled in their veins <eos> the fierce triumvirs ; and before them paused <eos> hortensia pleading : angry was her face <eos>
woe for the ‘ witching look of that fair face <eos> the port where ease with dignity combined <eos> woe for those accents ’ that each savage mind <eos> to softness tuned , to noblest thoughts the base <eos> and the sweet smile , from whence the dart i trace <eos> which now leaves death my only hope behind <eos> exalted soul , most fit on thrones to ‘ ve shined <eos> but that too late she came this earth to grace <eos> for you i still must burn , and breathe in you <eos> for i was ever yours ; of you bereft <eos> full little now i reck all other care <eos> with hope and with desire you thrill 'd me through <eos> when last my only joy on earth i left <eos> but caught by winds each word was lost in air <eos>
venus , with young adonis sitting by her <eos> under a myrtle shade , began to woo him <eos> she told the youngling how god mars did try her <eos> and as he fell to her , so fell she to him <eos> even thus , quoth she , the warlike god embrac 'd me <eos> and then she clipp 'd adonis in her arms <eos> even thus , quoth she , the warlike god unlaced me <eos> as if the boy should use like loving charms <eos> even thus , quoth she , he seized on my lips <eos> and with her lips on his did act the seizure <eos> and as she fetched breath , away he skips <eos> and would not take her meaning nor her pleasure <eos> ah ! that i had my lady at this bay <eos> to kiss and clip me till i run away <eos>
endearing waltz ! to thy more melting tune <eos> bow irish jig and ancient rigadoon <eos> scotch reels , avaunt ! and country dance forego <eos> your future claims to each fantastic toe <eos> waltz , waltz alone , both legs and arms demands <eos> liberal of feet , and lavish of her hands <eos> hands which may freely range in public sight <eos> where ne'er before — but — pray “ put out the light <eos> methinks the glare of yonder chandelier <eos> shines much too far , or i am much too near <eos> and true , though strange , waltz whispers this remark <eos> “ my slippery steps are safest in the dark <eos> but here the muse with due decorum halts <eos> and lends her longest petticoat to waltz <eos>
midst sunny grass clad meads that slope adown <eos> to lake boebeis stands an ancient town <eos> where dwelt of old a lord of thessaly <eos> the son of pheres and fair clymene <eos> who had to name admetus : long ago <eos> the dwellers by the lake have ceased to know <eos> his name , because the world grows old , but then <eos> he was accounted great among great men <eos> young , strong , and godlike , lacking nought at all <eos> of gifts that unto royal men might fall <eos> in those old simple days , before men went <eos> to gather unseen harm and discontent <eos> along with all the alien merchandise <eos> that rich folk need , too restless to be wise <eos>
oh ! when reflecting on these truths sublime <eos> how insignificant do all the joys <eos> the gaudes , and honours of the world appear <eos> how vain ambition ! why has my wakeful lamp <eos> outwatch 'd the slow paced night !— why on the page <eos> the schoolman 's labour 'd page , have i employ 'd <eos> the hours devoted by the world to rest <eos> and needful to recruit exhausted nature <eos> say , can the voice of narrow fame repay <eos> the loss of health ? or can the hope of glory <eos> lend a new throb into my languid heart <eos> cool , even now , my feverish aching brow <eos> relume the fires of this deep sunken eye <eos> or paint new colours on this pallid cheek <eos>

when i am standing on a mountain crest <eos> or hold the tiller in the dashing spray <eos> my love of you leaps foaming in my breast <eos> shouts with the winds and sweeps to their foray <eos> my heart bounds with the horses of the sea <eos> and plunges in the wild ride of the night <eos> flaunts in the teeth of tempest the large glee <eos> that rides out fate and welcomes gods to fight <eos> ho , love , i laugh aloud for love of you <eos> glad that our love is fellow to rough weather <eos> no fretful orchid hothoused from the dew <eos> but hale and hardy as the highland heather <eos> rejoicing in the wind that stings and thrills <eos> comrade of ocean , playmate of the hills <eos>
by floods , that , thundering from their dizzy height <eos> swell more gigantic on the stedfast sight <eos> black drizzling crags , that beaten by the din <eos> vibrate , as if a voice complained within <eos> bare steeps , where desolation stalks afraid <eos> unstedfast , by a blasted yew unstayed <eos> by cells whose image , trembling as he prays <eos> awe struck , the kneeling peasant scarce surveys <eos> loose hanging rocks the day 's bless 'd eye that hide <eos> and crosses reared to death on every side <eos> which with cold kiss devotion planted near <eos> and bending water 'd with the human tear <eos> that faded “ silent ” from her upward eye <eos> unmoved with each rude form of danger nigh <eos>
“ go first the master of thy herds to find <eos> true to his charge , a loyal swain and kind <eos> for thee he sighs ; and to the loyal heir <eos> and chaste penelope extends his care <eos> at the coracian rock he now resides <eos> where arethusa 's sable water glides <eos> the sable water and the copious mast <eos> swell the fat herd ; luxuriant , large repast <eos> with him rest peaceful in the rural cell <eos> and all you ask his faithful tongue shall tell <eos> me into other realms my cares convey <eos> to sparta , still with female beauty gay <eos> for know , to sparta thy loved offspring came <eos> to learn thy fortunes from the voice of fame <eos>
then still abiding in that ensign rang 'd <eos> wherewith the romans over awed the world <eos> those burning splendours of the holy spirit <eos> took up the strain ; and thus it spake again <eos> “ none ever hath ascended to this realm <eos> who hath not a believer been in christ <eos> either before or after the blest limbs <eos> were nail 'd upon the wood . but lo ! of those <eos> who call ‘ christ , christ , ’ there shall be many found <eos> in judgment , further off from him by far <eos> than such , to whom his name was never known <eos> christians like these the ethiop shall condemn <eos> when that the two assemblages shall part <eos> one rich eternally , the other poor <eos>
i know that all beneath the moon decays <eos> and what by mortals in this world is brought <eos> in time 's great periods shall return to nought <eos> that fairest states have fatal nights and days <eos> i know that all the muse 's heavenly lays <eos> with toil of sp'rit , which are so dearly bought <eos> as idle sounds , of few , or none , are sought <eos> that there is nothing lighter than vain praise <eos> i know frail beauty like the purple flower <eos> to which one morn oft birth and death affords <eos> that love a jarring is of minds ’ accords <eos> where sense and will envassal reason 's power <eos> know what i list , all this can not me move <eos> but that , alas ! i both must write and love <eos>
they reach the presence ; there he hears surpriz 'd <eos> the mortal charge of felony devis 'd <eos> stern did the monarch look , and sharp upbraid <eos> for foul seducement of his queen assay 'd <eos> the knight , whose loyal heart disdain 'd the offence <eos> with generous warmth affirm 'd his innocence <eos> he ne'er devis 'd seduction :— for the rest <eos> his speech discourteous , frankly he confess 'd <eos> influenc 'd with ire his lips forwent their guard <eos> he stood prepared to bide the court 's award <eos> straight from his peers were chosen judges nam 'd <eos> then fix the trial , with due forms proclaim 'd <eos> by them ‘ tis order 'd that the accus 'd assign <eos> three men for pledge , or in a prison pine <eos>
ethna , to cull sweet flowers divinely fair <eos> to seek for gems of such transparent light <eos> as would not be unworthy to unite <eos> round thy fair brow , and through thy dark brown hair <eos> i would that i had wings to cleave the air <eos> in search of some far region of delight <eos> that back to thee from that adventurous flight <eos> a glorious wreath my happy hands might bear <eos> soon would the sweetest persian rose be thine <eos> soon would the glory of golconda 's mine <eos> flash on thy forehead , like a star — ah ! me <eos> in place of these , i bring , with trembling hand <eos> these fading wild flowers from our native land <eos> these simple pebbles from the irish sea <eos>
and after further compliment and talk <eos> among the asters in the garden walk <eos> he left his guests ; and to his cottage turned <eos> and as he entered for a moment yearned <eos> for the lost splendors of the days of old <eos> the ruby glass , the silver and the gold <eos> and felt how piercing is the sting of pride <eos> by want embittered and intensified <eos> he looked about him for some means or way <eos> to keep this unexpected holiday <eos> searched every cupboard , and then searched again <eos> summoned the maid , who came , but came in vain <eos> “ the signor did not hunt to day , ” she said <eos> “ there 's nothing in the house but wine and bread <eos>
now , o'er the earth a solemn stillness ran <eos> and lull 'd alike the cares of brute and man <eos> save where the dardan leaders , nightly , hold <eos> alternate converse , and their plans unfold <eos> on one great point the council are agreed <eos> an instant message to their prince decreed <eos> each lean 'd upon the lance he well could wield <eos> and pois 'd with easy arm his ancient shield <eos> when nisus and his friend their leave request <eos> to offer something to their high behest <eos> with anxious tremors , yet unaw 'd by fear , [ v <eos> the faithful pair before the throne appear <eos> iulus greets them ; at his kind command <eos> the elder , first , address 'd the hoary band <eos>
i purposed once to take my pen and write <eos> not songs , like some , tormented and awry <eos> with passion , but a cunning harmony <eos> of words and music caught from glen and height <eos> and lucid colours born of woodland light <eos> and shining places where the sea streams lie <eos> but this was when the heat of youth glowed white <eos> and since i 've put the faded purpose by <eos> i have no faultless fruits to offer you <eos> who read this book ; but certain syllables <eos> herein are borrowed from unfooted dells <eos> and secret hollows dear to noontide dew <eos> and these at least , though far between and few <eos> may catch the sense like subtle forest spells <eos>
she told them of the fairy haunted land <eos> away the other side of brittany <eos> beyond the heaths , edged by the lonely sea <eos> of the deep forest glades of broce liande <eos> through whose green boughs the golden sunshine creeps <eos> where merlin by the enchanted thorn tree sleeps <eos> for here he came with the fay vivian <eos> one april , when the warm days first began <eos> he was on foot , and that false fay , his friend <eos> on her white palfrey ; here he met his end <eos> in these lone sylvan glades , that april day <eos> this tale of merlin and the lovely fay <eos> was the one iseult chose , and she brought clear <eos> before the children 's fancy him and her <eos>
dear unborn children , to our mother 's trust <eos> we leave you , fearless , when we lie in dust <eos> while o'er these walls the christian banner waves <eos> from hallowed lips shall flow the truth that saves <eos> while o'er those portals veritas you read <eos> no church shall bind you with its human creed <eos> take from the past the best its toil has won <eos> but learn betimes its slavish ruts to shun <eos> pass the old tree whose withered leaves are shed <eos> quit the old paths that error loved to tread <eos> and a new wreath of living blossoms seek <eos> a narrower pathway up a loftier peak <eos> lose not your reverence , but unmanly fear <eos> leave far behind you , all who enter here <eos>
what shapes are these and shadows without end <eos> that fill the night full as a storm of rain <eos> with myriads of dead men and women slain <eos> old with young , child with mother , friend with friend <eos> that on the deep mid wintering air impend <eos> pale yet with mortal wrath and human pain <eos> who died that this man dead now too might reign <eos> toward whom their hands point and their faces bend <eos> the ruining flood would redden earth and air <eos> if for each soul whose guiltless blood was shed <eos> there fell but one drop on this one man 's head <eos> whose soul to night stands bodiless and bare <eos> for whom our hearts give thanks who put up prayer <eos> that we have lived to say , the dog is dead <eos>
thine incarnation was upon this wise <eos> saviour ; and out of east and west were led <eos> to thy foul cradle by thy planet red <eos> shepherds of souls that feed their sheep with lies <eos> till the utter soul die as the body dies <eos> and the wise men that ask but to be fed <eos> though the hot shambles be their board and bed <eos> and sleep on any dunghill shut their eyes <eos> so they lie warm and fatten in the mire <eos> and the high priest enthroned yet in thy name <eos> judas , baptised thee with men 's blood for hire <eos> and now thou hangest nailed to thine own shame <eos> in sight of all time , but while heaven has flame <eos> shalt find no resurrection from hell fire <eos>
we , like the leaf , the summit , or the wave <eos> reflect the light our common nature gave <eos> but every sunbeam , falling from her throne <eos> wears on our hearts some coloring of our own <eos> chilled in the slave , and burning in the free <eos> like the sealed cavern by the sparkling sea <eos> lost , like the lightning in the sullen clod <eos> or shedding radiance , like the smiles of god <eos> pure , pale in virtue , as the star above <eos> or quivering roseate on the leaves of love <eos> glaring like noontide , where it glows upon <eos> ambition 's sands ,— the desert in the sun <eos> or soft suffusing o'er the varied scene <eos> life 's common coloring ,— intellectual green <eos>
my mistress ’ eyes are nothing like the sun <eos> coral is far more red , than her lips red <eos> if snow be white , why then her breasts are dun <eos> if hairs be wires , black wires grow on her head <eos> i have seen roses damasked , red and white <eos> but no such roses see i in her cheeks <eos> and in some perfumes is there more delight <eos> than in the breath that from my mistress reeks <eos> i love to hear her speak , yet well i know <eos> that music hath a far more pleasing sound <eos> i grant i never saw a goddess go <eos> my mistress when she walks treads on the ground <eos> and yet by heaven i think my love as rare <eos> as any she belied with false compare <eos>
far yonder , where orchards and gardens lie <eos> and dwellings cluster , ‘ tis there men die <eos> they are born , they die , and are buried near <eos> where the populous graveyard lightens the bier <eos> for strict and close are the ties that bind <eos> in death the children of human kind <eos> yea , stricter and closer than those of life <eos> ‘ tis a neighborhood that knows no strife <eos> they are noiselessly gathered — friend and foe <eos> to the still and dark assemblies below <eos> without a frown or a smile they meet <eos> each pale and calm in his winding sheet <eos> in that sullen home of peace and gloom <eos> crowded , like guests in a banquet room <eos>
when tedious much and over weary long <eos> cruel disdain reflecting from her brow <eos> hath been the cause that i endured such wrong <eos> and rest thus discontent and weary now <eos> yet when posterity in time to come <eos> shall find th ’ uncancelled tenour of her vow <eos> and her disdain be then confessed of some <eos> how much unkind and long , i find it now <eos> o yet even then — though then will be too late <eos> to comfort me ; dead , many a day , ere then <eos> they shall confess i did not force her heart <eos> and time shall make it known to other men <eos> that ne'er had her disdain made me despair <eos> had she not been so excellently fair <eos>
a golden column next in rank appear 'd <eos> on which a shrine of purest gold was rear 'd <eos> finish 'd the whole , and labour 'd every part <eos> with patient touches of unwearied art <eos> the mantuan there in sober triumph sate <eos> composed his posture , and his look sedate <eos> on homer still he fix 'd a reverend eye <eos> great without pride , in modest majesty <eos> in living sculpture on the sides were spread <eos> the latian wars , and haughty turnus dead <eos> eliza stretch 'd upon the funeral pyre <eos> aeneas bending with his aged sire <eos> troy flamed in burning gold , and o'er the throne <eos> arms and the man in golden cyphers shone <eos>
not that i love thy children , whose dull eyes <eos> see nothing save their own unlovely woe <eos> whose minds know nothing , nothing care to know <eos> but that the roar of thy democracies <eos> thy reigns of terror , thy great anarchies <eos> mirror my wildest passions like the sea <eos> and give my rage a brother —! liberty <eos> for this sake only do thy dissonant cries <eos> delight my discreet soul , else might all kings <eos> by bloody knout or treacherous cannonades <eos> rob nations of their rights inviolate <eos> and i remain unmoved — and yet , and yet <eos> these christs that die upon the barricades <eos> god knows it i am with them , in some things <eos>
xi . and so thou neededst not our human skill <eos> to fix what thus were transient — there it grew <eos> wedded to thy perfection ; and anew <eos> with every coming vision rose there still <eos> some living principle which did fulfil <eos> thy most legitimate manhood ; and unto <eos> thy soul all nature rendered up its due <eos> with not a contradiction ; and each hill <eos> and mountain torrent and each wandering light <eos> grew out divinely on thy countenance <eos> whereon , as we are told , by word and glance <eos> thy hearers read an ever strange delight — so <eos> strange to them thy truth , they could not tell <eos> what made thy message so unspeakable <eos>
how can my muse want subject to invent <eos> while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse <eos> thine own sweet argument , too excellent <eos> for every vulgar paper to rehearse <eos> o give thy self the thanks if aught in me <eos> worthy perusal stand against thy sight <eos> for who 's so dumb that cannot write to thee <eos> when thou thy self dost give invention light <eos> be thou the tenth muse , ten times more in worth <eos> than those old nine which rhymers invocate <eos> and he that calls on thee , let him bring forth <eos> eternal numbers to outlive long date <eos> if my slight muse do please these curious days <eos> the pain be mine , but thine shall be the praise <eos>
around the rocky headlands , far and near <eos> the wakened ocean murmured with dull tongue <eos> till all the coast 's mysterious caverns rung <eos> with the waves ’ voice , barbaric , hoarse , and drear <eos> within this distant valley , with rapt ear <eos> i listened , thrilled , as though a spirit sung <eos> or some gray god , as when the world was young <eos> moaned to his fellow , mad with rage or fear <eos> thus in the dark , ere the first dawn , methought <eos> the sea 's deep roar and sullen surge and shock <eos> broke the long silence of eternity <eos> and echoed from the summits where god wrought <eos> building the world , and ploughing the steep rock <eos> with ploughs of ice hills harnessed to the sea <eos>
the husband ev'ry way was armed so well <eos> he four such men as andrew could repel <eos> in quest of succour howsoe'er he went <eos> to kill him surely william never meant <eos> but only take an ear , or what the turks <eos> those savage beasts , cut off from nature 's works <eos> which doubtless must be infinitely worse <eos> infernal practice and continual curse <eos> ‘ twas this he whispered should be andrew 's doom <eos> when with his easy wife he left the room <eos> she nothing durst reply : the door he shut <eos> and our gallant ‘ gan presently to strut <eos> around and round , believing all was right <eos> and william unacquainted with his plight <eos>
look , how the flower which ling'ringly doth fade <eos> the morning 's darling late , the summer 's queen <eos> spoil 'd of that juice which kept it fresh and green <eos> as high as it did raise , bows low the head <eos> right so the pleasures of my life being dead <eos> or in their contraries but only seen <eos> with swifter speed declines than erst it spread <eos> and , blasted , scarce now shows what it hath been <eos> as doth the pilgrim , therefore , whom the night <eos> by darkness would imprison on his way <eos> think on thy home , my soul , and think aright <eos> of what 's yet left thee of life 's wasting day <eos> thy sun posts westward , passed is thy morn <eos> and twice it is not given thee to be born <eos>
the earth renewed presents a glorious scene <eos> mountains and valleys of perpetual green <eos> delicious plains , and odoriferous bowers <eos> unfading forests , never dying flowers <eos> fruits that on fragrant trees immortal grow <eos> rivers that murmur sweetly as they flow <eos> and gardens decked with everlasting spring <eos> and shining warblers on the tireless wing <eos> no howling tempest breaks the sweet repose <eos> no piercing thorn surrounds the blushing rose <eos> no sultry heat parches those blooming plains <eos> no night is known where day forever reigns <eos> no thunder 's roar , no lightning 's vivid glare <eos> no darkened sky , disturbs the beauty there <eos>
when midnight comes a host of dogs and men <eos> go out and track the badger to his den <eos> and put a sack within the hole , and lie <eos> till the old grunting badger passes bye <eos> he comes and hears — they let the strongest loose <eos> the old fox hears the noise and drops the goose <eos> the poacher shoots and hurries from the cry <eos> and the old hare half wounded buzzes bye <eos> they get a forked stick to bear him down <eos> and clap the dogs and take him to the town <eos> and bait him all the day with many dogs <eos> and laugh and shout and fright the scampering hogs <eos> he runs along and bites at all he meets <eos> they shout and hollo down the noisy streets <eos>
“ ‘ are you alive , o goddess born ? ’ she said <eos> ‘ or if a ghost , then where is hector 's shade <eos> at this , she cast a loud and frightful cry <eos> with broken words i made this brief reply <eos> ‘ all of me that remains appears in sight <eos> i live , if living be to loathe the light <eos> no phantom ; but i drag a wretched life <eos> my fate resembling that of hector 's wife <eos> what have you suffer 'd since you lost your lord <eos> by what strange blessing are you now restor 'd <eos> still are you hector 's ? or is hector fled <eos> and his remembrance lost in pyrrhus ’ bed <eos> with eyes dejected , in a lowly tone <eos> after a modest pause she thus begun <eos>
the fair hair 'd boy is at his mother 's knee <eos> a many colour 'd page before them spread <eos> gay summer harvest field of gold and red <eos> with lines and staves of ancient minstrelsy <eos> but through her eyes alone the child can see <eos> from her sweet lips partake the words of song <eos> and looks as one who feels a hidden wrong <eos> or gazes on some feat of gramarye <eos> ‘ when thou canst use it , thine the book ! ’ she cried <eos> he blush 'd , and clasp 'd it to his breast with pride <eos> ‘ unkingly task ! ’ his comrades cry ; in vain <eos> all work ennobles nobleness , all art <eos> he sees ; head governs hand ; and in his heart <eos> all knowledge for his province he has ta'en <eos>
then , first aroused in that appointed hour <eos> the tragic muse confess 'd th ’ inspiring power <eos> sudden before the startled earth she stood <eos> a giant spectre , weeping tears and blood <eos> guilt shrunk appall 'd , despair embraced his shroud <eos> and terror shriek 'd , and pity sobb 'd aloud <eos> then , first thalia with dilated ken <eos> and quicken 'd footstep pierced the walks of men <eos> then folly blush 'd , vice fled the general hiss <eos> delight met reason with a loving kiss <eos> at satire 's glance pride smooth 'd his low'ring crest <eos> the graces weaved the dance .— and last and best <eos> came momus down in falstaff 's form to earth <eos> to make the world one universe of mirth <eos>
the morn was wasted in the pathless grass <eos> and long and lonesome was the wild to pass <eos> but when the southern sun had warm 'd the day <eos> a youth came posting o'er a crossing way <eos> his raiment decent , his complexion fair <eos> and soft in graceful ringlets waved his hair <eos> then near approaching , ‘ father , hail ! ’ he cried <eos> ‘ and hail , my son ! ’ the reverend sire replied <eos> words follow 'd words , from question answer flow 'd <eos> and talk of various kind deceived the road <eos> till each with other pleased , and loth to part <eos> while in their age they differ , join in heart <eos> thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound <eos> thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around <eos>
my cares draw on mine everlasting night <eos> in horror 's sable clouds sets my life 's sun <eos> my life 's sweet sun , my dearest comfort 's light <eos> shall rise no more to me whose day is done <eos> i 'll go before unto the myrtle shades <eos> t'attend the presence of my world 's dear <eos> and there prepare her flowers that never fades <eos> and all things fit against her coming there <eos> if any ask me why so soon i came <eos> i 'll hide her sin and say it was my lot <eos> in life and death i 'll tender her good name <eos> my life nor death shall never be her blot <eos> although this world may seem her deed to blame <eos> the elysian ghosts shall never know the same <eos>
he hurries to his tent ;— oh rage ! despair <eos> no glimpse , no tidings of the frantic fair <eos> save that some carmen , as acamp they drove <eos> had seen her coursing for the western grove <eos> faint with fatigue and choked with burning thirst <eos> forth from his friends with bounding leap he burst <eos> vaults o'er the palisade with eyes on flame <eos> and fills the welkin with lucinda 's name <eos> swift thro the wild wood paths phrenetic springs <eos> lucind ! lucinda ! thro the wild wood rings <eos> all night he wanders ; barking wolves alone <eos> and screaming night birds answer to his moan <eos> for war had roused them from their savage den <eos> they scent the field , they snuff the walks of men <eos>
ser federigo thought not of the chase <eos> the tender vision of her lovely face <eos> i will not say he seems to see , he sees <eos> in the leaf shadows of the trellises <eos> herself , yet not herself ; a lovely child <eos> with flowing tresses , and eyes wide and wild <eos> coming undaunted up the garden walk <eos> and looking not at him , but at the hawk <eos> “ beautiful falcon ! ” said he , “ would that i <eos> might hold thee on my wrist , or see thee fly <eos> the voice was hers , and made strange echoes start <eos> through all the haunted chambers of his heart <eos> as an æ olian harp through gusty doors <eos> of some old ruin its wild music pours <eos>
what 's in the brain that ink may character <eos> which hath not figured to thee my true spirit <eos> what 's new to speak , what now to register <eos> that may express my love , or thy dear merit <eos> nothing sweet boy , but yet like prayers divine <eos> i must each day say o'er the very same <eos> counting no old thing old , thou mine , i thine <eos> even as when first i hallowed thy fair name <eos> so that eternal love in love 's fresh case <eos> weighs not the dust and injury of age <eos> nor gives to necessary wrinkles place <eos> but makes antiquity for aye his page <eos> finding the first conceit of love there bred <eos> where time and outward form would show it dead <eos>
“ an upstart multitude and sudden gains <eos> pride and excess , o florence ! have in thee <eos> engender 'd , so that now in tears thou mourn'st <eos> thus cried i with my face uprais 'd , and they <eos> all three , who for an answer took my words <eos> look 'd at each other , as men look when truth <eos> comes to their ear . “ if thou at other times <eos> they all at once rejoin 'd , “ so easily <eos> satisfy those , who question , happy thou <eos> gifted with words , so apt to speak thy thought <eos> wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime <eos> returning to behold the radiant stars <eos> when thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past <eos> see that of us thou speak among mankind <eos>
“ this circuit , ” said my teacher , “ knots the scourge <eos> for envy , and the cords are therefore drawn <eos> by charity 's correcting hand . the curb <eos> is of a harsher sound , as thou shalt hear <eos> ( if i deem rightly ) , ere thou reach the pass <eos> where pardon sets them free . but fix thine eyes <eos> intently through the air , and thou shalt see <eos> a multitude before thee seated , each <eos> along the shelving grot . ” then more than erst <eos> i op 'd my eyes , before me view 'd , and saw <eos> shadows with garments dark as was the rock <eos> and when we pass 'd a little forth , i heard <eos> a crying , “ blessed mary ! pray for us <eos> michael and peter ! all ye saintly host <eos>
o poet 's city ! one who scarce has seen <eos> some twenty summers cast their doublets green <eos> for autumn 's livery , would seek in vain <eos> to wake his lyre to sing a louder strain <eos> or tell thy days of glory ;— poor indeed <eos> is the low murmur of the shepherd 's reed <eos> where the loud clarion 's blast should shake the sky <eos> and flame across the heavens ! and to try <eos> such lofty themes were folly : yet i know <eos> that never felt my heart a nobler glow <eos> than when i woke the silence of thy street <eos> with clamorous trampling of my horse 's feet <eos> and saw the city which now i try to sing <eos> after long days of weary travelling <eos>
the dewy roseate morn had with her hairs <eos> in sundry sorts the indian clime adorned <eos> and now her eyes apparrel è d in tears <eos> the loss of lovely memnon long had mourned <eos> when as she spied the nymph whom i admire <eos> combing her locks , of which the yellow gold <eos> made blush the beauties of her curl è d wire <eos> which heaven itself with wonder might behold <eos> then red with shame , her reverend locks she rent <eos> and weeping hid the beauty of her face <eos> the flower of fancy wrought such discontent <eos> the sighs which midst the air she breathed a space <eos> a three days ’ stormy tempest did maintain <eos> her shame a fire , her eyes a swelling rain <eos>
a hurry of hoofs in a village street <eos> a shape in the moonlight , a bulk in the dark <eos> and beneath , from the pebbles , in passing , a spark <eos> struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet <eos> that was all ! and yet , through the gloom and the light <eos> the fate of a nation was riding that night <eos> and the spark struck out by that steed , in his flight <eos> kindled the land into flame with its heat <eos> he has left the village and mounted the steep <eos> and beneath him , tranquil and broad and deep <eos> is the mystic , meeting the ocean tides <eos> and under the alders , that skirt its edge <eos> now soft on the sand , now loud on the ledge <eos> is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides <eos>
well , if a king 's a lion , at the least <eos> the people are a many headed beast <eos> can they direct what measures to pursue <eos> who know themselves so little what to do <eos> alike in nothing but one lust of gold <eos> just half the land would buy , and half be sold <eos> their country 's wealth our mightier misers drain <eos> or cross , to plunder provinces , the main <eos> the rest , some farm the poor box , some the pews <eos> some keep assemblies , and would keep the stews <eos> some with fat bucks on childless dotards fawn <eos> some win rich widows by their chine and brawn <eos> while with the silent growth of ten per cent <eos> in dirt and darkness , hundreds stink content <eos>
say , whence , obedient , to their destin 'd end <eos> the various tribes of living nature tend <eos> why beast , and bird , and all the countless race <eos> of earth and waters , each his proper place <eos> instinctive knows , and through the endless chain <eos> of being moves in one harmonious strain <eos> while man alone , with strange perversion , draws <eos> rebellious fame from nature 's broken laws <eos> methinks i hear , in that still voice which stole <eos> on horeb 's mount o'er rapt elijah 's soul <eos> with stern reproof indignant heaven reply <eos> ‘ tis o'erweening pride , that blinds the eye <eos> of reasoning man , and o'er his darkened life <eos> confusion spreads and misery and strife <eos>
who framed the stanza of childe harold ? he <eos> it was who , halting on a stormy shore <eos> knew well the lofty voice which evermore <eos> in grand distress , doth haunt the sleepless sea <eos> with solemn sounds . and as each wave did roll <eos> till one came up , the mightiest of the whole <eos> to sweep and surge across the vacant lea <eos> wild words were wedded to wild melody <eos> this poet must have had a speechless sense <eos> of some dead summer 's boundless affluence <eos> else , whither can we trace the passioned lore <eos> of beauty , steeping to the very core <eos> his royal verse , and that rare light which lies <eos> about it , like a sunset in the skies <eos>
because the shadows deepened verily <eos> because the end of all seemed near , forsooth <eos> her gracious spirit , ever quick to ruth <eos> had pity on her bond slave , even on me <eos> she came in with the twilight noiselessly <eos> fair as a rose , immaculate as truth <eos> she leaned above my wrecked and wasted youth <eos> i felt her presence , which i could not see <eos> “ god keep you , my poor friend , ” i heard her say <eos> and then she kissed my dry , hot lips and eyes <eos> kiss thou the next kiss , quiet death , i pray <eos> be instant on this hour , and so surprise <eos> my spirit while the vision seems to stay <eos> take thou the heart with the heart 's paradise <eos>

prais 'd be the poet , who the sonnet 's claim <eos> severest of the orders that belong <eos> distinct and separate to the delphic song <eos> shall venerate , nor its appropriate name <eos> lawless assume . peculiar is its frame <eos> from him deriv 'd , who shunn 'd the city throng <eos> and warbled sweet thy rocks and streams among <eos> lonely valclusa !— and that heir of fame <eos> our greater milton , hath , by many a lay <eos> form 'd on that arduous model , fully shown <eos> that english verse may happily display <eos> those strict energic measures , which alone <eos> deserve the name of sonnet , and convey <eos> a grandeur , grace and spirit , all their own <eos>
to me fair friend you never can be old <eos> for as you were when first your eye i eyed <eos> such seems your beauty still : three winters cold <eos> have from the forests shook three summers ’ pride <eos> three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned <eos> in process of the seasons have i seen <eos> three april perfumes in three hot junes burned <eos> since first i saw you fresh which yet are green <eos> ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand <eos> steal from his figure , and no pace perceived <eos> so your sweet hue , which methinks still doth stand <eos> hath motion , and mine eye may be deceived <eos> for fear of which , hear this thou age unbred <eos> ere you were born was beauty 's summer dead <eos>
he is afraid , seeing her lie so still <eos> so utterly his own ; afraid lest she <eos> should open wide her eyes and let him see <eos> the passionate conquest of her virgin will <eos> shine there in triumph , starry bright with tears <eos> he thrusts her from him : face and hair and breast <eos> hands he had touched , lips that his lips had pressed <eos> seem things deadly to be desired . he fears <eos> lest she should body forth in palpable shame <eos> those dreams and longings that his blood , aflame <eos> through the hot dark of summer nights , had dreamed <eos> and longed . must all his love , then , turn to this <eos> was lust the end of what so pure had seemed <eos> he must escape , ah god ! her touch , her kiss <eos>
these hearts were woven of human joys and cares <eos> washed marvellously with sorrow , swift to mirth <eos> the years had given them kindness . dawn was theirs <eos> and sunset , and the colours of the earth <eos> these had seen movement and heard music ; known <eos> slumber and waking ; loved ; gone proudly friended <eos> felt the quick stir of wonder ; sat alone <eos> touched flowers and furs and cheeks . all this is ended <eos> there are waters blown by changing winds to laughter <eos> and lit by the rich skies , all day . and after <eos> frost , with a gesture , stays the waves that dance <eos> and wandering loveliness . he leaves a white <eos> unbroken glory , a gathered radiance <eos> a width , a shining peace , under the night <eos>
we ask that love shall rise to the divine <eos> and yet we crave him very human , too <eos> our hearts would drain the crimson of his wine <eos> our souls despise him if he prove untrue <eos> poor love ! i hardly see what you can do <eos> we know all human things are weak and frail <eos> and yet we claim that very part of you <eos> then , inconsistent , blame you if you fail <eos> when you would soar , ‘ t is we who clip your wings <eos> although we weep because you faint and fall <eos> alas ! it seems we want so many things <eos> that no dear love could ever grant them all <eos> which shall we choose , the human or divine <eos> the crystal stream , or yet the crimson wine <eos>
speak thou , whose thoughts at humble peace repine <eos> shall wolsey 's wealth , with wolsey 's end , be thine <eos> or liv'st thou now , with safer pride content <eos> the wisest justice on the banks of trent <eos> for why did wolsey , near the steeps of fate <eos> on weak foundations raise the enormous weight <eos> why but to sink beneath misfortune 's blow <eos> with louder ruin , to the gulphs below <eos> what gave great villiers to the assassin 's knife <eos> and fix 'd disease on harley 's closing life <eos> what murder 'd wentworth , and what exiled hyde <eos> by kings protected , and to kings allied <eos> what but their wish indulged , in courts to shine <eos> and power too great to keep , or to resign <eos>
he said , and ‘ mid the general rout , to flight <eos> he turn 'd his horses ; on the flying crowd <eos> with shouts of triumph , hector at their head <eos> the men of troy their murd'rous weapons show'r ' d <eos> loud shouted hector of the glancing helm <eos> “ tydides , heretofore the warrior greeks <eos> have held thee in much honour ; plac 'd on high <eos> at banquets , and with lib'ral portions grac 'd <eos> and flowing cups : but thou , from this day forth <eos> shalt be their scorn ! a woman 's soul is thine <eos> out on thee , frighten 'd girl ! thou ne'er shalt scale <eos> our trojan tow'rs , and see me basely fly <eos> nor in thy ships our women bear away <eos> ere such thy boast , my hand shall work thy doom <eos>
if e'er the sacred poem that hath made <eos> both heav'n and earth copartners in its toil <eos> and with lean abstinence , through many a year <eos> faded my brow , be destin 'd to prevail <eos> over the cruelty , which bars me forth <eos> of the fair sheep fold , where a sleeping lamb <eos> the wolves set on and fain had worried me <eos> with other voice and fleece of other grain <eos> i shall forthwith return , and , standing up <eos> at my baptismal font , shall claim the wreath <eos> due to the poet 's temples : for i there <eos> first enter 'd on the faith which maketh souls <eos> acceptable to god : and , for its sake <eos> peter had then circled my forehead thus <eos>
meanwhile the city rings with busy stir <eos> the streets are swept and sprinkled with perfumes <eos> and when the evening shades had veiled the earth <eos> and heaven 's blue vault was set with myriad stars <eos> the promised signal from the watchtower sounds <eos> and myriad lamps shine from each house and tree <eos> and merry children strew their way with flowers <eos> and all come forth to greet siddartha 's bride <eos> and welcome her , their second maya , home <eos> and at the palace gate the good old king <eos> receives her with such loving tenderness <eos> as fondest mother , sick with hope deferred <eos> waiting and watching for an absent child <eos> at length receives him in her open arms <eos>
i see in vision the warm lighted hall <eos> the living and the dead i see again <eos> and but my chair is empty ; ‘ mid them all <eos> ‘ tis i that seem the dead : they all remain <eos> immortal , changeless creatures of the brain <eos> wellnigh i doubt which world is real most <eos> of sense or spirit to the truly sane <eos> in this abstraction it were light to deem <eos> myself the figment of some stronger dream <eos> they are the real things , and i the ghost <eos> that glide unhindered through the solid door <eos> vainly for recognition seek from chair to chair <eos> and strive to speak and am but futile air <eos> as truly most of us are little more <eos>
the husband ev'ry way was armed so well <eos> he four such men as andrew could repel <eos> in quest of succour howsoe'er he went <eos> to kill him surely william never meant <eos> but only take an ear , or what the turks <eos> those savage beasts , cut off from nature 's works <eos> which doubtless must be infinitely worse <eos> infernal practice and continual curse <eos> ‘ twas this he whispered should be andrew 's doom <eos> when with his easy wife he left the room <eos> she nothing durst reply : the door he shut <eos> and our gallant ‘ gan presently to strut <eos> around and round , believing all was right <eos> and william unacquainted with his plight <eos>

when she comes home again ! a thousand ways <eos> i fashion , to myself , the tenderness <eos> of my glad welcome : i shall tremble — yes <eos> and touch her , as when first in the old days <eos> i touched her girlish hand , nor dared upraise <eos> mine eyes , such was my faint heart 's sweet distress <eos> then silence : and the perfume of her dress <eos> the room will sway a little , and a haze <eos> cloy eyesight — soulsight , even — for a space <eos> and tears — yes ; and the ache here in the throat <eos> to know that i so ill deserve the place <eos> her arms make for me ; and the sobbing note <eos> i stay with kisses , ere the tearful face <eos> again is hidden in the old embrace <eos>
he spoke , a nymph close girt like dian 's train <eos> her ample tresses o'er each shoulder spread <eos> enter 'd , supporting all of autumn 's fruit <eos> in the rich horn , and mellowest apples came <eos> the second course to grace . now day appear 'd <eos> the youths when light the loftiest summits touch 'd <eos> of the high hills , departed ; waiting not <eos> till the rough floods in peaceful channels flow 'd <eos> the troubled currents smooth 'd . profound his head <eos> of rustic semblance , achelo ü s hides <eos> ‘ reft of his horn , beneath his deepest waves <eos> his forehead 's honor lost sore gall 'd him : all <eos> save that was perfect . ev'n his forehead 's loss <eos> with willow boughs and marshy reeds was hid <eos>
great master ! teach us how to hope in man <eos> we lift our eyes upon his works and ways <eos> and disappointment chills us as we gaze <eos> our dream of him so far the truth outran <eos> so far his deeds are ever falling short <eos> and then we fold our graceful hands and say <eos> “ the world is vulgar . ” didst thou turn away <eos> o sacred spirit , delicately wrought <eos> because the humble souls of galilee <eos> were tuned not to the music of thine own <eos> and chimed not to the pulsing undertone <eos> which swelled thy loving bosom like the sea <eos> shame thou our coldness , most benignant friend <eos> when we so daintily do condescend <eos>
your love and pity doth th ’ impression fill <eos> which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow <eos> for what care i who calls me well or ill <eos> so you o'erhyppphengreen my bad , my good allow <eos> you are my all the world , and i must strive <eos> to know my shames and praises from your tongue <eos> none else to me , nor i to none alive <eos> that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong <eos> in so profound abysm i throw all care <eos> of others ’ voices , that my adder 's sense <eos> to critic and to flatterer stopped are <eos> mark how with my neglect i do dispense <eos> you are so strongly in my purpose bred <eos> that all the world besides methinks are dead <eos>
the twins worked the wheel an ’ huldy steered <eos> an ’ pinkie clung tight — she was awfully skeered <eos> they got back home at half past six <eos> but , oh ! they got into a nawful fix <eos> for just as they sunk the house gave a lurch <eos> an ’ they landed right on top of a church <eos> an ’ they punched a hole through the roof with the steeple <eos> to the great amazement of all of the people <eos> an ’ the toys fell out of that house in the air <eos> an ’ all the children in the town was there <eos> so every one got a present again <eos> ‘ cept willie an ’ wallie an ’ huldy an ’ jane <eos> an ’ it served ‘ em right , do n't you think ? because <eos> they 'd stolen the presents from santa clause <eos>
my love for thee doth march like armed men <eos> against a queenly city they would take <eos> along the army 's front its banners shake <eos> across the mountain and the sun smit plain <eos> it steadfast sweeps as sweeps the steadfast rain <eos> and now the trumpet makes the still air quake <eos> and now the thundering cannon doth awake <eos> echo on echo , echoing loud again <eos> but , lo ! the conquest higher than bard e'er sung <eos> instead of answering cannon , proud surrender <eos> joyful the iron gates are open flung <eos> and , for the conqueror , welcome gay and tender <eos> o , bright the invader 's path with tribute flowers <eos> while comrade flags flame forth on wall and towers <eos>
hadst thou been such as , boasting of their birth <eos> pass by the humbler born with proud disdain <eos> making self merit of the antique worth <eos> whereby some sire that state for them did gain <eos> had riches ’ dross so reign 'd in thy respect <eos> that riches ’ lack were deem 'd by thee disgrace <eos> of thy rare parts had ‘ t been the rude effect <eos> that cruel pride held gentle pity 's place <eos> then would'st thou ne'er have look 'd on lowly me <eos> to find what merit there thou might'st approve <eos> nor would my heart , grown warm for haughty thee <eos> dare or desire to clamour for thy love <eos> but all thy gifts were made more rich , more rare <eos> by inward sweetness kind beyond compare <eos>
a black and glassy float , opaque and still <eos> the loch , at furthest ebb supine in sleep <eos> reversing , mirrored in its luminous deep <eos> the calm grey skies ; the solemn spurs of hill <eos> heather , and corn , and wisps of loitering haze <eos> the wee white cots , black hatted , plumed with smoke <eos> the braes beyond — and when the ripple awoke <eos> they wavered with the jarred and wavering glaze <eos> the air was hushed and dreamy . evermore <eos> a noise of running water whispered near <eos> a straggling crow called high and thin . a bird <eos> trilled from the birch leaves . round the shingled shore <eos> yellow with weed , there wandered , vague and clear <eos> strange vowels , mysterious gutturals , idly heard <eos>
there is a race which cold , ungenial skies <eos> breed from decay , as fungous growths arise <eos> though dying fast , yet springing fast again <eos> which still usurps an unsubstantial reign <eos> with frames too languid for the charms of sense <eos> and minds worn down with action too intense <eos> tired of a world whose joys they never knew <eos> themselves deceived , yet thinking all untrue <eos> scarce men without , and less than girls within <eos> sick of their life before its cares begin <eos> the dull disease , which drains their feeble hearts <eos> to life 's decay some hectic thrill 's imparts <eos> and lends a force which , like the maniac 's power <eos> pays with blank years the frenzy of an hour <eos>
mysterious nothing ! how shall i define <eos> thy shapeless , baseless , placeless emptiness <eos> nor form , nor colour , sound , nor size is thine <eos> nor words nor fingers can thy voice express <eos> but though we cannot thee to aught compare <eos> a thousand things to thee may likened be <eos> and though thou art with nobody nowhere <eos> yet half mankind devote themselves to thee <eos> how many books thy history contain <eos> how many heads thy mighty plans pursue <eos> what labouring hands thy portion only gain <eos> what busy bodies thy doings only do <eos> to thee the great , the proud , the giddy bend <eos> and — like my sonnet — all in nothing end <eos>
a child of brighter than the morning 's birth <eos> and lovelier than all smiles that may be smiled <eos> save only of little children undefiled <eos> sweet , perfect , witless of their own dear worth <eos> live rose of love , mute melody of mirth <eos> glad as a bird is when the woods are mild <eos> adorable as is nothing save a child <eos> hails with wide eyes and lips his life on earth <eos> his lovely life with all its heaven to be <eos> and whoso reads the name inscribed or hears <eos> feels his own heart a frozen well of tears <eos> child , for deep dread and fearful pity of thee <eos> whom god would not let rather die than see <eos> the incumbent horror of impending years <eos>
another that with prudence , and with cares <eos> has mannag 'd well his family affairs <eos> govern 'd his wife and children with that ease <eos> which always kept the family in peace <eos> his sons and daughters educated so <eos> none better bred , none cou 'd gentiler go <eos> the sons are now set up to drive their trade <eos> the daughters married , and their fortunes paid <eos> one son runs out , another takes ill ways <eos> for which their father 's pocket always pays <eos> the daughter 's husband breaks , and she must come <eos> and live a burthen on him again at home <eos> until the daily cares that they impart <eos> break first his substance , and then break his heart <eos>

once more into my arid days like dew <eos> like wind from an oasis , or the sound <eos> of cold sweet water bubbling underground <eos> a treacherous messenger , the thought of you <eos> comes to destroy me ; once more i renew <eos> firm faith in your abundance , whom i found <eos> long since to be but just one other mound <eos> of sand , whereon no green thing ever grew <eos> and once again , and wiser in no wise <eos> i chase your colored phantom on the air <eos> and sob and curse and fall and weep and rise <eos> and stumble pitifully on to where <eos> miserable and lost , with stinging eyes <eos> once more i clasp ,— and there is nothing there <eos>
“ what words are these , and what imprudence thine <eos> ( thus interposed the martial maid divine <eos> forgetful youth ! but know , the power above <eos> with ease can save each object of his love <eos> wide as his will , extends his boundless grace <eos> nor lost in time nor circumscribed by place <eos> happier his lot , who , many sorrows ’ pass 'd <eos> long labouring gains his natal shore at last <eos> than who , too speedy , hastes to end his life <eos> by some stern ruffian , or adulterous wife <eos> death only is the lot which none can miss <eos> and all is possible to heaven but this <eos> the best , the dearest favourite of the sky <eos> must taste that cup , for man is born to die <eos>
i like her gentle hand that sometimes strays <eos> to find the place , through the same book with mine <eos> i like her feet ; and o , those eyes divine <eos> and when we say farewell , perhaps she stays <eos> love lingering — then hurries on her ways <eos> as if she thought , “ to end my pain and thine <eos> i like her voice better than new made wine <eos> i like the mandolin whereon she plays <eos> and i like , too , the cloak i saw her wear <eos> and the red scarf that her white neck doth cover <eos> and well i like the door that she comes through <eos> i like the ribbon that doth bind her hair <eos> but then , in truth , i am that lady 's lover <eos> and every new day there is something new <eos>
among the folks , to whom he visits paid <eos> was neighbour peter , one who used the spade <eos> a villager that god , in lieu of lands <eos> had furnished only with a pair of hands <eos> to dig and delve , and by the mattock gain <eos> enough his wife and children to maintain <eos> still youthful charms you in his spouse might trace <eos> the weather injured solely had her face <eos> but not the features which were perfect yet <eos> some wish perhaps more blooming belles to get <eos> the rustick truly me would ne'er have pleased <eos> but such are oft by country parsons seized <eos> who low amours and dishes coarse admire <eos> that palates more refined would not desire <eos>
o solitude ! if i must with thee dwell <eos> let it not be among the jumbled heap <eos> of murky buildings ; climb with me the steep <eos> nature 's observatory — whence the dell <eos> its flowery slopes , its river 's crystal swell <eos> may seem a span ; let me thy vigils keep <eos> ‘ mongst boughs pavillion 'd , where the deer 's swift leap <eos> startles the wild bee from the fox glove bell <eos> but though i 'll gladly trace these scenes with thee <eos> yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind <eos> whose words are images of thoughts refin 'd <eos> is my soul 's pleasure ; and it sure must be <eos> almost the highest bliss of human kind <eos> when to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee <eos>
i thought , before my sunlit twentieth year <eos> that i knew love , and death that goes with it <eos> and my young broken heart in little songs <eos> dew like , i poured , and waited for my end <eos> wildly — and waited — being then nineteen <eos> i walked a little longer on my way <eos> alive , ‘ gainst expectation and desire <eos> and , being then past twenty , i beheld <eos> the face of all the faces of the world <eos> dewily opening on its stem for me <eos> ah ! so it seemed , and , each succeeding year <eos> thus hath some woman blossom of the divine <eos> flowered in my path , and made a frail delay <eos> in my true journey — to my home in thee <eos>
sybil of months , and worshipper of winds <eos> i love thee , rude and boisterous as thou art <eos> and scraps of joy my wandering ever finds <eos> mid thy uproarious madness — when the start <eos> of sudden tempests stirs the forest leaves <eos> into hoarse fury , till the shower set free <eos> stills the huge swells . then ebb the mighty heaves <eos> that sway the forest like a troubled sea <eos> i love thy wizard noise , and rave in turn <eos> half vacant thoughts and rhymes of careless form <eos> then hide me from the shower , a short sojourn <eos> neath ivied oak ; and mutter to the storm <eos> wishing its melody belonged to me <eos> that i might breathe a living song to thee <eos>
enough ! enough ! i will no longer hear <eos> the ill boding note which frantic hatred sounds <eos> to affright a fortune which the gods secure <eos> once more my friendship thou rejectest ; well <eos> more for this land 's sake grieve i , than mine own <eos> i chafe not with thee , that thy hate endures <eos> nor bend myself too low , to make it yield <eos> what i have done is done ; by my own deed <eos> neither exulting nor ashamed , i stand <eos> why should this heart of mine set mighty store <eos> by the construction and report of men <eos> not men 's good word hath made me what i am <eos> alone i master 'd power ; and alone <eos> since so thou wilt , i dare maintain it still <eos>
in english ale their dear enjoyment lies <eos> for which they starve themselves and families <eos> an englishman will fairly drink as much <eos> as will maintain two families of dutch <eos> subjecting all their labours to the pots <eos> the greatest artists are the greatest sots <eos> the country poor do by example live <eos> the gentry lead them , and the clergy drive <eos> what may we not from such examples hope <eos> the landlord is their god , the priest their pope <eos> a drunken clergy , and a swearing bench <eos> has given the reformation such a drench <eos> as wise men think , there is some cause to doubt <eos> will purge good manners and religion out <eos>
‘ tis a cruel creed , believe it not <eos> death to the good is a milder lot <eos> they are here ,— they are here ,— that harmless pair <eos> in the yellow sunshine and flowing air <eos> in the light cloud shadows that slowly pass <eos> in the sounds that rise from the murmuring grass <eos> they sit where their humble cottage stood <eos> they walk by the waving edge of the wood <eos> and list to the long accustomed flow <eos> of the brook that wets the rocks below <eos> patient , and peaceful , and passionless <eos> as seasons on seasons swiftly press <eos> they watch , and wait , and linger around <eos> till the day when their bodies shall leave the ground <eos>
what sudden beams dispel the clouds so fast <eos> whose drenching rains laid all our vineyards waste <eos> the spring , so far behind her course delay 'd <eos> on the instant is in all her bloom array 'd <eos> the winds breathe low , the element serene <eos> yet mark what motion in the waves is seen <eos> thronging and busy as hyblaean swarms <eos> or straggled soldiers summon 'd to their arms <eos> see where the princely bark in loosest pride <eos> with all her guardian fleet , adorns the tide <eos> high on her deck the royal lovers stand <eos> our crimes to pardon , e'er they touch 'd our land <eos> welcome to israel and to david 's breast <eos> here all your toils , here all your sufferings rest <eos>
sweet warriour ! when shall i have peace with you <eos> high time it is this warre now ended were <eos> which i no lenger can endure to sue <eos> ne your incessant battry more to beare <eos> so weake my powres , so sore my wounds , appear <eos> that wonder is how i should live a iot <eos> seeing my hart through launced every where <eos> with thousand arrowes which your eies have shot <eos> yet shoot ye sharpely still , and spare me not <eos> but glory thinke to make these cruel stoures <eos> ye cruell one ! what glory can be got <eos> in slaying him that would live gladly yours <eos> make peace therefore , and graunt me timely grace <eos> that al my wounds will heale in little space <eos>
lifelong our stumbles , lifelong our regret <eos> lifelong our efforts failing and renewed <eos> while lifelong is our witness , “ god is good <eos> who bore with us till now , bears with us yet <eos> who still remembers and will not forget <eos> who gives us light and warmth and daily food <eos> and gracious promises half understood <eos> and glories half unveiled , whereon to set <eos> our heart of hearts and eyes of our desire <eos> uplifting us to longing and to love <eos> luring us upward from this world of mire <eos> urging us to press on and mount above <eos> ourselves and all we have had experience of <eos> mounting to him in love 's perpetual fire <eos>
here , where we stood together , we three men <eos> before the war had swept us to the east <eos> three thousand miles away , i stand again <eos> and bear the bells , and breathe , and go to feast <eos> we trod the same path , to the selfsame place <eos> yet here i stand , having beheld their graves <eos> skyros whose shadows the great seas erase <eos> and seddul bahr that ever more blood craves <eos> so , since we communed here , our bones have been <eos> nearer , perhaps , than they again will be <eos> earth and the worldwide battle lie between <eos> death lies between , and friend destroying sea <eos> yet here , a year ago , we talked and stood <eos> as i stand now , with pulses beating blood <eos>
dull in the night , when the camps were still <eos> thumped two nags over good hope hill <eos> the white deserter , the passing spy <eos> took to the brush as the pair went by <eos> the army mule gave over the chase <eos> the catholic negro , hearing the pace <eos> said , as they splashed through oxon run <eos> “ dey ride like de soldiers who speared god 's son <eos> but when good friday 's bells behind <eos> died in the capital on the wind <eos> he who rode foremost paused to say <eos> “ herold , spur up to my side , scared boy <eos> a word has rung in my ears all day <eos> merely a jingle , ‘ nanjemoy <eos>
let us forget . what matters it that we <eos> once reigned o'er happy realms of long ago <eos> and talked of love , and let our voices low <eos> and ruled for some brief sessions royally <eos> what if we sung , or laughed , or wept maybe <eos> it has availed not anything , and so <eos> let it go by that we may better know <eos> how poor a thing is lost to you and me <eos> but yesterday i kissed your lips , and yet <eos> did thrill you not enough to shake the dew <eos> from your drenched lids — and missed , with no regret <eos> your kiss shot back , with sharp breaths failing you <eos> and so , to day , while our worn eyes are wet <eos> with all this waste of tears , let us forget <eos>
she , by her neighbour , was received , we 're told <eos> ‘ mid costly furniture and burnished gold <eos> we may suppose what splendour shone around <eos> when all attracting he would fain be found <eos> the best of wines ; each dish considered rare <eos> the gods themselves received not better fare <eos> till then , alaciel ne'er had tasted wine <eos> her faith forbade a liquor so divine <eos> and , unacquainted with the potent juice <eos> she much indulged at table in its use <eos> if lately love disquieted her brain <eos> new poison now pervaded ev'ry vein <eos> both fraught with danger to the beauteous fair <eos> whose charms should guarded be with ev'ry care <eos>
their daughter , jane , was in her twentieth year <eos> and did to him a lovely maid appeal <eos> he knew her soon as skilled in house affairs <eos> but ever lacking vain , coquettish airs <eos> her form was graceful , and of medium size <eos> and sweet good nature beamed in her bright eyes <eos> her face , for most part , wore a pleasant smile <eos> while her dear heart ne'er harbored aught of guile <eos> her charms were such that cooper 's heart , ere long <eos> could not resist their influence so strong <eos> nor need we wonder much , for soon he learned <eos> she had good offers , in great plenty , spurned <eos> before she knew the tinsmith — so forlorn <eos> whose poor appearance ne'er drew forth her scorn <eos>
alas ‘ tis true , i have gone here and there <eos> and made my self a motley to the view <eos> gored mine own thoughts , sold cheap what is most dear <eos> made old offences of affections new <eos> most true it is , that i have looked on truth <eos> askance and strangely : but by all above <eos> these blenches gave my heart another youth <eos> and worse essays proved thee my best of love <eos> now all is done , have what shall have no end <eos> mine appetite i never more will grind <eos> on newer proof , to try an older friend <eos> a god in love , to whom i am confined <eos> then give me welcome , next my heaven the best <eos> even to thy pure and most most loving breast <eos>
think not alone to do right , and fulfill <eos> life 's due perfection by the simple worth <eos> of lawful actions called by justice forth <eos> and thus condone a world confused with ill <eos> but fix the high condition of thy will <eos> to be right , that its good 's spontaneous birth <eos> may spread like flowers springing from the earth <eos> on which the natural dews of heaven distill <eos> for these require no honors , take no care <eos> for gratitude from men — but more are blessed <eos> in the sweet ignorance that they are fair <eos> and through their proper functions live and rest <eos> breathing their fragrance out with joyous air <eos> content with praise of bettering what is best <eos>
i griev 'd for buonaparte , with a vain <eos> and an unthinking grief ! the vital blood <eos> of that man 's mind what can it be ? what food <eos> fed his first hopes ? what knowledge could he gain <eos> ‘ tis not in battles that from youth we train <eos> the governor who must be wise and good <eos> and temper with the sternness of the brain <eos> thoughts motherly , and meek as womanhood <eos> wisdom doth live with children round her knees <eos> books , leisure , perfect freedom , and the talk <eos> man holds with week day man in the hourly walk <eos> of the mind 's business : these are the degrees <eos> by which true sway doth mount ; this is the stalk <eos> true power doth grow on ; and her rights are these <eos>
yon starry vault that round him rolls the spheres <eos> and gives to earth her seasons , days and years <eos> the source designates and the clue imparts <eos> of all his errors and of all his arts <eos> there spreads the system that his ardent thought <eos> first into emblems , then to spirits wrought <eos> spirits that ruled all matter and all mind <eos> nourish 'd or famish 'd , kill 'd or cured mankind <eos> bade him neglect the soil whereon he fed <eos> work with hard hand for that which was not bread <eos> erect the temple , darken deep the shrine <eos> yield the full hecatomb with awe divine <eos> despise this earth , and claim with lifted eyes <eos> his health and harvest from the meteor 'd skies <eos>
whatever be thy substance , o bright gleam <eos> iron or stone , silver or wind , air cloud <eos> or dream , my longing is the same for thee <eos> within me thought and hands and art and science <eos> struggle to build together the same temple <eos> maternal rhea treasures in her breast <eos> all marbles : purple , green , and white . i searched <eos> and found them in your care , taygetus <eos> snake like , and cyclads fair , and attica <eos> and now the columns stand a forest speechless <eos> and motionless ; and among them , the rhythms <eos> and thoughts move in slow measures constantly <eos> and in their depths , light written images <eos> show love that leads and soul that follows him <eos>
the wild tide of battle runs red ,— dashes high <eos> and blots out the splendour of earth and of sky <eos> the blue air is heavy , and sulph'rous , and dun <eos> and the breeze on its wings bears the boom of the gun <eos> in faster and fiercer and deadlier shocks <eos> the thunderous billows are hurled on the rocks <eos> and our valley becomes , amid spring 's softest breath <eos> the valley , alas ! of the shadow of death <eos> the crash of the onset ,— the plunge and the roll <eos> reach down to the depth of each patriot 's soul <eos> it quivers — for since it is human , it must <eos> but never a tremor of doubt or distrust <eos> once blanches the cheek , or is wrung from the mouth <eos> or lurks in the eye of the sons of the south <eos>
i saw a phoenix in the wood alone <eos> with purple wings and crest of golden hewe <eos> strange bird he was , whereby i thought anone <eos> that of some heavenly wight i had the vewe <eos> untill he came unto the broken tree <eos> and to the spring that late devoured was <eos> what say i more ? each thing at last we see <eos> doth passe away : the phoenix there , alas <eos> spying the tree destroid , the water dride <eos> himselfe smote with his beake , as in disdaine <eos> and so foorthwith in great despight he dide <eos> that yet my heart burnes in exceeding paine <eos> for ruth and pitie of so haples plight <eos> o , let mine eyes no more see such a sight <eos>
from this dread sowing , grant us harvest , lord <eos> of nobler doing , and of loftier hope <eos> an all embracing and enduring peace <eos> a bond of states , a pact of peoples , based <eos> on no caprice of royal whim , but on <eos> foundation mightier than the mightiest throne <eos> the well considered will of all the lands <eos> therewith ,— a simpler , purer , larger life <eos> unhampered by the dread of war 's alarms <eos> a life attuned to closer touch with thee <eos> and golden threaded with thy charity <eos> a sweeter earth ,— a nearer heaven ,— a world <eos> as emulous in peace as once in war <eos> and striving ever upward towards the goal <eos>

who says drum major says a man of mould <eos> shaking the meek earth with tremendous tread <eos> and pacing still , a triumph to behold <eos> of his own spine at least two yards ahead <eos> attorney , grocer , surgeon , broker , duke <eos> his calling may be anything , who comes <eos> into a room , his presence a rebuke <eos> to the dejected , as the pipes and drums <eos> inspired his port !— who mounts his office stairs <eos> as though he led great armies to the fight <eos> his bulk itself 's pure genius , and he wears <eos> his avoirdupois with so much fire and spright <eos> that , though the creature stands but five feet five <eos> you take him for the tallest he alive <eos>
poor rod'rick now no other hope had got <eos> than what the chance of traffick might allot <eos> illusion vain , or doubtful at the best <eos> though some grow rich , yet all are not so blessed <eos> ‘ twas said our husband never would succeed <eos> and truly , such it seemed to be decreed <eos> his agents ( similar to those we see <eos> in modern days ) were with his treasure free <eos> his ships were wrecked ; his commerce came to naught <eos> deceived by knaves , of whom he well had thought <eos> obliged to borrow money , which to pay <eos> he was unable at th ’ appointed day <eos> he fled , and with a farmer shelter took <eos> where he might hope the bailiffs would not look <eos>

now gentle sleep hath closed up those eyes <eos> which , waking , kept my boldest thoughts in awe <eos> and free access unto that sweet lip lies <eos> from which i long the rosy breath to draw <eos> methinks no wrong it were , if i should steal <eos> from those two melting rubies one poor kiss <eos> none sees the theft that would the thief reveal <eos> nor rob i her of aught that she can miss <eos> nay , should i twenty kisses take away <eos> there would be little sign i had done so <eos> why then should i this robbery delay <eos> o , she may wake , and therewith angry grow <eos> well if she do , i 'll back restore that one <eos> and twenty hundred thousand more for loan <eos>
rome ! what a scroll of history thine has been <eos> in the first days thy sword republican <eos> ruled the whole world for many an age 's span <eos> then of the peoples wert thou royal queen <eos> till in thy streets the bearded goth was seen <eos> and now upon thy walls the breezes fan <eos> ( ah , city crowned by god , discrowned by man <eos> the hated flag of red and white and green <eos> when was thy glory ! when in search for power <eos> thine eagles flew to greet the double sun <eos> and the wild nations shuddered at thy rod <eos> nay , but thy glory tarried for this hour <eos> when pilgrims kneel before the holy one <eos> the prisoned shepherd of the church of god <eos>
so long your reign , said richard , o'er my mind <eos> deny i could not , howsoe'er inclined <eos> with mrs. simon often is your spouse <eos> her character no doubt your spleen will rouse <eos> i 've no design , observe to give offence <eos> but , when i see your int'rest in suspense <eos> i cannot silent keep ; though , were i still <eos> a slave , devoted wholly to your will <eos> as late i moved , i would not drop a word <eos> mistrust of lovers may not be absurd <eos> besides , you 'd fancy other motives led <eos> to tell you of your husband what was said <eos> but heav'n be praised , of you i nothing want <eos> my object 's plain — no more the fond gallant <eos>
there is a bondage worse , far worse , to bear <eos> than his who breathes , by roof , and floor , and wall <eos> pent in , a tyrant 's solitary thrall <eos> ‘ tis his who walks about in the open air <eos> one of a nation who , henceforth , must wear <eos> their fetters in their souls . for who could be <eos> who , even the best , in such condition , free <eos> from self reproach , reproach that <eos> with human nature ? never be it ours <eos> to see the sun how brightly it will shine <eos> and know that noble feelings , manly powers <eos> instead of gathering strength , must droop and pine <eos> and earth with all her pleasant fruits and flowers <eos> fade , and participate in man 's decline <eos>
“ oft , when the world imagine women stray <eos> the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way <eos> through all the giddy circle they pursue <eos> and old impertinence expel by new <eos> what tender maid but must a victim fall <eos> to one man 's treat , but for another 's ball <eos> when florio speaks what virgin could withstand <eos> if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand <eos> with varying vanities , from every part <eos> they shift the moving toyshop of their heart <eos> where wigs with wigs , with sword knots sword knots strive <eos> beaux banish beaux , and coaches coaches drive <eos> this erring mortal 's levity may call <eos> oh , blind to truth ! the sylphs contrive it all <eos>
hakon .— ha ! spare thy pity ; as thou seest me here <eos> thou seest the last flash and the latest spark <eos> of ancient northern force and hero 's life <eos> and that , with all thy fever stricken dreams <eos> proud youth , thou shalt be powerless to quench <eos> i well do know it is the christian custom <eos> to pity , to convert , and to amend <eos> our custom is to heartily despise you <eos> to ruminate upon your fall and death <eos> as foes to gods and to a hero 's life <eos> that hakon does , and therein does consist <eos> his villainy . by odin , and by thor <eos> thou shalt not quench old norway 's warlike flame <eos> with all thy misty dreams of piety <eos>
the countess turned her face to the yerl <eos> it was true what was said by the dying girl <eos> it was sir peregrine 's horn they heard <eos> and they both sat mute , nor whispered a word <eos> for they wondered much , and were sore afraid <eos> of mysteries working about the maid <eos> who , as she lay in her ecstasie <eos> kept muttering slow an ave marie <eos> “ oh , lady sweet ! the sign hath come <eos> happy the maid whom her knight calls home <eos> it is the nightingale that i hear <eos> the golden sun is shining clear <eos> and i 've heard tell in time past gone <eos> blessed is the bier that the sun shines on <eos>
this nature , this great flood of life , this cheat <eos> that uses us as baubles for her coat <eos> takes love , that should be nothing but the beat <eos> of blood for its own beauty , by the throat <eos> saying , you are my servant and shall do <eos> my purposes , or utter bitterness <eos> shall be your wage , and nothing come to you <eos> but stammering tongues that never can confess <eos> undaunted then in answer here i cry <eos> ‘ you wanton , that control the hand of him <eos> who masquerades as wisdom in a sky <eos> where holy , holy , sing the cherubim <eos> i will not pay one penny to your name <eos> though all my body crumble into shame <eos>
dark days have passed , but you who taught me then <eos> to look upon the world with trustful eyes <eos> are not forgotten ! quick to sympathise <eos> with noble thoughts , i 've dreamt of moments when <eos> your low voice filled with strains of fairer skies <eos> stray breaths of grecian song that went and came <eos> like floating fragrance from some quiet glen <eos> in those far hills which shine with classic fame <eos> of passioned nymphs and grand browed god like men <eos> i sometimes fear my heart hath lost the same <eos> sweet sense of harmony ; but this i know <eos> that beauty waits on you where'er you go <eos> because she loveth child like faith ! her bowers <eos> are rich for it with glad perennial flowers <eos>
accustom 'd thus to bow the suppliant head <eos> and reverence powers that shake his heart with dread <eos> his pliant faith extends with easy ken <eos> from heavenly hosts to heaven anointed men <eos> the sword , the tripod join their mutual aids <eos> to film his eyes with more impervious shades <eos> create a sceptred idol , and enshrine <eos> the robber chief in attributes divine <eos> arm the new phantom with the nation 's rod <eos> and hail the dreadful delegate of god <eos> two settled slaveries thus the race control <eos> engross their labors and debase their soul <eos> till creeds and crimes and feuds and fears compose <eos> the seeds of war and all its kindred woes <eos>
champlain receives the congregated host <eos> and his husht waves beneath the sails are lost <eos> ticonderoga rears his rocks in vain <eos> nor edward 's walls the weighty shock sustain <eos> deep george 's loaded lake reluctant guides <eos> their bounding barges o'er his sacred tides <eos> state after state the splendid pomp appalls <eos> each town surrenders , every fortress falls <eos> sinclair retires ; and with his feeble train <eos> in slow retreat o'er many a fatal plain <eos> allures their march ; wide moves their furious force <eos> and flaming hamlets mark their wasting course <eos> thro fortless realms their spreading ranks are wheel 'd <eos> on mohawk 's wrestern wave , on bennington 's dread field <eos>
batter my heart , three person 'd god , for you <eos> as yet but knock ; breathe , shine , and seek to mend <eos> that i may rise and stand , o'erthrow me , and bend <eos> your force to break , blow , burn , and make me new <eos> i , like an usurped town , to another due <eos> labour to admit you , but oh ! to no end <eos> reason , your viceroy in me , we should defend <eos> but is captived , and proves weak or untrue <eos> yet dearly i love you , and would be loved fain <eos> but am betrothed unto your enemy <eos> divorce me , untie , or break that knot again <eos> take me to you , imprison me ; for i <eos> except you enthral me , never shall be free <eos> nor ever chaste , except you ravish me <eos>
“ still in the dark abodes of death i stood <eos> when near anticlea moved , and drank the blood <eos> straight all the mother in her soul awakes <eos> and , owning her ulysses , thus she speaks <eos> ‘ comest thou , my son , alive , to realms beneath <eos> the dolesome realms of darkness and of death <eos> comest thou alive from pure , ethereal day <eos> dire is the region , dismal is the way <eos> here lakes profound , there floods oppose their waves <eos> there the wide sea with all his billows raves <eos> or ( since to dust proud troy submits her towers <eos> comest thou a wanderer from the phrygian shores <eos> or say , since honour call 'd thee to the field <eos> hast thou thy ithaca , thy bride , beheld <eos>
why might i not for once be of that sect <eos> which hold that souls , when nature hath her right <eos> some other bodies to themselves elect <eos> and sunlike make the day , and license night <eos> that soul , whose setting in one hemisphere <eos> was to enlighten straight another part <eos> in that horizon , if i see it there <eos> calls for my first respect and its desert <eos> her virtue is the same and may be more <eos> for as the sun is distant , so his power <eos> in operation differs , and the store <eos> of thick clouds interpos 'd make him less our <eos> and verily i think her climate such <eos> since to my former flame it adds so much <eos>
god , through his offspring nature , gave me love <eos> though man in opposition saith me nay <eos> and taketh from my heart its life to day <eos> as through the valley of the world i rove <eos> still unaccompanied , within the grove <eos> that doth enamored beings hold at play <eos> my spirit must pursue its lonely way <eos> and strive to pluck some flowers that bloom above <eos> oh , wherefore then doth nature give desire <eos> to have that which mankind may not possess <eos> and force him to endure on earth hell 's fire <eos> and live in one perpetual distress <eos> some evil power must such love inspire <eos> and with it masquerade in cupid 's dress <eos>
picture his pain , his misery , when first <eos> his growing wants their proud concealment burst <eos> when the first tears start from his stubborn soul <eos> big , burning , solitary drops , that roll <eos> down his pale cheek — the momentary gush <eos> of human weakness — till the whirlwind rush <eos> of pride , of shame , had dashed them from his eye <eos> and his swollen heart heaved mad with agony <eos> then , then the pain — the infinity of feeling <eos> words fail to paint its anguish . reason , reeling <eos> staggered with torture through his burning brain <eos> while his teeth gnashed with bitterness and pain <eos> reflection grew a scorpion , speech had fled <eos> and all but madness and despair were dead <eos>

‘ o miracle of women , ’ said the book <eos> ‘ o noble heart who , being strait besieged <eos> by this wild king to force her to his wish <eos> nor bent , nor broke , nor shunned a soldier 's death <eos> but now when all was lost or seemed as lost <eos> her stature more than mortal in the burst <eos> of sunrise , her arm lifted , eyes on fire <eos> brake with a blast of trumpets from the gate <eos> and , falling on them like a thunderbolt <eos> she trampled some beneath her horses ’ heels <eos> and some were whelmed with missiles of the wall <eos> and some were pushed with lances from the rock <eos> and part were drowned within the whirling brook <eos> o miracle of noble womanhood <eos>
continued john :— now i will thee instruct <eos> the proper manner , matters to conduct <eos> for thee to have a clever mare by day <eos> and still at night a charming wife survey <eos> face , legs , and ev'ry thing shall reappear <eos> come , see it done , and i 'll perform it here <eos> thou'lt then the method fully comprehend <eos> but hold thy tongue , or all will quickly end <eos> a single word the magick would dispel <eos> and , during life , no more with us ‘ twould dwell <eos> keep close thy mouth and merely ope ’ thy eyes <eos> a glimpse alone to learn it will suffice <eos> this o'er , thyself shall practise it the same <eos> and all will follow as when first it came <eos>
the single eye , the daughter of the light <eos> well pleased to recognise in lowliest shade <eos> some glimmer of its parent beam , and made <eos> by daily draughts of brightness , inly bright <eos> the taste severe , yet graceful , trained aright <eos> in classic depth and clearness , and repaid <eos> by thanks and honour from the wise and staid <eos> by pleasant skill to blame , and yet delight <eos> and high communion with the eloquent throng <eos> of those who purified our speech and song <eos> all these are yours . the same examples lure <eos> you in each woodland , me on breezy moor <eos> with kindred aim the same sweet path along <eos> to knit in loving knowledge rich and poor <eos>
what part is left thee , lion ? ravenous beast <eos> which hadst the world for pasture , and for scope <eos> and compass of thine homicidal hope <eos> the kingdom of the spirit of man , the feast <eos> of souls subdued from west to sunless east <eos> from blackening north to bloodred south aslope <eos> all servile ; earth for footcloth of the pope <eos> and heaven for chancel ceiling of the priest <eos> thou that hadst earth by right of rack and rod <eos> thou that hadst rome because thy name was god <eos> and by thy creed 's gift heaven wherein to dwell <eos> heaven laughs with all his light and might above <eos> that earth has cast thee out of faith and love <eos> thy part is but the hollow dream of hell <eos>
jones ! when from calais southward you and i <eos> travell 'd on foot together ; then this way <eos> which i am pacing now , was like the may <eos> with festivals of new born liberty <eos> a homeless sound of joy was in the sky <eos> the antiquated earth , as one might say <eos> beat like the heart of man : songs , garlands , play <eos> banners , and happy faces , far and nigh <eos> and now , sole register that these things were <eos> two solitary greetings have i heard <eos> “ good morrow , citizen ! ” a hollow word <eos> as if a dead man spake it ! yet despair <eos> i feel not : happy am i as a bird <eos> fair seasons yet will come , and hopes as fair <eos>
oh , solitude ! thou wonder working fay <eos> come nurse my feeble fancy in your arms <eos> though i , and thee , and fancy town pent lay <eos> come , call around , a world of country charms <eos> let all this room , these walls dissolve away <eos> and bring me surrey 's fields to take their place <eos> this floor be grass , and draughts as breezes play <eos> yon curtains trees , to wave in summer 's face <eos> my ceiling , sky ; my water jug a stream <eos> my bed , a bank , on which to muse and dream <eos> the spell is wrought : imagination swells <eos> my sleeping room to hills , and woods , and dells <eos> i walk abroad , for naught my footsteps hinder <eos> and fling my arms . oh ! mi ! i 've broke the winder <eos>
i found a torrent falling in a glen <eos> where the sun 's light shone silvered and leaf split <eos> the boom , the foam , and the mad flash of it <eos> all made a magic symphony ; but when <eos> i thought upon the coming of hard men <eos> to cut those patriarchal trees away <eos> and turn to gold the silver of that spray <eos> i shuddered . yet a gladness now and then <eos> did wake me to myself till i was glad <eos> in earnest , and was welcoming the time <eos> for screaming saws to sound above the chime <eos> of idle waters , and for me to know <eos> the jealous visionings that i had had <eos> were steps to the great place where trees and torrents go <eos>
the tree of faith its bare , dry boughs must shed <eos> that nearer heaven the living ones may climb <eos> the false must fail , though from our shores of time <eos> the old lament be heard , “ great pan is dead <eos> that wail is error 's , from his high place hurled <eos> this sharp recoil is evil undertrod <eos> our time 's unrest , an angel sent of god <eos> troubling with life the waters of the world <eos> even as they list the winds of the spirit blow <eos> to turn or break our century rusted vanes <eos> sands shift and waste ; the rock alone remains <eos> where , led of heaven , the strong tides come and go <eos> and storm clouds , rent by thunderbolt and wind <eos> leave , free of mist , the permanent stars behind <eos>
slow toiling upward from ’ the misty vale <eos> i leave the bright enamelled zones below <eos> no more for me their beauteous bloom shall glow <eos> their lingering sweetness load the morning gale <eos> few are the slender flowerets , scentless , pale <eos> that on their ice clad stems all trembling blow <eos> along the margin of unmelting snow <eos> yet with unsaddened voice thy verge i hail <eos> white realm of peace above the flowering line <eos> welcome thy frozen domes , thy rocky spires <eos> o'er thee undimmed the moon girt planets shine <eos> on thy majestic altars fade the fires <eos> that filled the air with smoke of vain desires <eos> and all the unclouded blue of heaven is thine <eos>
star sirius and the pole star dwell afar <eos> beyond the drawings each of other 's strength <eos> one blazes through the brief bright summer 's length <eos> lavishing life heat from a flaming car <eos> while one unchangeable upon a throne <eos> broods o'er the frozen heart of earth alone <eos> content to reign the bright particular star <eos> of some who wander or of some who groan <eos> they own no drawings each of other 's strength <eos> nor vibrate in a visible sympathy <eos> nor veer along their courses each toward each <eos> yet are their orbits pitched in harmony <eos> of one dear heaven , across whose depth and length <eos> mayhap they talk together without speech <eos>
here on the monarch ’ s speech achilles broke <eos> and furious , thus , and interrupting spoke <eos> “ tyrant , i well deserved thy galling chain <eos> to live thy slave , and still to serve in vain <eos> should i submit to each unjust decree <eos> command thy vassals , but command not me <eos> seize on briseis , whom the grecians doom ’ d <eos> my prize of war , yet tamely see resumed <eos> and seize secure ; no more achilles draws <eos> his conquering sword in any woman ’ s cause <eos> the gods command me to forgive the past <eos> but let this first invasion be the last <eos> for know , thy blood , when next thou darest invade <eos> shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade <eos>
green little vaulter in the sunny grass <eos> catching your heart up at the feel of june <eos> sole voice that 's heard amidst the lazy noon <eos> when even the bees lag at the summoning brass <eos> and you , warm little housekeeper , who class <eos> with those who think the candles come too soon <eos> loving the fire , and with your tricksome tune <eos> nick the glad silent moments as they pass <eos> o sweet and tiny cousins , that belong <eos> one to the fields , the other to the hearth <eos> both have your sunshine ; both , though small , are strong <eos> at your clear hearts ; and both seem given to earth <eos> to sing in thoughtful ears their natural song <eos> in doors and out , summer and winter , mirth <eos>
i never thought then little kitty malone <eos> as heir to old gripus would bring him the cash <eos> ‘ pon which as a banker jack merdle has shone <eos> and kitty in fashion has cut such a dash <eos> nor when as a girl not a shoe to her feet <eos> she accepted my offers of coppers or candy <eos> she would tell me in satin “ we 've nothing to eat <eos> while eating from silver or sipping her brandy <eos> and wond'ring that merdle , the jack i have named <eos> should bring home a friend — ( ‘ twas thus she exclaimed <eos> the day that i 've mentioned — a day to remember <eos> when merdle and i in his carriage and bays <eos> through avenue five on a day in september <eos> drove up to a mansion with gas light ablaze <eos>
i mark , as april days serenely smile <eos> clouds heaped on clouds in mountain like array <eos> while radiant sunbeams with their summits play <eos> gilding with gorgeous tints the mighty pile <eos> and earth partakes of every hue the while <eos> oft have i felt on such a day as this <eos> the sudden shower down pouring on my head <eos> though in the distance all is loveliness <eos> thither , in vain , with rapid step i 've sped <eos> i liken this to hope : although with sorrow <eos> the heart is overcast , and dim the eye <eos> delusive hope — not present , ever nigh <eos> presages gladness on a coming morrow <eos> and lures us onward , till our latest sigh <eos>
howe'er this fair , amid adventures dire <eos> more sufferings shared than malice could desire <eos> though eight times , doubtless , she exchanged her knight <eos> no proof , that she her spouse was led to slight <eos> ‘ twas gratitude , compassion , or good will <eos> the dread of worse ;— she 'd truly had her fill <eos> excuses just , to vindicate her fame <eos> who , spite of troubles , fanned the monarch 's flame <eos> of eight the relict , still a maid received <eos> apparently , the prince her pure believed <eos> for , though at times we may be duped in this <eos> yet , after such a number — strange to miss <eos> and i submit to those who 've passed the scene <eos> if they , to my opinion , do not lean <eos>
no song nor dance i bring from yon great city <eos> that queens it o'er our taste — the more 's the pity <eos> tho ’ , by the by , abroad why will you roam <eos> good sense and taste are natives here at home <eos> but not for panegyric i appear <eos> i come to wish you all a good new year <eos> old father time deputes me here before ye <eos> not for to preach , but tell his simple story <eos> the sage grave ancient cough 'd , and bade me say <eos> “ you 're one year older this important day <eos> if wiser too — he hinted some suggestion <eos> but ‘ twould be rude , you know , to ask the question <eos> and with a would be roguish leer and wink <eos> he bade me on you press this one word — “ think <eos>
on tidings of the wreck of vrishni 's race <eos> king yudhi sthira of the pandavas <eos> was minded to be done with earthly things <eos> and to arjuna spake : “ o noble prince <eos> time endeth all ; we linger , noose on neck <eos> till the last day tightens the line , and kills <eos> let us go forth to die , being yet alive <eos> and kunti 's son , the great arjuna , said <eos> “ let us go forth ! time slayeth all <eos> we will find death , who seeketh other men <eos> and bhimasena , hearing , answered : “ yea <eos> we will find death ! ” and sahadev cried : “ yea <eos> and his twin brother nakalu ; whereat <eos> the princes set their faces for the mount <eos>
in drunkenness what pow ’ rful magic lies <eos> what ’ s most envelop ’ d from researching eyes <eos> ( transparent thing !) it evidently shows <eos> the innocent no dark disguises knows <eos> by her commands our hopes maturely rise <eos> push ’ d on to war the coward dauntless dies <eos> and sinking minds beneath unwieldy care <eos> cast off the load , and move with sprightful air <eos> to her , all arts their origin must owe <eos> what wretch so dull but eloquent must grow <eos> when the full goblets with persuasive wine <eos> inebriate with bright elegance divine <eos> the drunken beggars plume like proudest kings <eos> and the poor tipsy slave in fetters sings <eos>
the weary mariner so fast not flies <eos> a howling tempest , harbour to attain <eos> nor shepherd hastes , when frays of wolves arise <eos> so fast to fold , to save his bleating train <eos> as i , wing 'd with contempt and just disdain <eos> now fly the world , and what it most doth prize <eos> and sanctuary seek , free to remain <eos> from wounds of abject times , and envy 's eyes <eos> to me this world did once seem sweet and fair <eos> while senses ’ light mind 's prospective kept blind <eos> now , like imagined landscape in the air <eos> and weeping rainbows , her best joys i find <eos> or if aught here is had that praise should have <eos> it is a life obscure , and silent grave <eos>
if thou hadst been a sculptor , what a race <eos> of forms divine had ever preached to men <eos> lo , i behold thy brow , all glorious then <eos> ( its reflex dawning on the statue 's face <eos> bringing its thought to birth in human grace <eos> the soul of the grand form , upstarting , when <eos> thou openest thus thy mysteries to our ken <eos> striking a marble window through blind space <eos> but god , who mouldeth in life plastic clay <eos> flashing his thoughts from men with living eyes <eos> not from still marble forms , changeless alway <eos> breathed forth his human self in human guise <eos> thou didst appear , walking unknown abroad <eos> the son of man , the human , subject god <eos>
thine eyes ’ blue tenderness , thy long fair hair <eos> and the warm lustre of thy features — caught <eos> from contemplation — where serenely wrought <eos> seems sorrow 's softness charmed from its despair <eos> have thrown such speaking sadness in thine air <eos> that — but i know thy blessed bosom fraught <eos> with mines of unalloyed and stainless thought <eos> i should have deemed thee doomed to earthly care <eos> with such an aspect , by his colours blent <eos> when from his beauty breathing pencil born <eos> ( except that thou hast nothing to repent <eos> the magdalen of guido saw the morn <eos> such seem'st thou — but how much more excellent <eos> with nought remorse can claim — nor virtue scorn <eos>

o from what power hast thou this powerful might <eos> with insufficiency my heart to sway <eos> to make me give the lie to my true sight <eos> and swear that brightness doth not grace the day <eos> whence hast thou this becoming of things ill <eos> that in the very refuse of thy deeds <eos> there is such strength and warrantise of skill <eos> that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds <eos> who taught thee how to make me love thee more <eos> the more i hear and see just cause of hate <eos> o though i love what others do abhor <eos> with others thou shouldst not abhor my state <eos> if thy unworthiness raised love in me <eos> more worthy i to be beloved of thee <eos>
lady , to death we 're doom 'd , our crime the same <eos> thou , that in me thou kindled'st such fierce heat <eos> i , that my heart did of a sun so sweet <eos> the rays concentre to so hot a flame <eos> i , fascinated by an adder 's eye <eos> deaf as an adder thou to all my pain <eos> thou obstinate in scorn , in passion i <eos> i lov 'd too much , too much didst thou disdain <eos> hear then our doom in hell as just as stern <eos> our sentence equal as our crimes conspire <eos> who living bask 'd at beauty 's earthly fire <eos> in living flames eternal these must burn <eos> hell for us both fit places too supplies <eos> in my heart thou wilt burn , i roast before thine eyes <eos>
yet ah ! whence comes this visionary scene <eos> ‘ t is fancy 's wild a ë rial dream i ween <eos> by her inspired , when reason takes its flight <eos> what fond illusions beam upon the sight <eos> she waves her hand , and lo ! what forms appear <eos> what magic sounds salute the wondering ear <eos> once more o'er distant regions do we tread <eos> and the cold grave yields up its cherish 'd dead <eos> while , present sorrows banish 'd far away <eos> unclouded azure gilds the placid day <eos> or , in the future 's cloud encircled face <eos> fair scenes of bliss to come we fondly trace <eos> and draw minutely every little wile <eos> which shall the feathery hours of time beguile <eos>
how sweet it is , when mother fancy rocks <eos> the wayward brain , to saunter through a wood <eos> an old place , full of many a lovely brood <eos> tall trees , green arbours , and ground flowers in flocks <eos> and wild rose tip toe upon hawthorn stocks <eos> like to a bonny lass , who plays her pranks <eos> at wakes and fairs with wandering mountebanks <eos> when she stands cresting the clown 's head , and mocks <eos> the crowd beneath her . verily i think <eos> such place to me is sometimes like a dream <eos> or map of the whole world : thoughts , link by link <eos> enter through ears and eyesight , with such gleam <eos> of all things , that at last in fear i shrink <eos> and leap at once from the delicious stream <eos>
only until this cigarette is ended <eos> a little moment at the end of all <eos> while on the floor the quiet ashes fall <eos> and in the firelight to a lance extended <eos> bizarrely with the jazzing music blended <eos> the broken shadow dances on the wall <eos> i will permit my memory to recall <eos> the vision of you , by all my dreams attended <eos> and then adieu ,— farewell !— the dream is done <eos> yours is a face of which i can forget <eos> the color and the features , every one <eos> the words not ever , and the smiles not yet <eos> but in your day this moment is the sun <eos> upon a hill , after the sun has set <eos>
when i consider how my light is spent <eos> ere half my days , in this dark world and wide <eos> and that one talent which is death to hide <eos> lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent <eos> to serve therewith my maker , and present <eos> my true account , lest he returning chide <eos> “ doth god exact day labour , light denied <eos> i fondly ask . but patience , to prevent <eos> that murmur , soon replies , “ god doth not need <eos> either man 's work , or his own gifts . who best <eos> bear his mild yoke , they serve him best : his state <eos> is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed <eos> and post o'er land and ocean without rest <eos> they also serve who only stand and wait <eos>
therefore your halls , your ancient colleges <eos> your portals statued with old kings and queens <eos> your bridges and your busted libraries <eos> wax lighted chapels and rich carved screens <eos> your doctors and your proctors and your deans <eos> shall not avail you when the day beam sports <eos> new risen o'er awakened albion — no <eos> nor yet your solemn organ pipes that blow <eos> melodious thunders through your vacant courts <eos> at morn and even ; for your manner sorts <eos> not with this age , nor with the thoughts that roll <eos> because the words of little children preach <eos> against you ,— ye that did profess to teach <eos> and have taught nothing , feeding on the soul <eos>
but earth is now thy living picture , where <eos> thou shadowest truth , the simple and profound <eos> by the same form in vital union bound <eos> where one can see but the first step of thy stair <eos> another sees it vanish far in air <eos> when thy king david viewed the starry round <eos> from heart and fingers broke the psaltery sound <eos> lord , what is man , that thou shouldst mind his prayer <eos> but when the child beholds the heavens on high <eos> he babbles childish noises — not less dear <eos> than what the king sang praying — to the ear <eos> of him who made the child and king and sky <eos> earth is thy picture , painter great , whose eye <eos> sees with the child , sees with the kingly seer <eos>
“ thou noblest monument of albion 's isle <eos> whether , by merlin 's aid , from scythia 's shore <eos> to amber 's fatal plain pendragon bore <eos> huge frame of giant hands , the mighty pile <eos> t'entomb his britons slain by hengist 's guile <eos> or druid priests , sprinkled with human gore <eos> taught mid thy massy maze their mystic lore <eos> or danish chiefs , enrich 'd with savage spoil <eos> to victory 's idol vast , an unhewn shrine <eos> rear 'd the rude heap , or in thy hallow 'd ground <eos> repose the kings of brutus ’ genuine line <eos> or here those kings in solemn state were crown 'd <eos> studious to trace thy wondrous origin <eos> we muse on many an ancient tale renown 'd <eos>
the patriarch look 'd ; and every frontier height <eos> pours down the swarthy nations to the fight <eos> where kennebec 's high source forsakes the sky <eos> where long champlain 's yet unkeel 'd waters lie <eos> where hudson crowds his hill dissundering tide <eos> where kaatskill dares the starry vault divide <eos> where the dim alleganies sit sublime <eos> and give their streams to every neighboring clime <eos> the swarms descended like an evening shade <eos> and wolves and vultures follow 'd where they spread <eos> thus when a storm , on eastern pinions driven <eos> meets the firm andes in the midst of heaven <eos> the clouds convulse , the torrents pour amain <eos> and the black waters sweep the subject plain <eos>
fairest , when by the rules of palmistry <eos> you took my hand to try if you could guess <eos> by lines therein if any wight there be <eos> ordain 'd to make me know some happiness <eos> i wish 'd that those characters could explain <eos> whom i will never wrong with hope to win <eos> or that by them a copy might be ta'en <eos> by you alone what thoughts i have within <eos> but since the hand of nature did not set <eos> ( as providently loath to have it known <eos> the means to find that hidden alphabet <eos> mine eyes shall be th ’ interpreters alone <eos> by them conceive my thoughts , and tell me , fair <eos> if now you see her that doth love me there <eos>
in vain do earthly princes then , in vain <eos> seek with pyramids to heaven aspir 'd <eos> or huge collosses , built with costly pain <eos> or brazen pillars never to be fir 'd <eos> or shrines , made of the metal most desir 'd <eos> to make their memories for ever live <eos> for how can mortal immortality give <eos> for deeds do die , however nobly done <eos> and thoughts of men do in themselves decay <eos> but wise words taught in numbers for to run <eos> recorded by the muses , live for aye <eos> ne may with storming showers be wash 'd away <eos> ne bitter breathing with harmful blast <eos> nor age , nor envy , shall them ever wast <eos>
great things were ne'er begotten in an hour <eos> ephemerons in birth , are such in life <eos> and he who dareth , in the noble strife <eos> of intellects , to cope for real power <eos> such as god giveth as his rarest dower <eos> of mastery , to the few with greatness rife <eos> must , ere the morning mists have ceased to lower <eos> till the long shadows of the night arrive <eos> stand in the arena . laurels that are won <eos> plucked from green boughs , soon wither ; those that last <eos> are gather 'd patiently , when sultry noon <eos> and summer 's fiery glare in vain are past <eos> life is the hour of labour ; on earth 's breast <eos> serene and undisturb 'd shall be thy rest <eos>
if i was drawn here from a distant place <eos> ‘ twas not to pray nor hear our friend 's address <eos> but , gazing once more on your winsome face <eos> to worship there ideal loveliness <eos> on that pure shrine that has too long ignored <eos> the gifts that once i brought so frequently <eos> i lay this votive offering , to record <eos> how sweet your quiet beauty seemed to me <eos> enchanting girl , my faith is not a thing <eos> by futile prayers and vapid psalm singing <eos> to vent in crowded nave and public pew <eos> my creed is simple : that the world is fair <eos> and beauty the best thing to worship there <eos> and i confess it by adoring you <eos>
yet not in vain , o river of yesterday <eos> through chasms of darkness to the deep descending <eos> i heard thee sobbing in the rain , and blending <eos> thy voice with other voices far away <eos> i called to thee , and yet thou wouldst not stay <eos> but turbulent , and with thyself contending <eos> and torrent like thy force on pebbles spending <eos> thou wouldst not listen to a poet 's lay <eos> thoughts , like a loud and sudden rush of wings <eos> regrets and recollections of things past <eos> with hints and prophecies of things to be <eos> and inspirations , which , could they be things <eos> and stay with us , and we could hold them fast <eos> were our good angels ,— these i owe to thee <eos>
robert of sicily , brother of pope urbane <eos> and valmond , emperor of allemaine <eos> despoiled of his magnificent attire <eos> bare headed , breathless , and besprent with mire <eos> with sense of wrong and outrage desperate <eos> strode on and thundered at the palace gate <eos> rushed through the court yard , thrusting in his rage <eos> to right and left each seneschal and page <eos> and hurried up the broad and sounding stair <eos> his white face ghastly in the torches ’ glare <eos> from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed <eos> voices and cries he heard , but did not heed <eos> until at last he reached the banquet room <eos> blazing with light , and breathing with perfume <eos>
what hast thou done ? hark , till thine ears wax hot <eos> judas ; for these and these things hast thou done <eos> thou hast made earth faint , and sickened the sweet sun <eos> with fume of blood that reeks from limbs that rot <eos> thou hast washed thine hands and mouth , saying , “ am i not <eos> clean ? ” and thy lips were bloody , and there was none <eos> to speak for man against thee , no , not one <eos> this hast thou done to us , iscariot <eos> therefore , though thou be deaf and heaven be dumb <eos> a cry shall be from under to proclaim <eos> in the ears of all who shed men 's blood or sell <eos> pius the ninth , judas the second , come <eos> where boniface out of the filth and flame <eos> barks for his advent in the clefts of hell .

lift not the painted veil which those who live <eos> call life : though unreal shapes be pictured there <eos> and it but mimic all we would believe <eos> with colours idly spread ,— behind , lurk fear <eos> and hope , twin destinies ; who ever weave <eos> their shadows , o'er the chasm , sightless and drear <eos> i knew one who had lifted it — he sought <eos> for his lost heart was tender , things to love <eos> but found them not , alas ! nor was there aught <eos> the world contains , the which he could approve <eos> through the unheeding many he did move <eos> a splendour among shadows , a bright blot <eos> upon this gloomy scene , a spirit that strove <eos> for truth , and like the preacher found it not <eos>
streets and the solitude of country places <eos> were once his friends . but as a man born blind <eos> opening his eyes from lovely dreams , might find <eos> the world a desert and men 's larval faces <eos> so hateful , he would wish to seek again <eos> the darkness and his old chimeric sight <eos> of beauties inward — so , that fresh delight <eos> vision of bright fields and angelic men <eos> that love which made him all the world , is gone <eos> hating and hated now , he stands alone <eos> an island point , measureless gulfs apart <eos> from other lives , from the old happiness <eos> of being more than self , when heart to heart <eos> gave all , yet grew the greater , not the less <eos>
my heart is tuned to sorrow , and the strings <eos> vibrate most readily to minor chords <eos> searching and sad ; my mind is stuffed with words <eos> which voice the passion and the ache of things <eos> illusions beating with their baffled wings <eos> against the walls of circumstance , and hoards <eos> of torn desires , broken joys ; records <eos> of all a bruised life 's maimed imaginings <eos> now you are come ! you tremble like a star <eos> poised where , behind earth 's rim , the sun has set <eos> your voice has sung across my heart , but numb <eos> and mute , i have no tones to answer . far <eos> within i kneel before you , speechless yet <eos> and life ablaze with beauty , i am dumb <eos>
he waits all day beside his little flock <eos> and asks the passing stranger what 's o'clock <eos> but those who often pass his daily tasks <eos> look at their watch and tell before he asks <eos> he mutters stories to himself and lies <eos> where the thick hedge the warmest house supplies <eos> and when he hears the hunters far and wide <eos> he climbs the highest tree to see them ride <eos> he climbs till all the fields are blea and bare <eos> and makes the old crow 's nest an easy chair <eos> and soon his sheep are got in other grounds <eos> he hastens down and fears his master come <eos> he stops the gap and keeps them all in bounds <eos> and tends them closely till it 's time for home <eos>
“ yes ! smiling flora drives her armed car <eos> through the thick ranks of vegetable war <eos> herb , shrub , and tree , with strong emotions rise <eos> for light and air , and battle in the skies <eos> whose roots diverging with opposing toil <eos> contend below for moisture and for soil <eos> round the tall elm the flattering ivies bend <eos> and strangle , as they clasp , their struggling friend <eos> envenom 'd dews from mancinella flow <eos> and scald with caustic touch the tribes below <eos> dense shadowy leaves on stems aspiring borne <eos> with blight and mildew thin the realms of corn <eos> and insect hordes with restless tooth devour <eos> the unfolded bud , and pierce the ravell 'd flower <eos>
a gallant bark was gliding o'er the seas <eos> and , like a living mass , before the breeze <eos> swept on majestic , as a thing of mind <eos> whose spirit held communion with the wind <eos> rearing and rising o'er the billowed tide <eos> as a proud steed doth toss its head in pride <eos> upon its deck young edmund silent stood <eos> a son of sadness ; and his mournful mood <eos> grew day by day , while wave on wave rolled by <eos> and he their homeward current with a sigh <eos> followed with fondness . still the vessel bore <eos> the wanderer onward from his native shore <eos> till in a distant land he lonely stood <eos> ‘ midst city crowds in more than solitude <eos>

like to a little child , whose straying feet <eos> tracking the fox fire 's guiling glint and gleam <eos> have wandered far afield by marsh and stream <eos> while just before the wavering glimmers fleet <eos> on and still on where sky and meadow meet <eos> till , spent and fearful in the gathering gloom <eos> at last he sees the guiding light of home <eos> where love awaits and mother kisses sweet <eos> so was it mine through fens of doubt to stray <eos> pursuing still some fair ephemeron <eos> or fleeting gleam , or shimmering fallacy <eos> till through the deepening dusk a beacon shone <eos> set by the hand of love to light the way <eos> o father , to implicit trust in thee <eos>

the rafters creak ; an empty cupboard door <eos> swings open ; now a wild plank of the floor <eos> breaks from its joist , and leaps behind my foot <eos> down from the chimney half a pound of soot <eos> tumbles , and lies , and shakes itself again <eos> the putty cracks against the window pane <eos> a piece of paper in the basket shoves <eos> another piece , and toward the bottom moves <eos> my independent pencil , while i write <eos> breaks at the point : the ruminating clock <eos> stirs all its body and begins to rock <eos> warning the waiting presence of the night <eos> strikes the dead hour , and tumbles to the plain <eos> ticking of ordinary work again <eos>

this doctrine has the sanction of assent <eos> from nature 's universal parliament <eos> the voice of nations , and the course of things <eos> allow that laws superior are to kings <eos> none but delinquents would have justice cease <eos> knaves rail at laws , as soldiers rail at peace <eos> for justice is the end of government <eos> as reason is the test of argument <eos> no man was ever yet so void of sense <eos> as to debate the right of self defence <eos> a principle so grafted in the mind <eos> with nature born , and does like nature bind <eos> twisted with reason , and with nature too <eos> as neither one nor t'other can undo <eos>
london unfurls its incense coloured dusk <eos> before the panes , rich but a while ago <eos> with the charred gold and the red ember glow <eos> of dying sunset . houses quit the husk <eos> of secrecy , which , through the day , returns <eos> a blank to all enquiry : but at nights <eos> the cheerfulness of fire and lamp invites <eos> the darkness inward , curious of what burns <eos> with such a coloured life when all is dead <eos> the daylight world outside , with overhead <eos> white clouds , and where we walk , the blaze <eos> of wet and sunlit streets , shops and the stream <eos> of glittering traffic — all that the nights erase <eos> colour and speed , surviving but in dream <eos>
awake , o gratitude ! nor let the tears <eos> of selfish sorrow smother up thy voice <eos> when it should speak of a departed friend <eos> a tender friend , the first i ever lost <eos> for destiny till now was merciful <eos> and though i oft have felt a transient pang <eos> for worth unknown , and wept awhile for those <eos> whom long acquaintance only made me love <eos> no keen regret laid pining at my heart <eos> nor memory in the solitary hour <eos> would sting with grief , as when she speaks <eos> thy virtue , knowledge , wisdom , gentleness <eos> thy venerable age , and says that i <eos> had once the happiness to call thee friend <eos>
“ dear brother , dearest friend , when i am dead <eos> and you shall see no more this face of mine <eos> let nothing but red roses be the sign <eos> of the white life i lost for him , ” she said <eos> “ no , do not curse him , — pity him instead <eos> forgive him ! — forgive me ! . . god 's anodyne <eos> for human hate is pity ; and the wine <eos> that makes men wise , forgiveness . i have read <eos> love 's message in love 's murder , and i die <eos> and so they laid her just where she would lie <eos> under red roses . red they bloomed and fell <eos> but when flushed autumn and the snows went by <eos> and spring came , — lo , from every bud 's green shell <eos> burst a white blossom . — can love reason why <eos>
then thronging came the danaans , when they saw <eos> low laid in dust the hero ; but ere then <eos> none dared draw nigh him , but in deadly fear <eos> they watched him from afar . now hasted they <eos> and flung themselves upon the dead , outstretched <eos> upon their faces : on their heads they cast <eos> dust , and their wailing went up to the sky <eos> as when men drive away the tender lambs <eos> out of the fleecy flock , to feast thereon <eos> and round the desolate pens the mothers leap <eos> ceaselessly bleating , so o'er aias rang <eos> that day a very great and bitter cry <eos> wild echoes pealed from ida forest palled <eos> and from the plain , the ships , the boundless sea <eos>
the church bells tolled , the chant of monks drew near <eos> loud trumpets stammered forth their notes of fear <eos> a line of torches smoked along the street <eos> there was a stir , a rush , a tramp of feet <eos> and , with its banners floating in the air <eos> slowly the long procession crossed the square <eos> and , to the statues of the prophets bound <eos> the victims stood , with fagots piled around <eos> then all the air a blast of trumpets shook <eos> and louder sang the monks with bell and book <eos> and the hidalgo , lofty , stern , and proud <eos> lifted his torch , and , bursting through the crowd <eos> lighted in haste the fagots , and then fled <eos> lest those imploring eyes should strike him dead <eos>
so from the sluices of ulysses ’ eyes <eos> fast fell the tears , and sighs succeeded sighs <eos> conceal 'd he grieved : the king observed alone <eos> the silent tear , and heard the secret groan <eos> then to the bard aloud : “ o cease to sing <eos> dumb be thy voice , and mute the tuneful string <eos> to every note his tears responsive flow <eos> and his great heart heaves with tumultuous woe <eos> thy lay too deeply moves : then cease the lay <eos> and o'er the banquet every heart be gay <eos> this social right demands : for him the sails <eos> floating in air , invite the impelling gales <eos> his are the gifts of love : the wise and good <eos> receive the stranger as a brother 's blood <eos>

there 's not in heaven itself a lovelier sight <eos> nor one which angels view with more delight <eos> than youthful soldiers of immanuel 's cross <eos> in life 's glad morning counting all as loss <eos> since they have proved a dying saviour 's love <eos> and placed their treasures and their hearts above <eos> let pleasure woo them with her syren voice <eos> they heed her not — they 've made a nobler choice <eos> let others walk the shining path of fame <eos> they dare to suffer poverty and shame <eos> and turning from the world 's enchanted bowers <eos> to consecrate their youth and all their powers <eos> to him they serve , and even here they find <eos> more real pleasure than they e'er resigned <eos>
still in the trace of one perplex è d thought <eos> my ceaseless cares continually run on <eos> seeking in vain what i have ever sought <eos> one in my love , and her hard heart still one <eos> i who did never joy in other sun <eos> and have no stars but those that must fulfil <eos> the work of rigour , fatally begun <eos> upon this heart whom cruelty will kill <eos> injurious delia !— yet , i love thee still <eos> and will whilst i shall draw this breath of mine <eos> i 'll tell the world that i deserved but ill <eos> and blame myself , t'excuse that heart of thine <eos> see then who sins the greater of us twain <eos> i in my love , or thou in thy disdain <eos>

these flowers awoke in beauty and delight <eos> at early dawn , when stars began to set <eos> at eve they leave us but a fond regret <eos> locked in the cold embraces of the night <eos> these shades that shame the rainbow 's arch of light <eos> where gold and snow in purple pomp are met <eos> all give a warning man should not forget <eos> when one brief day can darken things so bright <eos> ‘ tis but to wither that the roses bloom <eos> ‘ tis to grow old they bear their beauteous flowers <eos> one crimson bud their cradle and their tomb <eos> such are man 's fortunes in this world of ours <eos> they live , they die ; one day doth end their doom <eos> for ages past but seem to us like hours <eos>

joy like a stream flows through the christmas streets <eos> but i am sitting in my silent room <eos> sitting all silent in congenial gloom <eos> to night , while half the world the other greets <eos> with smiles and grasping hands and drinks and meats <eos> i sit and muse on my poetic doom <eos> like the dim scent within a budded rose <eos> a joy is folded in my heart ; and when <eos> i think on poets nurtured ‘ mong the throes <eos> and by the lowly hearths of common men <eos> think of their works , some song , some swelling ode <eos> with gorgeous music growing to a close <eos> deep muffled as the dead march of a god <eos> my heart is burning to be one of those <eos>
heap upon heap the pallid victims lay <eos> of racking pain and scorching thirst the prey <eos> in anguish rolled upon the bloody ground <eos> and wider still they tore each gaping wound <eos> in concert joined their agonizing cries <eos> gnashed with their teeth and rolled their blood shot eyes <eos> with feeble groans they drew each painful breath <eos> and racked with torments called aloud for death <eos> far o'er the field in wild confusion rose <eos> piles of the ghastly dead — of friends and foes <eos> in death stretched side by side , mangled and cold <eos> while over all the sulphurous war clouds rolled <eos> in dark , dense columns mounted up on high <eos> tainting the air , polluting all the sky <eos>

and after further compliment and talk <eos> among the dahlias in the garden walk <eos> he left his guests ; and to his cottage turned <eos> and as he entered for a moment yearned <eos> for the lost splendors of the days of old <eos> the ruby glass , the silver and the gold <eos> and felt how piercing is the sting of pride <eos> by want embittered and intensified <eos> he looked about him for some means or way <eos> to keep this unexpected holiday <eos> searched every cupboard , and then searched again <eos> summoned the maid , who came , but came in vain <eos> “ the signor did not hunt to day , ” she said <eos> “ there 's nothing in the house but wine and bread <eos>
to whom achilles thus with stern regard <eos> “ old man , incense me not ; i mean myself <eos> to give thee back thy son ; for here of late <eos> despatch 'd by jove , my goddess mother came <eos> the daughter of the aged ocean god <eos> and thee too , priam , well i know , some god <eos> ( i cannot err ) hath guided to our ships <eos> no mortal , though in vent'rous youth , would dare <eos> our camp to enter ; nor could hope to pass <eos> unnotic 'd by the watch , nor easily <eos> remove the pond'rous bar that guards our doors <eos> but stir not up my anger in my grief <eos> lest , suppliant though thou be , within my tent <eos> i brook thee not , and jove 's command transgress <eos>

to scenes of noble daring still he turned <eos> his ardent spirit — for he knew not fear <eos> still he led on his legions — and now came <eos> to a strange place , where countless numbers met <eos> his wondering view — countless inhabitants <eos> crowding the city streets , and neighbouring plains <eos> and in the distance presently he saw <eos> a lofty mountain reaching to the stars <eos> onward proceeding , at its foot he found <eos> a guardian dragon , terrible in form <eos> ready with open jaws to crush his victim <eos> but unappalled , sikander him beholding <eos> with steady eye , which scorned to turn aside <eos> sprang forward , and at once the monster slew <eos>

the sea was sapphire coloured , and the sky <eos> burned like a heated opal through the air <eos> we hoisted sail ; the wind was blowing fair <eos> for the blue lands that to the eastward lie <eos> from the steep prow i marked with quickening eye <eos> zakynthos , every olive grove and creek <eos> ithaca 's cliff , lycaon 's snowy peak <eos> and all the flower strewn hills of arcady <eos> the flapping of the sail against the mast <eos> the ripple of the water on the side <eos> the ripple of girls ’ laughter at the stern <eos> the only sounds : when ‘ gan the west to burn <eos> and a red sun upon the seas to ride <eos> i stood upon the soil of greece at last <eos>

yet in the darksome crypt i left so late <eos> whose only altar is its rusted grate <eos> sepulchral , rayless , joyless as it seems <eos> shamed by the glare of may 's refulgent beams <eos> while the dim seasons dragged their shrouded train <eos> its paler splendors were not quite in vain <eos> from these dull bars the cheerful firelight 's glow <eos> streamed through the casement o'er the spectral snow <eos> here , while the night wind wreaked its frantic will <eos> on the loose ocean and the rock bound hill <eos> rent the cracked topsail from its quivering yard <eos> and rived the oak a thousand storms had scarred <eos> fenced by these walls the peaceful taper shone <eos> nor felt a breath to slant its trembling cone <eos>
fair is my love , and cruel as she 's fair <eos> her brow shades frown , although her eyes are sunny <eos> her smiles are lightning , though her pride despair <eos> and her disdains are gall , her favours honey <eos> a modest maid , deck 'd with a blush of honour <eos> whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love <eos> the wonder of all eyes that look upon her <eos> sacred on earth ; design 'd a saint above <eos> chastity and beauty , which are deadly foes <eos> live reconciled friends within her brow <eos> and had she pity to conjoin with those <eos> then who had heard the plaints i utter now <eos> for had she not been fair , and thus unkind <eos> my muse had slept , and none had known my mind <eos>
iv . thou sawest beauty in the streaking cloud <eos> when grief lift up those eyelids ; nor in scorn <eos> broke ever on thine eyes the purple morn <eos> along the cedar tops ; to thee aloud <eos> spake the night solitude , when hushed and bowed <eos> the earth lay at thy feet stony and worn <eos> loving thou markedst when the lamb unshorn <eos> was glad before thee , and amongst the crowd <eos> famished and pent in cities did thine eye <eos> read strangest glory — though in human art <eos> no record lives to tell us that thy heart <eos> bowed to its own deep beauty : deeper did lie <eos> the burden of thy mission , even whereby <eos> we know that beauty liveth where thou art <eos>
in vain to deserts thy retreat is made <eos> the muse attends thee to the silent shade <eos> ‘ tis hers , the brave man 's latest steps to trace <eos> re judge his acts , and dignify disgrace <eos> when interest calls off all her sneaking train <eos> when all the obliged desert , and all the vain <eos> she waits ; or , to the scaffold , or the cell <eos> when the last lingering friend has bid farewell <eos> even now she shades thy evening walk with bays <eos> ( no hireling she , no prostitute to praise <eos> even now , observant of the parting ray <eos> eyes the calm sunset of thy various day <eos> through fortune 's cloud one truly great can see <eos> nor fears to tell that mortimer is he <eos>
bright windy sunshine and the shadow of cloud <eos> quicken the heavy summer to new birth <eos> of life and motion on the drowsing earth <eos> the huge elms stir , till all the air is loud <eos> with their awakening from the muffled sleep <eos> of long hot days . and on the wavering line <eos> that marks the alternate ebb of shade and shine <eos> under the trees , a little group is deep <eos> in laughing talk . the shadow as it flows <eos> across them dims the lustre of a rose <eos> quenches the bright clear gold of hair , the green <eos> of a girl 's dress , and life seems faint . the light <eos> swings back , and in the rose a fire is seen <eos> gold hair 's aflame and green grows emerald bright <eos>
ofttimes i gaze upon thine eyes , fair child <eos> till sense forgets all but the beautiful <eos> and my entranced and raptured heart is full <eos> of blissful visions , pure , and bland , and mild <eos> in their o'erstealing , as the rosy sleep <eos> that falls upon an infant , wafting it <eos> in balmy dreams to heaven . within the deep <eos> the thrilling sea of their blue loveliness <eos> by sun reflected gleams of heaven uplit <eos> my spirit bathes in sweet unconsciousness <eos> of aught material , and oft doth drink <eos> of beauty there , whose freshness never dies <eos> till , pleasure lapt , it feels as it could sink <eos> beneath the waves , and enter paradise <eos>
thine eye the glass where i behold my heart <eos> mine eye the window through the which thine eye <eos> may see my heart , and there thyself espy <eos> in bloody colours how thou painted art <eos> thine eye the pile is of a murdering dart <eos> mine eye the sight thou tak'st thy level by <eos> to hit my heart , and never shoot'st awry <eos> mine eye thus helps thine eye to work my smart <eos> thine eye a fire is both in heat and light <eos> mine eye of tears a river doth become <eos> o that the water of mine eye had might <eos> to quench the flames that from thine eye doth come <eos> or that the fires kindled by thine eye <eos> the flowing streams of mine eyes could make dry <eos>
when in disgrace with fortune and men 's eyes <eos> i all alone beweep my outcast state <eos> and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries <eos> and look upon my self and curse my fate <eos> wishing me like to one more rich in hope <eos> featured like him , like him with friends possessed <eos> desiring this man 's art , and that man 's scope <eos> with what i most enjoy contented least <eos> yet in these thoughts my self almost despising <eos> haply i think on thee , and then my state <eos> ( like to the lark at break of day arising <eos> from sullen earth ) sings hymns at heaven 's gate <eos> for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings <eos> that then i scorn to change my state with kings <eos>
‘ my dearest lord ! farewell , ’ said he , ‘ farewell <eos> heaven bless the king ; may no misfortune tell <eos> the injustice of his hate when i am dead <eos> they 're coming now ; perhaps my guiltless head <eos> here , in your sight , must then a bleeding lie <eos> and scarce your own stand safe for being nigh <eos> think me not scared with death , howe'er ‘ t appear <eos> i know thou canst not think so : it is a fear <eos> from which thy love and dammin speaks me free <eos> i 've met him face to face , and ne'er could see <eos> one terror in his looks to make me fly <eos> when virtue bids me stand ; but i would die <eos> so as becomes my life , so as may prove <eos> saul 's malice , and at least excuse your love <eos>
one is a slow and melancholy maid <eos> i know riot if she cometh from the skies <eos> or from the sleepy gulfs , but she will rise <eos> often before me in the twilight shade <eos> holding a bunch of poppies and a blade <eos> of springing wheat : prostrate my body lies <eos> before her on the turf , the while she ties <eos> a fillet of the weed about my head <eos> and in the gaps of sleep i seem to hear <eos> a gentle rustle like the stir of corn <eos> and words like odours thronging to my ear <eos> “ lie still , beloved — still until the morn <eos> lie still with me upon this rolling sphere <eos> still till the judgment ; thou art faint and worn <eos>
and , like a chorus to the words of grace <eos> the ancient fakir , sitting in his place <eos> motionless as an idol and as grim <eos> in the pavilion akbar built for him <eos> under the court yard trees , ( for he was wise <eos> knew menu 's laws , and through his close shut eyes <eos> saw things far off , and as an open book <eos> into the thoughts of other men could look <eos> began , half chant , half howling , to rehearse <eos> the fragment of a holy vedic verse <eos> and thus it ran : “ he who all things forgives <eos> conquers himself and all things else , and lives <eos> above the reach of wrong or hate or fear <eos> calm as the gods , to whom he is most dear <eos>
“ high words and threats profane this hallowed place <eos> where time rebukes the fuss of human race <eos> and gentle sir , what harm hath he done thee <eos> it is my mother whom he comes to see <eos> lo , how the gods our puny wrath deride <eos> with peace and beauty spread on every side <eos> this earth with pleasure of the spring complete <eos> too bright to dwell on , were it not so sweet <eos> no theft of man it 's affluence impairs <eos> a thousand flowers , without a loss , it spares <eos> whose bashful elegance no brush can trace <eos> heartfelt delight , and plenitude of grace <eos> no palettes match their brilliance , although <eos> pandora filled her box from iris ’ bow <eos>
fond words have oft been spoken to thee , sleep <eos> and thou hast had thy store of tenderest names <eos> the very sweetest words that fancy frames <eos> when thankfulness of heart is strong and deep <eos> dear bosom child we call thee , that dost steep <eos> in rich reward all suffering ; balm that tames <eos> all anguish ; saint that evil thoughts and aims <eos> takest away , and into souls dost creep <eos> like to a breeze from heaven . shall i alone <eos> i surely not a man ungently made <eos> call thee worst tyrant by which flesh is crost <eos> perverse , self will 'd to own and to disown <eos> mere slave of them who never for thee pray 'd <eos> still last to come where thou art wanted most <eos>

if thou art tempted by a thought of ill <eos> crave not too soon for victory , nor deem <eos> thou art a coward if thy safety seem <eos> to spring too little from a righteous will <eos> for there is nightmare on thee , nor until <eos> thy soul hath caught the morning 's early gleam <eos> seek thou to analyze the monstrous dream <eos> by painful introversion ; rather fill <eos> thine eye with forms thou knowest to be truth <eos> but see thou cherish higher hope than this <eos> hope hereafter that thou shall be fit <eos> calm eyed to face distortion , and to sit <eos> transparent among other forms of youth <eos> who own no impulse save to god and bliss <eos>
stranger , this news thou bringest is too great <eos> for instant comment , having many sides <eos> of import , and in silence best received <eos> whether it turn at last to joy or woe <eos> but thou , the zealous bearer , hast no part <eos> in what it hath of painful , whether now <eos> first heard , or in its future issue shown <eos> thou for thy labour hast deserved our best <eos> refreshment , needed by thee , as i judge <eos> with mountain travel and night watching spent <eos> to the guest chamber lead him , some one ! give <eos> all entertainment which a traveller needs <eos> and such as fits a royal house to show <eos> to friends , still more , and labourers in our cause <eos>
bonny and stout and brown , without a hat <eos> she frowns offended when they call her fat <eos> yet fat she is , the merriest in the place <eos> and all can know she wears a pretty face <eos> but still she never heeds what praise can say <eos> but does the work , and oft runs out to play <eos> to run about the yard and ramp and noise <eos> and spring the mop upon the servant boys <eos> when old hens noise and cackle every where <eos> she hurries eager if the eggs are dear <eos> and runs to seek them when they lay away <eos> to get them ready for the market day <eos> she gambols with the men and laughs aloud <eos> and only quarrels when they call her proud <eos>
